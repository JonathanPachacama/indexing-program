The Long-tailed Silky-flycatcher, Ptilogonys caudatus is a 
passerine 
bird which occurs only in the mountains of 






Costa Rica





 and western 

Panama
, usually from 1,850 m altitude to the timberline. It is a 
thrush-sized species weighing about 37 g. The 
silky-flycatchers are related to 
waxwings, and like that group have a soft silky plumage. 


The habitat of this bird is mountain forests, where the breeding pair builds a neat cup of 
lichen 2-18 m high in a tree, sometimes in loose colonies.  The female lays two brown and lilac-blotched grey eggs, which are incubated by both adults. The young fledge 18-25 days after hatching, and are fed by both parents.


The male Long-tailed Silky-flycatcher is 24 cm long and has a pale grey forehead. The rest of the crested head, neck, throat and lower belly are yellow. The back, lower breast and upper belly are blue-grey, and the flight feathers and long pointed tail are black. The outer tail feathers are spotted with white. 


The female is 21 cm long and generally duller than the male, with a darker grey forehead, olive body plumage and a shorter, duller black tail. Immatures are similar to the adults, but the central tail feathers are shorter and the white spotting on the outer tail is indistinct.


This species forages in small flocks when not breeding, flycatching for 
insects or taking small fruits, especially 
mistletoe. Long-tailed Silky-flycatchers often perch prominently on high exposed twigs.


The call of the Long-tailed Silky-flycatcher is a repeated chee-chip.


This species is a host to the biting louse Brueelia ptiliogonis.

Music industry




The term  unsigned artist  is used in the 
music industry to refer to a 
singer, 
songwriter, 
musician, or 
band that has no affiliation with a 
record label. Many unsigned artists sell their music and music-related merchandise without the financial support of a record label, while often seeking a recording contract through the recording of 





demo




s.  The difference between an unsigned artist and an aspiring artist is that aspiring artists in most cases do not sell their music commercially. Recently, the internet has helped promote independent artistic material. Artists tend to post their music on websites such as 

MySpace
, 






ILike





 and yourdub, and sometimes have their music played on podcast shows like Tom Robinson, Indie Launchpad and Low Slung.  In recent times, artists such as Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead, who once had major label record deals, have started to release their music independently.

This is a 
Chinese name; the 
family name is Sang.


Sang Lan (
Simplified Chinese:   ) (born 
June 11, 
1981, 

Ningbo
, 
Zhejiang Province, 
China) is a former Chinese 
gymnast, television personality and student. 


Biography




Athletic career and injury



Sang achieved excellence in gymnastics at a young age, winning the all-around and every single event final at the 
1991 Zhejiang Province Championships. By 
1995 she was competing nationally. Sang was one of China's strongest vaulters, placing second on the event at the 1995 Chinese Nationals. While she never represented China at the Olympics or 
World Gymnastics Championships, she did compete at the 
1996 and 
1997 American Cup meets and was selected for the 
1998 








Goodwill Games







 team.


In 





New York




 at the Goodwill Games, during warmups for the vault event final, Sang fell while she was performing a timer (a simple vault, used by the athlete to familiarize herself with the apparatus and warm up). She could not raise herself from the mat and was taken to the hospital. 


Tests indicated that she had fractured and dislocated her C6 and C7 vertebrae and injured her 
spinal cord. The result of the injury was paralysis from the mid-chest down. 


Sang remained in 

New York City
 for almost a year, receiving rehabilitation at 

Mount Sinai Hospital
. Many celebrities, including 

Leonardo DiCaprio
, 

Celine Dion
 and 

Christopher Reeve
 visited and offered their support; she was also invited to participate in the New Year's Eve festivities in Times Square as an honored guest.




Advocacy



Since returning to China, Sang has become a celebrity and an advocate for the disabled. A television miniseries about her life was produced in the late 1990s; she was portrayed by her former gymnastics teammate 

Mo Huilan
. Sang also hosts her own show, Sang Lan Olympics 2008.  on 
STAR TV, a 

Mandarin
-language television channel. She was an ambassador for Beijing's successful 2008 Olympics bid and has been selected as an Olympic relay torchbearer. 


Sang is currently a student at Peking University. She has continued a rigorous physical therapy regimen and has regained some use of her arms and hands. She has also expressed an interest in returning to competitive sports and wishes to represent China as a 
table tennis player at the 2008 






Paralympic Games

 New York reload  is used to refer to the action of drawing a second 
gun when the first jams or runs empty, rather than 
reloading the first, often providing a slight speed advantage. It originated with 

New York City
 
policemen who would carry a backup 
revolver rather than an unwieldy 
speed loader.

WVCP is the 
college radio 
station of 

Volunteer State Community College
 ( Vol State ) in 

Gallatin
, 





Tennessee




, broadcasting at 88.5 MHz on the 
FM dial. It falls under the oversight of the Department of Humanities and is managed by longtime 
faculty member Howard Espravnik. Students and volunteers make up the airstaff. The station plays a mix of music, ranging from soft 
adult contemporary to 
hard rock. The station is currently operating at a limited capacity due to damage sustained from a tornado directly striking the studios.



Storm damage





WVCP's studios were directly hit by a 










large tornado









 on April 7, 2006. The studios are located on the second floor of the building at the windows seen just left of center. As shown by this image taken from 






WTVF





-TV, the roof above the studios was completely torn off.


 Its studios on the second floor of Noble Caudill Hall were directly in the path of a large tornado that struck the college and killed nine people across the city of Gallatin on 
April 7, 
2006 during the 










April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak









. Part of the building collapsed, and WVCP's studios were a near-total loss. Equipment that was not destroyed by the storm sustained heavy water damage. 


The station was knocked off the air the moment the storm struck, but returned to the air on 
April 13 
2006 in a limited capacity. The station is currently automating from a computer located at the transmitter site. In the Spring 2007 semester, WVCP will again operate at full capacity from a newly-constructed studio in the Ramer Administration Building.


Ironically, a few years earlier, strong straight-line winds caused the station's tower north of Gallatin to topple, forcing WVCP off the air for several weeks before the station relaunched on a new tower in a different location.

Parks Guard Rifle Drill Team, or PG, was founded in 1948 as an Air Force Rifle 
Drill team representing Parks College of Engineering and Aviation, a college of 

Saint Louis University
.


History


Parks Guard was officially founded as a Parks College Student Organization in 1948, but records have shown that it was fully active prior to its establishment. Parks Guard may have first formed as a necessary color guard unit that represented the United States Army Air Corps ROTC program for military ceremonies. The military tie to Parks College is not to surprising because World War Two was in full swing and most, if not all, aviation schools had some sort of military presence; also being the first federally certified aviation program made Parks College an ideal training area for both civilians and military engineers and aviators.


For 59 years, PG has represented Parks College -- the first aviation college in the United States -- making it one of the oldest organizations on the campus. Parks Guard is a varsity Class  A  Rifle Exhibition Drill Team composed of students from the St. Louis area. PG is regarded as one of the strongest teams in the country and annually receives invitations from across the nation to compete. Several factors have led to this outstanding recognition: the team's unique style of marching (the slow 40-step per minute cadence), difficult rifle tosses, and the degree of self-discipline each member has as a result of the program's intense introductory training.


Historically, the majority of Parks Guard alumni have gone on to serve their respective military services; mainly Army, Air Force, and Marines. This is because those three services had a presence around the St. Louis metropolitan area where Parks Guard resides. The Parks Guard alumni vary in rank. From the enlisted ranks of those three services to even as high as Colonels and General Officers. Two things remain the same for all Parks Guard alumni, both civilian and military, and it is the strive for perfection and the bonds they share. 






Mission Statement


Parks Guard is currently reworking its mission statement.

Black Water


August 3, 
2004



English







Black Water is the fifth book in the 
Pendragon series by 








D. J. MacHale







. Four months after Mark and Courtney were faced with 

Saint Dane
 in the root cellar of the old house they find the 16th journal leading to Bobbys journey on 
Eelong...only the rules have been twisted around and changed.



Plot summary



This entire story is unsettling for the characters. Mark, now one of two 
acolytes (librarians for the Travelers' journals) is aghast to find that Andy Mitchell, the school bully, is a scientific 
idiot savant. Courtney Chetwynde, Mark's partner acolyte and one of Bobby's romantic interests, finds that she is no longer the phenomenal athlete of her earlier years. It starts off where  The Reality Bug   left. Bobby says goodbye to Aja Killian and flumes to Eelong. There, Bobby discovers a society wherein humans do only menial work, dominated and even enslaved by biped felines called Klee.


The enslaved humans, called Gar by their oppressors,
have begun a revolution called the 
Advent and are lead by the almighty guardian who is mostly covered by a dark shadow, you can only see his distinct yellow eyes and feathers. At the arranged moment, 
radio broadcasts will be sent from the hidden Gar capital of Black Water through small amber cubes, demanding that the entire Gar population leave their squalid stables at once and march to their capital, where they can be free. Without them, the Klee cannot maintain their standard of living.


Worse, 

Saint Dane
 is trying to stir up 
genocide. To do so, he has poisoned the crops gathered by the races of Eelong, urged the Klee to hunt and eat the Gar, and arranged for Black Water to be bombarded by toxic gases.


It is discovered by the acolytes of 
Second Earth that the poison used by Saint Dane in these plans was taken from the territory of 
Cloral. The only antidote is likewise Cloran, having been developed by the Scientists of 
Faar.


Eager to take an active role in the Travelers' quest, the children go to Cloral and collect the antidote. With them to 
Eelong goes the Cloran Traveler, 


Vo Spader

.


Because the poison, the antidote, and the acolytes are unique to their respective territories, the interrealitial tunnels called 
flumes undergo stress and strain in transporting them.


On Eelong, Bobby has experienced the most degrading aspects of Gar life and learned from them. With the help of the Klee Traveler 


Kasha

, he makes rendezvous with 
Gunny at Black Water. There, Kasha is exposed violently to Saint Dane's evil ways for the first time. This encounter creates a passionate dedication to her destiny.


Travelers and acolytes work together to bring the antidote to Black Water, where it will be distributed throughout the city's irrigation system. When the Klee under Saint Dane's orders use the poison, it is 
made harmless.


Thereafter, the Klee and Gar live as equals, each doing what they do best as well as contributing to one another's success.


Mark and Courtney reluctantly return to Second Earth, while Bobby moves on to 
Zadaa in pursuit of Saint Dane. However, things do not go according to plan. The flume on Eelong is destroyed by the passage of non-Travelers through it, leaving Spader and Gunny trapped on Eelong. Bobby reaches Zadaa, but Kasha gets hit in the head with a boulder which kills her in the collapse of the  flume on Eelong.Bobby, aided by the Traveler 


Loor

, cremates the Klee's body and store her ashes.


On Second Earth, Mark and Courtney are intact and home.


They learn of what happened through Bobby's journals, although amazed that no time has passed on Second Earth since they left for Eelong.


The book ends with Bobby Pendragon writing his 19 journal in Loor's home on Zadaa.


Note: There is spectulation that since there are two flumes on Second Earth, Denduron, and Cloral there might be a new flume on Eelong.  There has been no proof of this yet in the books.

Signal processing
Radar




Swerling models were introduced by 

Peter Swerling
 and are used to describe the statistical properties of the 
radar cross-section of complex objects.


General Target Model


Swerling target models give the RCS of a given object based on the 
chi-square probability density function, which has the following form:




p(\sigma) = \frac{m}{\Gamma(m) \sigma_{av}} \left ( \frac{m\sigma}{\sigma_{av}} \right )^{m - 1} e^{-\frac{m\sigma}{\sigma_{av}}}


\sigma_{av} refers to the 
mean value of sigma. This is not always easy to determine, as certain objects may be viewed the most frequently from a limited range of angles. For instance, a sea-based radar system is most likely to view a ship from the side, the front, and the back, but never the top or the bottom. m is the number of 
degrees of freedom divided by 2. While the number of degrees of freedom used in the chi-square probability density function is an integer value in statistics, it can assume any positive real number in the target model. Values of m between .3 and 2 have been found to closely approximate certain simple shapes, such as cylinders or cylinders with fins.


Since the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value of the chi-square pdf is equal to m-1/2, larger values of m will result in less fluctuations. If m equals infinity, the target's RCS is non-fluctuating.




Swerling Target Models


Swerling target models are special cases of the Chi-Square target models with specific degrees of freedom. There are five different Swerling models, numbered I through V:



Swerling I


A model where the RCS varies according to a Chi-square probability density function with two degrees of freedom (m = 1). This applies to a target that is made up of many independent scatterers of roughly equal areas. As little as half a dozen scattering surfaces can produce this distribution. Swerling I describes a target whose radar cross-section is constant throughout a single scan, but varies independently from scan to scan. In this case, the pdf reduces to




p(\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma_{av}} e^{-\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_{av}}}


Swerling I has been shown to be a good approximation when determining the RCS of objects in aviation.




Swerling II


Similar to Swerling I, except the RCS values returned are independent from pulse to pulse, instead of scan to scan.




Swerling III


A model where the RCS varies according to a Chi-square probability density function with four degrees of freedom (m = 2). This PDF approximates an object with one large scattering surface with several other small scattering surfaces. The RCS is constant through a single scan just as in Swerling I. The pdf becomes




p(\sigma) = \frac{4\sigma}{\sigma_{av}^2} e^{-\frac{2\sigma}{\sigma_{av}}}






Swerling IV


Similar to Swerling III, but the RCS varies from pulse to pulse rather than from scan to scan.




Swerling V (Also known as Swerling 0)


Constant RCS (m \to infinity).

Diana Beatriz Conti (born 
March 29, 
1956 in 

Buenos Aires
) is an 


Argentine

 lawyer and politician. She is a member of the 

Argentine Chamber of Deputies
 and a former 

national senator
. 

Conti was born to Horacio Conti, a travelling salesman, and Martha Bascuas, a housewife who later qualified as a teacher. Bascuas was 17 when she gave birth to Diana, and the young Conti spent her early years at her grandparents' house. She was known in 
high school for her high grades. On 
December 16, 
1980, she obtained her 
law degree from the 

University of Buenos Aires
. Having graduated as a lawyer, she continued studying, while working at the same time. From 1981 to 198], she worked at her own law firm, and in 1982, she joined the social assistance team for prisoners in Ravignaggi-Garriga, and the judicial assistance department of the center for legal and social studies in Argentina. Politically, meanwhile, she was active for many years in the 
Revolutionary Communist Party. In 1983, she became chairman of a company named 
Corsetti S.A., a job from which she stepped down in 1985. 


She was also a member of the contradictory cases legal assistance team from 1982 to 1985, and a public helper of problem youth from 1984 to 1985. On 
September 10, 
1985, Conti formed part of an advisory council on human rights in Argentina. 


1985 was a very productive year for Conti, who graduated with a degree in 
psychology that year. She tried to become secretary of first and second instance criminal forums in 1985 and in June 1989, losing narrowly both times in voting.  In 1986, she became national secretary of first instance, on the correctional and criminal jury for first instance. Conti held that job until 
January 31, 
1989. She had become a founding member of the citizen's correctional justice participation system organization's commission, and from 
February 1, 
1989, she was secretary of the national appeals chamber, a job which she held until 
April 1, 
1991.


Conti became the justice minister's cabinet helper in 1991. She held various administrative positions in Buenos Aires until 1994, when she left for 













Santa Fe












, where she worked as 
Eugenio Raul Zaffaroni's legal helper for one month. She got a job on 
March 16 of that year as the 

University of Buenos Aires
' penal rights and criminology department's secretary, so traveling between Buenos Aires and Santa Fe daily became a burden to Conti, who decided to quit her job in Santa Fe after only one month working there. 


Conti became Argentina's human rights subsecretary on 
December 12, 
1997, and she left her job at Buenos Aires University to concentrate on her new job. On 
December 26, 
2001, she stepped down from that position, aiming to become a subsecretary for institutional reform and national strengthening of democracy in Argentina, a job that she obtained on 
January 23, 
2002. 


Conti had to step down from her new position however on 
July 2, when she was appointed as a national senator representing Buenos Aires Province for the 
FrePaSo party to complete the term of 
Raul Alfonsin, having been number two on his list at the 2001 election. She was a senator from 
July 3, 
2002 until 
December 10, 
2005.  As senator, she was known for championing human rights causes. Although a member of FrePaSo, she was already seen as close to the 
Peronists, who she had served as a minister. Eventually she joined 









President








 
Nestor Kirchner's 

Front for Victory
 bloc in her time in the Senate.
In December 2005, she was elected a deputy for 









Buenos Aires Province








 for the Front for Victory.


During April 2006, Conti returned to the public light when she began a campaign in favour of laws for harsher punishment to those found guilty of 
sexual harassment at work, regardless of sexual gender. A 
divorced woman, Conti has participated in several seminars and law clinics in Argentina.

Souvenir of 100th performance



Ivanhoe is a romantic 
opera in three acts based on the 







novel






 by 




Sir Walter Scott



, with 
music by 
Sir Arthur Sullivan and a 
libretto by 








Julian Sturgis







. It premiered at the 
Royal English Opera House on 31 January 1891 for a consecutive run of 155 performances, unheard of for a 
grand opera.1  Later that year it was performed six more times, for a total of 161 performances.2


History


By 1891, 
Richard D'Oyly Carte had earned great wealth as the impresario who produced the 
Savoy Operas, with music by Sullivan and librettos by 



W. S. Gilbert


. Carte built the Royal English Opera House with the idea of doing for English grand opera what he had already done for light opera, and he commissioned Sullivan to write the venture's inaugural work.  The composer asked Gilbert to supply the 
libretto, but the latter declined, saying that in grand opera the librettist's role is subordinate to that of the composer.  However, Gilbert recommended Sturgis to write the libretto.  Departing from the usual practice for grand opera, Carte's opera house did not have a 
repertory. Instead, it presented Ivanhoe every night, with alternative singers being provided for the chief roles - not as separate 'first' and 'second' casts, but in different mixtures.3  One cast member who went on to a fine career was the young 
tenor, 



Joseph O'Mara


, in the title role.  







R. Scott Fishe






, a member of the chorus, later became a principal performer with the 


D'Oyly Carte Opera Company

 at the 

Savoy Theatre
.  No expense was spared to make the production a success, including a double cast and  every imaginable effect of scenic splendour4.  The opera ran for an unprecedented 155 consecutive performances.2





Standard programme cover



Ivanhoe closed in July, when the opera house closed for the summer at the end of the opera season.  When the house re-opened in November, Carte had no new work to replace it.  He programmed 
Andre Messager's La Basoche (with 








David Bispham







 in his first London stage performance) alternating in repertory with Ivanhoe, and then La Basoche alone, closing in January 1892.  Notwithstanding Ivanhoe's success, the opera house was a failure, as Carte had not provided for a repertory to keep it open.  It was, as critic Hermann Klein observed,  the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise! 5  Sir 
Henry Wood, who had been repetiteur for the production, recalled in his autobiography that  [if] Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one, I believe he would have established English opera in London for all time. Towards the end of the run of Ivanhoe I was already preparing the 
Flying Dutchman with 
Eugene Oudin in the name part. He would have been superb. However, plans were altered and the Dutchman was shelved. 6  Carte sold the theatre within a year, and it was renamed the Palace Theatre of Varieties.  The building is known today as the 

Palace Theatre
.


There was a successful touring revival by the 
Carl Rosa Opera Company in a cut version from December 1894 to June 1895 (the opera originally ran almost four hours) and then again in the autumn of 1895, and an unsuccessful production in Berlin.  Then, apart from two performances in 
Sir Thomas Beecham's 1910 season at the 




Royal Opera House



, Ivanhoe disappeared from the professional repertory.  The opera was broadcast on 
BBC Radio on 25 March 1929, with the London Wireless Orchestra conducted by 













Percy Pitt












, who had conducted the 1910 performances.


Numerous other composers also wrote operas based on Scott's Ivanhoe, including John Parry, 
Otto Nicolai (Il Templario), and 







Heinrich Marschner






 (
Der Templer und die Judin).

Synopsis


In 1891, the audience knew Scott's best-selling novel intimately.  Sullivan and Sturgis relied on this fact, and so the opera intentionally dramatises disconnected scenes from the book and does not attempt to retell the whole story.  This presents a challenge to modern audiences who may be far less familiar with the story.7



Act I


Scene 1: The Hall of Cedric of Rotherwood. Evening.


As Cedric's men prepare supper, he laments the King's many journeys abroad, the scurrilous behavior of the Norman knights, and the absence of his estranged son, Ivanhoe.  Isaac of York, a Jew, enters and asks for shelter.  Although Cedric considers Isaac's race accursed, he will not refuse Saxon hospitality.  A squire announces Sir Brian de Bois Guilbert and Maurice de Bracy, of the Knights Templar, who are on their way to a Royal tournament at Ashby de la Zouche.  They are Normans, and Cedric, a Saxon, loathes them.  However, they too are granted hospitality.  Ivanhoe is with them, in disguise.  De Bracy asks after Cedric's fair ward, Rowena.  Cedric notes that she will only marry a Saxon.  Ivanhoe tells of a tournament he witnessed in the Holy Land where the English knights soundly defeated the Templars.  Sir Brian was beaten by Ivanhoe, whom he wishes to challenge again.  Rowena and the disguised Ivanhoe, whom no one recognizes, assure Sir Brian that Ivanhoe will meet his challenge.  After Rowena exits, Sir Brian and de Bracy agree that they will abduct her after the tournament at Ashby.


Scene 2: An Ante-Chamber in the Hall at Rotherwood


Rowena laments the absence of her lover, Ivanhoe.  He enters, still disguised as a holy palmer.  She tells him that she hopes to be with Ivanhoe again.  Ivanhoe tells Isaac that he has overheard Sir Brian planning to seize him the next day.  Isaac 
promises to equip Ivanhoe (whom he recognises as a knight) with a horse and armour, and Ivanhoe in turn promises that, if they fly Cedric's hall directly, Isaac will be safe with him.  They leave for the tournament at Ashby.


Scene 3: The Tournament at Ashby



Richard Green as Prince John



At the tournament, King Richard, disguised as the Black Knight, has made a great impression with his victories.  Prince John enters with Rowena, who has been named Queen of Beauty for the tournament.  The Prince shrugs off a message that his brother, the King, has escaped from France.  The Prince asks for challengers to the Knights Templar.  Ivanhoe, now in disguise as the Disinherited Knight, challenges Sir Brian.  In a fierce clash, Ivanhoe again defeats Sir Brian, but is himself wounded.  Ignoring Ivanhoe's protest, a Herald removes his helmet at Prince John's command so that he may be crowned victor of the tournament, and he is recognized by Cedric and Rowena. 




Act II




Note: In the original design of the opera, the first two scenes of Act II were to have come in the reverse order. The present sequence was adopted to eliminate a time-consuming mid-act scene change. However, it introduced the anomaly that King Richard learns of Cedric and Rowena's capture before the audience has actually seen it on stage.


Scene 1: Friar Tuck's Hut, in the Forest at Copmanhurst


King Richard, who is in hiding after his escape, shares a feast with Friar Tuck and challenges him to a song contest.  The King sings  I ask nor wealth nor courtier's praise,  while the Friar sings  Ho, jolly Jenkin  (which is the most popular detached excerpt from the opera).  Locksley (Robin Hood) enters with the urgent message that Cedric and Rowena have been captured by de Bracy and Sir Brian, and the wounded Ivanhoe, travelling with Isaac and his beautiful daughter Rebecca, have also been captured.  All are imprisoned at Torquilstone.  The King, Locksley, Friar Tuck and all the outlaws rush off to rescue them.


Scene 2: A Passageway in Torquilstone


Cedric and Rowena are prisoners, and De Bracy plans to forcibly marry her.  De Bracy tells them that Ivanhoe, Isaac and Rebecca, are also prisoners.  He promises that Ivanhoe will be safe if Rowena and Cedric comply with his wishes.  Cedric is prepared to sacrifice Ivanhoe, but Rowena begs him to be merciful to them, as well as to Ivanhoe.  She appeals to his 
honour, as a Knight and, begging him to save Ivanhoe, she promises to pray for de Bracy.  After they have left, Sir Brian enters, and declares passionately his intention to woo, and win, Rebecca.


Scene 3: A Turret Chamber in Torquilstone


Ulrica warns Rebecca that she faces an evil and dark fate, and that death is the only path to safety.  The despondent Rebecca prays for God's protection.  Sir Brian enters, intent on winning Rebecca.  He asks her to submit to him, promising to raise her to the throne of kings and to cover her with jewels.  She leaps on the parapet, threatening to jump.  A bugle sounds, heralding the arrival of King Richard and his forces.  Sir Brian rushes off to defend the castle.

Scene 1: A Room in Torquilstone


Ivanhoe, pale and weak from his wounds, thinks of his love for Rowena, and falls asleep.  Rebecca, who is in love with Ivanhoe, enters to tend him.  When they hear distant trumpets, Rebecca goes to a window and describes the unfolding battle to the frustrated Ivanhoe, who complains that he is unable to participate.  Ulrica sets the castle on fire.  Sir Brian enters and carries off Rebecca.  Ivanhoe is unable to protect her.  At the last minute, King Richard enters the chamber and rescues Ivanhoe from the conflagration.


Scene 2: In the Forest


King Richard and Ivanhoe rest in a forest. De Bracy has been captured. The King sends him to Prince John with an ultimatum to surrender. Cedric and Rowena appear. At the King's urging, Cedric is reconciled with Ivanhoe, and agrees to Ivanhoe's marriage with Rowena.  Isaac enters in haste. The Templars have accused Rebecca of witchcraft, and sentenced her to burn at the stake. Ivanhoe rushes out to rescue her.


Scene 3: The Preceptory of the Templars, Templestowe


The funeral pyre has been built.  Rebecca will be burned at the stake unless a champion is willing to fight for her.  Sir Brian urges them to relent, but the Templars take his irrational passion as further evidence of her witchcraft.  Sir Brian offers to save her if she will agree to be his, but Rebecca refuses.  Rebecca is bound to the stake.  The exhausted Ivanhoe arrives with his sword drawn, offering to fight for her.  Rebecca tries to dissuade him, fearing that the wounded knight cannot prevail.  Sir Brian attacks Ivanhoe, who appears to be beaten.  But as Sir Brian is about to strike the fatal blow, he falls dead.  The Templars regard this as proof of God's judgement and Rebecca's innocence, and she is freed.  She gazes wistfully at Ivanhoe as he is reunited with Rowena, who has entered with Cedric and King Richard.  The King banishes the Templars from English soil.





Recordings and books


A 1989 recording was made by The Prince Consort.8  A 1995 hour-long  compressed version  was recorded and presented by Roderic Dunnett (the  Opera Now  magazine reviewer) for his BBC radio  Britannia at the Opera  series.9  A 1998 CD, Sullivan   Co.: The Operas That Got Away features two songs from the opera.10  Two soprano arias from Ivanhoe were recorded by 
Deborah Riedel with 












Richard Bonynge











 and the Opera Australia orchestra on The Power of Love - British Opera Arias (1999, Melba MR 30110).  A professional recording of Ivanhoe by Chandos is being planned for release in 2009-10,9


In 2008, a book was published about Ivanhoe and its 19th century  precursors  by Jeff S. Dailey, based on his 2002 doctoral dissertation for 

New York University
.  Dailey explains why Scott's novels, Ivanhoe in particular, were frequently adapted.  He discusses the text and music of the opera.  In his chapter on criticism of the opera (Chapter 9), he notes that Ivanhoe received generally favorable reviews early on, except from 



George Bernard Shaw


, but that later critics, some of whom probably never saw the work, tended to be dismissive.9


In 2007, the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society published a booklet, edited by David Eden, containing information about the opera including original articles, contemporary reviews and news articles.11

To bloviate means  to speak pompously and excessively,  or  to expound ridiculously.  A colloquial verb 
coined in the 








United States







, it is commonly used with contempt to describe the behavior of politicians, academics, pundits  or media  experts,  sometimes called bloviators, who hold forth on subjects in an arrogant, tiresome way.

Some speculate that bloviate derives from adding a faux-

Latin
 ending to the verb 'to blow' or boast, following a 19th-century fad of adding Latin-like 
affixes to ordinary words. However, others like 

William Safire
 claim that 'bloviate' comes from combining the words 'blow-hard' and 'deviation.'


Although 'bloviate' is listed in slang dictionaries as far back as the 19th century, the term was popularized by President 



Warren G. Harding


 in the 1920s. Famed for his poor English usage, Harding often used the word to describe his long, winding speaking style. The term dropped from popular usage following his presidency but was resurrected in the 1960s when it was sometimes used in reference to Harding. 


It became widely spoken again in the 1990s. Today, it appears regularly in 

The New York Times
, 

The New Yorker
 and the 
Washington Post. 


The term is used frequently by Fox News commentator, 



Bill O'Reilly


 whose show, 

The O'Reilly Factor
 concludes with requests for email.  The request for feedback, sometimes includes:  Please do not bloviate, [that's] my job.  


'Bloviating' has taken on new life in the blogosphere, used derisively to identify and otherwise chide the most pompous of contributors to message boards and forums.

Sergei Muromtsev



Sergei Andreevich Muromtsev (

Russian
:                          ) (
October 5, 
1850   
October 4, 
1910) was a 

Russian
 lawyer and politician, and chairman of the First 
Imperial Duma in 1906.

Muromtsev was a Russian nobleman from 








Tula







 and a Professor of 
Roman Law at 
Moscow University. In the late 19th century, he was among the creators of the Constitutional Democratic Party, better known as the KD or 

Cadet
 party, of which he was chairman for several years. In April 1906, he was elected as a representative for Moscow in the 
First Duma, of which he was then elected chairman (or president) on May 10. He tried to maintain some degree of order and dignity in this difficult assembly, which is often known as the  Duma of the Public Anger . He was much praised for the way he chaired the debates, always keeping to the strictest legality, but always pursuing a constitutional and anti-
autocratic agenda. Despite his efforts, the Duma was dissolved on July 21, 1906, by Imperial 
ukase of 
tsar 
Nicholas II. Muromtsev wanted the elected Duma to continue its work and proposed that it should retreat to 

Finland
. For signing this appeal, he was imprisoned for some months and could not be re-elected in the later Dumas.


His funeral at the 









Donskoy Monastery








 on October 7, 1910 was the occasion of one of the first public demonstrations of support for constitutional ideas since the dissolution of the Duma. His niece, Vera Muromtseva, was the wife of 

Ivan Bunin
, a celebrated Russian author.

Plot outline


Daphne is a fan of Dr Honey Snow's self-help books, which feature advice such as  time is a concept known to only one of earth's creatures. Just for today, be a sunflower  and  nothing ventured, nothing gained . Frasier regards them as tacky and simplistic, remarking that  after one page I found myself yearning for the worldly cynicism of 

Barney the Dinosaur
 . 


However, when he sees what she looks like his opinion of her magically changes. He meets her and she asks him out. The problem is that she wants him to write the foreword for her next book, and his attempts to sound enthusiastic are unconvincing.


Meanwhile, Niles invests $500 through his broker Wendell on Daphne's behalf, and wins her $200. She decides to reinvest her winnings, but when the company fails, Niles instead tells her she's gained, and pays her his own money, as he enjoys the physical affection he gets when he tells her. Frasier notes that this is a form of  
the world's oldest profession , but Niles makes him see that his own situation is similar (even though Niles' woman is 

English
).


When Frasier tells Honey of his views on the book, she is impressed, admitting that the book is a rush job. Just when it seems like Frasier is on to a winner, they start telling what they dislike of each other, and Frasier lets slip that his opinion applies to her whole body of work. Furious, Honey throws him out.

Memorable Quotations


Frasier expresses his contempt for Dr. Snow's books when asked to go to her 
book signing on Daphne's behalf
Frasier: I would sooner attend a 
hoedown!


Niles has advised Daphne to reinvest her money from the sale of her shares. Frasier walks in and wonders why she looks so excited
Daphne: Well, your brother just gave me $200, and now he's going to roll me over.


Niles is laughing while perusing Dr. Snow's manuscript
Frasier: Niles, will you please stop giggling? It's very distracting.
Niles: I can't help it. Have you read this?
Frasier: I'm trying to recommend a book. Reading it doesn't help.




Trivia





 After Roz obtains Honey's autograph for Frasier, he suggests she pay for the book so they can get out of the store. Roz then introduces Honey to Frasier, and although she never leaves to pay for the book, she leaves the store with the book in hand.

modernised 

Pansori
,  
Techno

1969 Present


Gyeonggi, 

Korea





Epaksa (   ) is a 
Korean entertainer who has recently risen to super stardom in Japan. Born 
October 5, 
1954 in 

Gyeonggi-do
,  his birth name is Yong-sug Lee (   ).


History


While growing up, his parents taught him 
pansori, which he has contemporized by incorporating modern, often Western, pop hooks. His reputation started to build based on his unique way of entertaining. While singing, he would imitate the sound of all of the instruments used in the prelude and interlude, and even the sound of the whistle used to gather the tourists.


After almost 20 years of performing on a 
tour bus, in 1989, the owner of a renowned 
nightclub who was also a 
producer offered him a deal with total creative control. His first album, Sinbaram Epaksa Vol. 1, (the Elation of Epaksa) was an instant hit. Over 1,000,000 cassettes were sold and Epaksa became a hot new sensation for the Korean middle class. His fame earned him a spot on a popular program at the time, 
Inganshidae (    ) on 


MBC

. Following various guest spots on talk shows, he served for one whole year as co-host on an MBC daytime program, 
Naegohyangsohshic (     ) ( News from my hometown ). Fueled by the heat of his first album s success, he released 19 more cassettes in the same year selling millions of copies. To this date he has released 25 albums.


His music often overlooked by Korean teenagers, Epaksa and his team decided to target the 
Japanese market. Up until that time no Korean artist had boomed in Japan and distributors were looking for something new. Around the Fall of 1995, a small indie Japanese label introduced Epaksa to Japan with a CD of his signature style vocals accompanied by his synthesizer beats. Fortunately, the president of Sony Music Japan was a fan and pushed for an album to be produced in Japan. 


In the Spring of 1996 Encyclopedia of Pon-Chak Party 1   2 was released. Here his music style changed, singing words and lyrics as opposed to just sounds and vocalizations. Released later that same year was 2002 E-Pak-Sa s Space Odyssey and 5cm Higher and Rising!. Sales were initially slow, but steady. Sony s package as  Korea s Disco Emperor  enabled him to land a gig as 
spokes-model for a large 
cosmetics company in Japan. Epaksa's appearance in the commercial as a foreigner singing in his native tongue was unprecedented, and launched him into superstardom in Japan.

Dina Mann (born 1950) is an 
Australian actress recognised for several television 
soap opera and film roles in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the 1970s Mann specialised in playing characters much younger than herself in adult-themed dramas and comedies. Her roles in Australian television programs, including several appearances in the 


Crawford Productions

 police dramas 

Homicide
, 












Division 4











, 
















Matlock Police















, were nearly all teenage characters. Her first television role was in an episode of 
Delta where she played a 15-year-old who appeared in a semi-nude swimming scene. Mann also played a schoolgirl in the hit sex-comedy feature film 

Alvin Purple
 (1973) and was a young female cricketer in its 1974 sequel 

Alvin Purple Rides Again
.


She later played the key role of schoolgirl Debbie Chester in adult soap opera 

Number 96
. She joined the show in late 1975 and continued until its final episode in August 1977. She subsequently played guest roles in prison-based soap opera  

Prisoner
, first appearing as the rebellious Debbie, the daughter of Ken Pearce (

Tom Oliver
), in 1980 and again in 1981. She reappeared in the series in 1983 playing a different character, and made other guest appearances in Australian television series until the mid-1980s.


Since the mid-1980s she has worked as a casting director on various Australian films and television productions.

Station interior/




Bratislavskaya (

Russian
:              ) is a station on the 

Moscow Metro
's 




Lyublinskaya Line



. The station was opened 
25 December, 
1996 as part of the southeastern extension of the second stage of the Lyublinsky radius.


Named after the 

Slovak
 capital 












Bratislava











 in honour of the Russo-Slovak friendship, the station is a pillar bi-span. The station's main theme is designed accordingly (architects A.Orlov and A.Nekrasov). The station's length is interrupted with a central square vacuum space that was to serve as a future transfer for the large ring beginning from the 




Kakhovskaya Line



. However the large ring programme has been redesigned and as a result the future transfer will take place at 



Pechatniki


. It is expected that this vaulted space will be covered up as the rest of the station is.

The current architectural decoration is that the two spans are vaulted with suspended lighting hanging from the apexes of the vault. The middle pillar row drops from the joining point of the vaults. The pillars are faced with wavy turquoise marble as are the walls. The floor is out of checkered black and grey granite, except in the future transfer poin where the floor is wholly grey.  Also decorating the station are four medallions located in the four points above the pillar rows with views of Moscow and Bratislava (








Bratislava Castle







, 
Devin Castle, the residence of the Mayor of Moscow, and the 






Cathedral of Christ the Saviour





.


The station has two underground vestibules located under the Pererva street and Myachkovsky boulevard.

The front of a Czech identity card.






The back of a Czech identity card.



The Ob ansky pr kaz (pronounced ; Czech for civic certificate) is the 
national identification card used in the 

Czech Republic
 (and formerly in 

Czechoslovakia
), in addition to the 
Czech passport. It is issued to all citizens above 15 years of age, and every such person permanently living in the Czech Republic is required by law to hold a valid identity card'.1

Since 
1 January 
2006, it has been possible for citizens of the Czech Republic to travel anywhere within the 

European Union
 using only this card.



History


The first mandatory identity document was introduced during the 
German occupation, on 
17 March 
1939 in a decree made by Reichsprotektor 

Konstantin von Neurath
. This document was based on the model of a similar document already in use in the 
Third Reich and included a photograph. Known as a legitimace, it was often nicknamed kennkarta.


During the communist regime (
1948 89) this simple card developed into a booklet dozens of pages long. It contained such personal details as employment history and 
vaccination records.




Requirements


To acquire the card, one must present a filled out application, one photograph if the pr kaz is of the machine readable type or two photographs if it is not of the machine readable type
and if this is an application for a renewal the previous pr kaz, otherwise a birth certificate and proof of citizenship.




Photograph


The photograph(s) must be 35x45 mm, correspond to the current look of the person, show the person looking forwards with the distance from the eyes to the chin at least 13 mm, in civil clothes, without dark glasses (except the blind), without any head cover (except for health/religious reasons, then it cannot cover the face in a way that makes the person difficult to distinguish). The photograph must be smooth.

1912 births




Rabbi Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman (also: Aaron Leib Shteinman, Shtainman or Steinman) (                       )  (b. 1912) is a prominent 
Haredi 
rabbi currently living in 




Bnei Brak



, 

Israel
. 

He belongs to the 
Lithuanian branch of 
Judaism, and heads a division of the famed 
Ponevezh yeshiva (
rosh yeshiva of Ponovezh Litze'irim.) He was formerly the Rosh 





Kollel




 ( head ) of the 
Ponevezh Kollel. He is considered one of the most renowned Haredi rabbis living today. He is a backer of the 
Kupat Ha'ir charitable organization. His scholarly works on the 
Talmud were originally published anonymously under the name Ayelet HaShachar (alluding to his initials in 

Hebrew
, as well as the  morning star  of 
Psalms 22). He married Tamar (Tema) Kornfeld (d. 2002), a descendant of 
Moshe Chaim Rotenberg of 
Khentshin.



Israeli politics



Along with Rabbi 

Yosef Sholom Eliashiv
, Rabbi Shteinman is a leader of the Haredi 



Degel HaTorah


 political party. He therefore exerts much political power in the 

United Torah Judaism
 (UTJ)  political coalition. UTJ is an alliance of Degel HaTorah and the 



Agudat Israel


 party. He is very close with the 
Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi 

Yaakov Aryeh Alter
, a major supporter of Agudat Israel.




Travels abroad



Rabbi Shteinman undertook to visit key Haredi communities outside of Israel when he was in his nineties. In 2005 he visited a number of cities in North America with significant Haredi populations or institutions, such as in 

Brooklyn
, 





New York




 and 
Passaic, 

New Jersey
 , meeting with many prominent American Haredi rabbis including Rabbi 
Aharon Schechter of 









Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin








. 


He travelled to the Jewish community of 
Los Angeles on 
Lag Ba'omer in 2006 during a recent trip to America. Over five thousand Orthodox Jews attended the gathering. He planned to travel together with the Rabbi 

Yaakov Aryeh Alter
 the 
Gerrer Rebbe to 

Montreal
 in May 2006, but they delayed their trip to avoid protests from the 
anti-Zionist 
Neturei Karta. After visiting Montreal, the rabbis parted ways. The Gerrer Rebbe continued to New York and then returned to Jerusalem, while Rabbi Shteinman went on to visit the Jewish communities in several South American cities, including 


Mexico City

 and 

Buenos Aires
. 


In May 2007 Rabbi Steinman visited France, then England, where he addressed large gatherings in Manchester and Gateshead.




Internationally revered



During the 
2008 South Ossetia War the 
Prime Minister of Georgia, 
Vladimer Gurgenidze requested a blessing from Rabbi Shteinman. The Rabbi via telephone  blessed the Jewish community of Georgia and all who live in that place. 1

Costa Rican footballers




Pastor Fernandez was a football player in the National League of Costa Rica during the 1980s.

He became a national sports hero during the 1990 World Cup qualification, when he headed in the winning goal against El Salvador; that victory allowed Costa Rica to qualify for its first World Cup.


During the previous games 











Evaristo Coronado










 had been the hero of the Costa Rican squad with his goals, most of which were headers. For the final game, however, Coronado was injured and Fernandez was picked as his replacement.


Just as Coronado had been doing during the qualifying round, Fernandez headed in the winning goal.


But he was not chosen by Coach 
Velibor Milutinovic to go with the team to Italy, a decision he took very badly, feeling unappreciated.  In protest, he gave up the sport and disappeared from the football scene.  Coronado was also dropped for the World Cup, but he did continue his career.  This contrast highlighted Fernandez's decision as an impetuous one, and although many Costa Ricans remember his name and appreciate his goal, few can mention his other accomplishments.

Lorissa McComas (b. 
November 26, 
1970 in 

Columbus, Ohio
) is a brunette 
lingerie, 
nude and 
softcore model frequently featured in 

Playboy
 during the 1990s. She had a large breast enhancement to give her a 34D-23-34 figure on her 5'5  frame, and started a successful  
Strip-o-gram  business after college. After running into prudery in Ohio she left for 
Los Angeles to pursue a modeling and acting career.

The majority of her work consisted of nude modeling and acting in a variety of softcore productions with simulated or obscured sexual contact, in addition to bit parts in B-movies. In 1997, she appeared in a small number of amateur productions which include small screen and large screen appearances. A large part of Lorissa's fame as a model was her willingness to pose nude exposing her 
vagina.


Lorissa's website, http://www.lorissa.com went offline sometime in 2005, but reappeared in July 2006.

Two students share and compare their learning logs.



Learning logs are a 
personalized learning resource for children. In the learning logs, the children record their responses to learning challenges set by their teachers. Each log is a unique record of the child's thinking and learning. The logs are usually a visually oriented development of earlier established models of learning journals, which can become an integral part of the teaching and learning program and have had a major impact on their drive to develop a more independent learner.


Model support


The importance of learners becoming aware of their own thought processes and gaining insights into the strategies they use to resolve problems, or overcome difficulties.1 There is also critical need for students to become actively involved in the process of learning.2 


Research findings indicating that journals of this type are likely to increase 
metacognition through students becoming more aware of their own thought processes.3 Research using a  thinking book  which investigated the development of reflective thinking skills in children.4


This model of learning logs differs significantly from these earlier models by introducing a greater opportunity for the children to introduce colourful graphic and physical representations to illustrate their thinking and learning, rather than simply relying on the written word. Much of the development of learning logs built on practical classroom applications of mapping and visual tools.56 This has generated a motivation to engage in the process of reflective learning in students who have had more difficulty in expressing themselves through the conventional written form. The use of the learning logs has extended now to schools in Australia, Canada and Thailand in addition to their extensive use in schools throughout the UK. An outline of some of the practical applications of the learning logs along with a number of illustrations of the innovative thinking which has emerged as a product of this visual learning tool.7




 Use and scope of learning logs 





Closeup of a child's Learning log



The process of using learning logs involves developing thinking and learning skills, which are enhanced by a peer partnership system. In this peer system, the children are encouraged to discuss and share their thoughts, as well as to develop their learning logs in a collaborative way. They also give the opportunity for the students to provide feedback to their teachers in order to help extend and elaborate their understanding.





A child's learning log



The learning log allows teachers to quickly and easily share weekly teaching objectives with the children. Once set up the children then take the lead role in sharing and developing their knowledge and understanding and displaying this in a range of styles. The learning log is not an in depth assessment tool but more of a snapshot of what the students have or have not understood in their lesson material.


The learning log can be used at any key stage and for a range of learning activities. It addresses the current creative agenda and has had considerable success with students of a more challenging nature.

Telnyashka with stripes coloured in black. Designated 



Soviet


 and then 

Russian
 naval infantry.



A telnyashka (ru.          ) is a dark blue blue and white striped, sleeveless or not, undershirt worn by sailors of the 

Russian Navy
, the Soviet and Russian Airborne Forces (the 
VDV) and the 
Russian Naval Infantry (Marines).  It is a symbol of great pride for its bearers, perhaps best exemplified by the famed Soviet sniper 
Vassili Zaitsev.  Zaitsev was a sailor in the 
Soviet Pacific Fleet who volunteered for army duty in the 

Battle of Stalingrad
, but despite transfer to the army he refused to give up his Navy telnyashka because of the pride it engendered. General Margelov who was later to modernise the Soviet airborne forces had served with a 
Naval Infantry unit in the 
Great Patriotic War and procured telnyashkas for the airborne forces as a mark of their elite status. There is a popular saying that ironically presents telnyashkas as an attribute of  real men :          ,                   !  (Nas malo, no my v telnyashkakh   We are few in number, but we wear telnyashkas!).

Telnyashkas are also available to the civilian customers and may come in a variety of knittings. Single thread knitting is the standard military-issue variant, but double and quadruple knittings for increased warmth can be produced. A quadruple telnyashka is enough to keep a person warm with nothing else on even at 5 C, as it was originally developed for military divers to be worn under a dry suit.


Telnyashkas come from a practice that originated in the merchants and fishermen of 

Brittany
, who adopted the style to distinguish them from other nationalities at a distance, later adopted and popularized by the 
French Navy and other navies of the 
pre-Dreadnought era. These continued in use for some time. The tradition of Russian/Soviet ground troops wearing a naval uniform comes from 

Soviet Navy
 sailors who fought on the ground whilst under siege during 







World War II






.


Telnyashkas with stripes of different colors than navy blue are usually a mark of a special detachment, for example:



 
Cornflower blue - 
VDV paratroopers, 

GRU
 



Spetsnaz





 
Light green - FSB 






Border Guards








 
Red - 



OMON


 and 



Spetsnaz


 detachments of 
MVD


 
Black - 
Naval Infantry

Kh ne-ye Abb s h 1 or  Abbasis' House  is a large traditional historical house located in 

Kashan
, 

Isfahan Province
, 

Iran
.

Built during the late 1700s, the house is a beautiful example of Kashani residential architecture. It is said to have been the property of a famous cleric. It has six courtyards that would fit the needs of different families.


It is located near the 
Tabatabaei House in the old historic neighborhood of Kashan.


One of the chambers has a ceiling designed with mirror pieces so as to give the impression of a starry sky under the nocturnal glitter of candlelight. The house also was designed with secret passageways, perhaps designed for the escape of the family in times of invasion and emergencies.


The house is now a museum and is protected by 
Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization.

MediaNews Group






The Redwood City Daily News is a 
free daily newspaper in 

Redwood City, California
 published 6 days a week with an average daily circulation of 8,000. The newspaper was founded 
August 9, 
2000 by 
Dave Price (journalist) and Jim Pavelich, who also published the 

Palo Alto Daily News
. The Redwood City Daily News was adjudicated as a newspaper of general circulation by the San Mateo County Superior Court in 2001, enabling it to publish legal notices. Both the Palo Alto and Redwood City Daily News editions are distributed in large red newspaper racks and in stores, coffee shops, restaurants, schools and major workplaces. The Redwood City Daily News, along with five other Daily News editions, was sold to 


Knight Ridder

 on Feb. 15, 2005. After 
McClatchy's acquisition of Knight Ridder in early 2006, all six Daily News editions, including the Redwood City Daily News, were bundled with the 

San Jose Mercury News
 and sold to 

MediaNews Group
 of 

Denver, Colorado
.


On 
November 12, 
2004, the Redwood City Daily News became one of the first print media outlets in the United States to report late-breaking news of national interest. The trial of 

Scott Peterson
 for the murder of his wife 


Laci

 and their unborn son had taken place at the Redwood City courthouse, and less than an hour after the jury read their verdict the Daily News began circulation of an  extra  edition which announced the result.1



Redwood City residents grab copies of the  Extra  edition with the Peterson verdict.

Fictional character biography



Tenure at Smith's Grove, 1963 - 1978


In November 1963, Loomis receives the six-year-old 


Michael Audrey Myers

 under his care. For an initial six-month-period, Loomis is charged with spending four hours each day in therapy sessions with his patient. The mute and motionless boy had murdered his seventeen-year-old sister 


Judith Myers

 on 

Halloween
 night. Loomis is determined to find out what would cause a boy his age to commit murder. 


On 
May 1, 
1964, Dr. Loomis meets with two superior doctors in the sanitarium's forum chamber. Loomis suggests that his patient be confined in a maximum-security ward located at 












Litchfield, Illinois











. The two doctors brush off Loomis' request declaring that Michael was merely  a catatonic  exhibiting  comatose behavior  who does not react to any of his surroundings. Loomis insists he be taken seriously because he is convinced that his patient's blank behavior is an ingenious cover for his true nature. He also feels that the level of security at Smith's Grove is insufficient. He pleads that Michael be moved immediately to a facility where any possible escape or legalized freedom is impossible. The Smith's Grove superiors decline the doctor's requests and issue an ultimatum that Loomis keep Michael as his patient or he will be looked after by someone else. Loomis knows to his core that no one else can be trusted or even safe around Michael, so he agrees to stay with him. 


For the first eight years of Michael's psychiatric care and treatment, Loomis tries to get any form of response out of him. He finally convinces himself that Michael is truly evil. So, for the following seven years, he tries to keep him in total incarceration.




 Halloween 



Because of failed attempts to rehabilitate and treat his patient, Loomis convinces himself that Michael is indeed a 
psychopath.


Michael turns twenty-one on October 19th. By law, he is to be presented to court on his birthday for trial. The final verdict determines his freedom or further confinement. The trial date is pushed two weeks into the first week of November.


On the rainy night of Monday 
October 30, 
1978, Loomis is accompanied by his friend and medical assistant Nurse Marion Chambers; they are charged with transferring Michael back to his home county for the trial. Loomis reveals to Marion that 
Thorazine will be used before Michael is presented to the judge.  


When the pair reach the gates of the sanitarium, they discover that many patients are wandering around the grounds. Loomis goes to the main gate to telephone the hospital, but Michael appears and nearly attacks Marion while she is waiting in the car. 


Myers escapes from the Illinois state hospital hijacking the car meant for his court date transfer. His plan is to return to his hometown of Haddonfield and locate his last surviving sibling. Driving the 150 miles (241 km) to his destination, he arrives in Haddonfield in time for 

Halloween
. 


Loomis is on Michael's trail for the entire date of October 31st. While en route to Haddonfield, Loomis stops along a rural highway in west central Illinois to call Haddonfield authorities. He has every reason to believe Michael will return home, so he urges that the police watch out for him. 


When the psychiatrist finally arrives in Michael's hometown, he seeks the help of Haddonfield Memorial Cemetery's grave keeper, a man in his sixties named Taylor. The pair discover that the headstone of Judith Myers had been dug up and is missing. This clue is enough to assure that his patient is physically in the city. That afternoon, Loomis enlists the help of Haddonfield's sheriff, Leigh Brackett. The pair later travel to the former Myers residence at 45 Lampkin Lane. Loomis is curious to know if Michael had returned to his childhood home. With the front door being broken into and the decaying carcass of a stray dog being indoors, these two clues reassure Loomis that Michael has indeed come home. Loomis tries convincing Sheriff Brackett that Michael is a human incarnation of pure evil, that he has returned to kill again, and that Haddonfield is not safe on this night until Michael is captured.


While Michael stalks Laurie and her friends, Loomis waits and watches over the house, believing that Michael will return to his home. When he discovers the stolen car, he begins combing the streets where he finds the two children Laurie babysitting running frantically from a house. Loomis investigates and sees Michael attacking Laurie. When she pulls Michael's mask off, he stops to re-apply it, giving Loomis the opportunity to shoot his patient six times, knocking him to and off the balcony of the two-story house. After agreeing with Laurie that Michael was  the boogeyman , Loomis walks over to the balcony and looks down in horror to see that Michael is gone.




 Halloween II 



Picking up directly where the first film leaves off, the sequel continues with Laurie being taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital while Sheriff Brackett accompanies Loomis in his search for Michael. Myers then heads to the hospital to kill Laurie, leaving several bodies in his wake. Dr. Loomis is ordered to leave Haddonfield by the state governor so as to not create panic. His assistant Nurse Marion Chambers has arrived to try convincing Loomis to leave Haddonfield. She also reveals to him one horrifying fact: Michael Myers is the brother of Laurie Strode. After hearing this, Loomis hijacks the police car that is taking him away from Haddonfield using his gun and arrives at the hospital to stop Myers.


Loomis races to Laurie's aid and, once again, fires multiple gun shots to Michael which, naturally, does not stop him. Loomis and Laurie run to a near by operating room where Loomis attempts to destroy Michael with a gun shot to the head. Not realizing his gun is empty, Loomis fires an empty chamber, and Michael angrily stabs him in his stomach. Nevertheless, Loomis recovers, and he and Laurie fill the room with oxygen and ether. As Strode runs away, Loomis stays behind. He tells Michael that  it's time  and proceeds to blow himself up with Michael. This film was supposed to be the end of the franchise, but the ending of Halloween II is later retconned in the later films as a less destructive explosion. 


Surprisingly, Loomis survives, but is horribly burned, sustaining permanent damage to his leg. In 1980, Laurie and Jimmy Lloyd had a daughter named 


Jamie

. Shortly afterwards, it was thought the couple died in a car crash.




 Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers 



On 
October 30, 
1988, Myers, who had been in a 
coma for 10 years, awakens in an ambulance when he hears that he has a 
niece.  Coming upon the carnage resulting from a crash, Dr. Loomis unsuccessfully attempts to alert the police that Michael Myers is now free. He then makes his way back to Haddonfield and Loomis once again pursues him. Loomis goes to the Haddonfield police, who believe him.  While Michael slaughters many officers in the police station, an angry mob turns out from a local bar to help hunt Michael Myers. Loomis works with the new town Sheriff Meeker and the few remaining police officers to help protect Jamie from her uncle. After Loomis is attacked by Michael while helping Jamie to hide after he had found her, he is later seen to have recovered as he witnesses the sheriff, a few of the mob, and state police shoot Michael, seeming to finally kill him. However, after the nightmare appears to have ended, Loomis sees the horrific sight of Jamie after having just stabbed her stepmother, dressed in a clown costume similar to what Michael wore when he killed his sister as a child. Sheriff Meeker stops Loomis just as he raises his gun to Jamie, and seems to go mad by the thought that the evil that drove her uncle has now possessed his niece.




 Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers 



The following year, Myers, who has once again been in a coma despite having escaped the explosion, awakens at a hut and kills the hermit owner, who had taken care of him. He then heads to Haddonfield to kill off his niece Jamie, who is silent and now has developed a telepathic bond between him. He first stalks her surrogate sister Rachel and then manages to kill her a few hours later. He then goes on to kill her friends. Jamie tries to save Rachel's friend Tina who becomes fond and sympathetic for Jamie. Tina, unbeknownst to the danger she is putting herself in realizes that Jamie is on to something when she comes looking for her at a party. Michael shows up and runs down Tina, Jamie and Billy, a friend of Jamie's. Jamie is then saved by Tina as Michael slams his knife down into Tina's chest and kills her. Loomis then arrived at the scene and proposed a deal to Myers: to go to his house and be presented with Jamie Lloyd.  The police and Loomis set a trap for Myers at his house, involving the young niece to sit at the dressing table in Judith Myers's old bedroom. After the police receive calls linking Myers to be somewhere else, they all leave, leaving Loomis to say another famous line,  Now you'll come, won't you, Michael?  Myers goes to his house and meets Loomis who calms him, even tries to reason with the little humanity that is still left in Myers. But, when Loomis reaches to take away Michael's knife, he seriously wounds him. When Loomis awakens, he grabs Jamie and holds her in front of Michael to lure him into a metal link net. Jamie runs and watches as Loomis shoots Michael with a tranquilizer gun and then assaults him with a large piece of wood. Myers is put in jail to be picked up by the 

National Guard
, but is freed by a mysterious Man in Black, who stalks Loomis throughout the movie. The Man in Black also kidnaps Jamie Lloyd the same night from the burning jail. 


Dr. Loomis suffers a stroke immediately after attacking Myers. After that, he retires and moves to a quiet hut on the outskirts of Haddonfield. There he lives a solitary, almost hermit lifestyle, choosing not to interact with other people.




 Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers 



In 1995, the nightmare starts all over again. It is a cold and stormy night when someone knocks on Sam's door. It is Dr. Terence Wynn, his old colleague, who had come to persuade Loomis to return to Smith's Grove. Sam declines. While the two are arguing about that, they hear the voice of Jamie Lloyd on the radio. She is begging Dr. Loomis to help her.


It turns out that Jamie was impregnated by the same cult that kidnapped her in 1989; however, she succeeds in escaping after giving birth to a baby boy. She takes the child with her, and stops at a bus station to call Dr. Loomis. However, Michael tracks her down and kills her, but cannot find the baby.


Jamie has left Steven in the bus stop bathroom. There he is found by Tommy Doyle, the boy whom Laurie Strode was baby-sitting in 1978 who has become a deranged adult bent on destroying Michael Myers.


The following morning Jamie's body is discovered, and Loomis is devastated. He had thought that the last of Michael's bloodline was killed that night, but after being approached by Tommy Doyle who tells him about his discovery of the baby, Loomis knows he has to fight his nemesis one last time in order to save the infant.


During the following day it is revealed that Dr. Terence Wynn, Sam's old colleague is actually the  Man in Black . After this discovery Loomis goes after Wynn, while Tommy Doyle joins forces with Kara Strode, Laurie's cousin whose family has taken residence in the Myers home, in order to protect baby Steven from Michael. They apparently succeed, after a bloody battle in the Smith's Grove sanitarium. 


After  stopping  Michael and Wynn at the end of the movie, Tommy and Kara start their car and as they are about to leave, Loomis informs them that he has to stay behind, because  he has some business to attend to , back in the sanitarium. And as they leave, a loud scream can be heard from the building in which Myers and Loomis were last seen in.


However, in an unreleased cut of the film, after Michael has been stopped by Tommy through the use of runes, Loomis returns to unmask  the shape  only to find a dying Wynn, who mystically passes onto him the Thorn tattoo, making Loomis Michael's watcher.




 Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later 



While Halloween: H20 retcons the previous three films out of continuity, like Halloween 4 it is implied that Loomis survived the explosion at the end of Halloween II. However, as Donald Pleasence had died before the film was made, the character was written to have died sometime before the film began. It is stated in the film that the remaining years of his life, Sam Loomis was cared for by his medical assistant and friend Nurse Marion Chambers. He died while living at Marion s Langdon, Illinois home, never knowing why Michael Myers was so violent and disturbed. For many years, he had hoped to reform his longtime patient, but gave up any genuine treatment when he realized that Myers was filled and influenced by demonic forces, if not enforced by the Devil himself. The septuagenarian Loomis died of natural causes in his comfortable bedchamber and office. His distinguished career as a medical doctor and later a psychiatrist was chronicled on the walls of his room. Key events witnessed by him or having been involved directly or indirectly were in the form of newspaper articles and hospital files. 


An article done by Psychology Review briefly explained Loomis  career:






 

 World renown[ed]authority on deviant psychosocial behavior, sat down with PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW recently to discuss his thirty years of practice. Dr. Loomis gained international fame treating then six year old Michael Myers, the so-called  Halloween Killer.  Myers was only one of the mass murderers that Dr. Loomis has treated over his distinguished career.''

 





On Thursday, October 28, 1998, Nurse Marion Whittington arrives at her Langdon home to find that her front door lamp fixture has been broken. This unusual clue of a possible break-in makes her hesitant to enter her own house alone. She first enlists the help of her teenage next-door neighbor Jimmy Howell, accompanied by his friend Tony Allegre. He telephones the police explaining the situation and they agree to arrive in about fifteen minutes. Jimmy feels the desire to inspect Marion s house himself. Marion warns that all three of them should just wait for the police. Jimmy does inspect her house while Marion and Tony wait outside on the front walk. Jimmy reveals to his concerned neighbor that whoever had been in her house  did a real number  on her office. 


Tired of waiting for the police to finally arrive, Marion enters her house. She briefly inspects the main rooms and then sees for herself what Jimmy had described. Her private office has been broken into and the room is in great disarray. Because electricity is off in her house, she has to make her way in the dark with a flashlight. Even though her file room is in chaos, a black-and-white photograph of her late friend and colleague Dr. Loomis is still intact. This photograph is the only pictorial evidence seen in this Halloween installment of the series  famous protagonist. 


During the prologue credits, the voice of Dr. Loomis is heard as he is explaining the evil that is Michael Myers. Audio clips from 

Halloween
 were initially considered when playing his famous monologue. Instead of the voice of actor Donald Pleasence, sound-alike voice actor Tom Kane provides this voice-over: 


 I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding of even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six year old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil. 




 Halloween (2007) 




Doctor Samuel Loomis is first seen as a young child psychiatrist brought in by ten-year old Michael Myers' school to speak with his mother, Deborah. He recommends the boy gets medical help due to his increasing psychotic behavior (Loomis comes to this conclusion after seeing the various animals Michael tortured and killed). After the triple murder committed by Michael on Halloween, he is put under the care of Dr. Loomis at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. On some days the two talk peacefully, on others Michael expresses extremely horriffic outbursts of emotion. Fifteen years later, Dr. Loomis writes a best-selling book based on Michael's treatment called The Devil's Eyes. On his last day at Smith's Grove, Loomis tells the silent Michael that he has tried but cannot help him anymore. Also telling him that Michael has become something like his best friend. Loomis concludes after Michael's escape he is going to Haddonfield. Once there he enlists the help of Sheriff Lee Brackett, and also buys a gun. Dr. Loomis believes that Michael may have return to finish what he started and murder his little sister, Laurie, who was brought to the adoption agency by Brackett when Michael's mother committed suicide years before. Michael succeeds in tracking Laurie and killing her friends and two police officers. Loomis is alerted of Michael capturing Laurie by Tommy Doyle and Lyndsey Wallace, the children Laurie is babysitting, and sets off to the Myers house. There he confronts Michael as he approaches Laurie, begging Michael to stop, but as Michael ignores him and continues forward, Loomis is left with no choice but to shoot Michael. Loomis rescues Laurie, but Michael soon reawakens to continue the attack on his sister. Loomis again tries to reason with him at which point Michael lets Laurie go and begins to crush Loomis' head, and drags him into the Myers house before continuing his pursuit of Laurie. His fate is unknown.


In the unrated version of the film, when Michael is in pursuit of Laurie through the house, Loomis grabs his foot to try and stop him. Michael shakes him off. This means that Loomis survived the previous attack.


Loomis has a different fate in a workprint version of the film that was leaked before the film's release. In it, Loomis is successful in convincing Michael to let go of Laurie as he is surrounded by police officers, telling Michael he  did the right thing.  After Michael is killed shortly afterwards in a hail of gunfire, we see Loomis crying.


In Rob Zombie's adaptation, Dr. Loomis seems not to have contempt for Michael, and Michael doesn't truly see him as his nemesis. Their relationship with one another is more of a tragic friendship. Loomis does not immediately shoot Michael, but tries to reason with him.

An intrathecal pump is a 
medical device used to delivery very small quantities of medications directly to the 
spinal fluid of a human being.  Medications such as 
baclofen, 
morphine, or 
ziconotide may be delivered in this manner to minimize the side effects often associated with the higher dosages commonly found in oral medications of the same type. 

People with 
spastic diplegia or other forms of 
spasticity, or people in intolerable 
pain and nociception, who cannot tolerate side effects of the higher-dose oral medications of the same medication type, are potential candidates for that medication being administered via an intrathecal pump. In about 5% of patients, the intrathecal Baclofen route has no effect on the nervous system. 


The intrathecal pump consists of a metal 
pump which stores and delivers the medication, and a 
catheter which delivers the medication from the pump to the 
intrathecal space in the spine where the medication takes effect.  Two types of pumps are available: a constant rate pump delivers the medication at a constant rate, and a programmable pump delivers the medication according to a rate determined by a programmable computer program. Currently only 

Medtronic
 manufactures programmable intrathecal pumps in the 








United States







.  


The implantable medical device requires a surgical procedure; a 
surgeon usually performs a trial intrathecal injection or a temporary intrathecal pump to determine if the medication works to begin with, and thus if a pump is appropriate.  A permanent intrathecal pump is then implanted if the patient derives at least 50% improvement in his or her symptoms.  


Possible complications from the implantation (though these are relatively rare now if the surgery is done correctly) include infection and excessive bleeding during the surgery, 
spinal cord injury during the surgery, catheter fracture or migration, and in extremely rare cases, death during the surgery or from 
withdrawals or 
overdose from medication. The pump can also erode the skin which can lead to infection and or dislodging the pump.

South Morava (            )





South Morava (

Serbian
:             /Ju na Morava) is a 
river in the 

Republic of Macedonia
 and 

Serbia
 which represents the shorter headwater of 

Great Morava
. In the XIX century South Morava was known as Bulgarian Morava/            . Today, it's 295 km long, flowing generally in the south to north direction, from 

Macedonian
 border through 

Kosovo
 to 





Central Serbia




, where it meets 

West Morava
 at 
Stala , to create 

Great Morava
.



 Source 


It begins in the mountain of 


Skopska Crna Gora

, in Republic of Macedonia, north of its capital 

Skopje
. Streams of Klju evska reka and Slatinska reka join together to form the river Golema, which, after passing the Macedonian-Serbian border, is known as Bina ka Morava. After 49 km it meets Pre evska Moravica at 

Bujanovac
, and for the remaining of 246 km flows as South Morava.




 Geography 


River belongs to the 





Black Sea




 drainage basin, and its own drainage area is 15,469 km , out of which 1,237 is in 

Bulgaria
 (through its right tributary 
Ni ava). Its average discharge at the mouth is 100 m /s and it is not navigable.


South Morava has a composite valley, which means it consists of series of gorges and depressions in this order: 

Gnjilane
 depression-Kon ulj gorge-

Vranje
 depression-
Grdelica gorge-

Leskovac
 depression-
Ni  depression-

Aleksinac
 depression-
Stala  gorge. After breaking through the last, Stala  gorge, it meets West Morava.





South Morava in 








Moravac







 





In macro-geological point of view, South Morava connects Aegean basin with Pannonian basin. This creates a phenomenon named apparent flow inversion, because it seems that river from one lowland climbs up the mountains and then flows into another lowland. The point connecting these two large geological basins is Grdelica gorge (Serbian: Grdeli ka klisura/                 ), but the bottom of the gorge, where river flows, is much lower than the mountains surrounding it, so river flows normally.


South Morava used to be 318 km long and represented longer and natural (flowing in the same direction) headwater of Great Morava. Causing severe floods in history, meandering river has been shortened by almost 30 km until today, so it became shorter than West Morava. However, West Morava always had bigger discharge.


Areas in southern Serbia where South Morava flows have been almost completely deforested which causes one of the most severe cases of excessive erosion in the Balkans. As a result of this, river brings large amount of materials to Great Morava, filling and elevating its river bed, which helps the huge floods of its daughter river.




 Tributaries 


South Morava has 157 tributaries. Most important left ones are: 



Jablanica


, 

Veternica
, 
Pusta reka and 



Toplica


. Right tributaries are: 
Vrla, 

Vlasina
, 
Ni ava (the longest) and 

Sokobanjska Moravica
.




 Economy 


It has significant potential for electricity production, but this has not been used at all. Huge hydroelectrical system has been constructed in its drainage basin, though (Vlasina- Vrla I-IV power stations).


To a certain extent, its waters are used for irrigation.


The most important role river valley has in transportation. It's the natural route for both railway and highway Belgrade-Skopje-
















Thessaloniki















.

Universities and colleges in Madagascar




University of Antananarivo (

French
: Universite d Antananarivo) is the primary 
public university of 

Madagascar
, located in the capital 

Antananarivo
. 

The school traces its founding to 
December 16, 
1955 and the formation of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Antananarivo. It quickly established itself as the main center for higher education in the country, and was renamed the 






University of Madagascar





 in 1961.  The school opened five more branches in Antsiranana, Fianarantsoa, Toamasina, Toliara, and Mahajanga.


In 
1988 all branches of the system became independent of each other, and the name University of Madagascar was dropped as the school became the University of Antananarivo.

Sailboat types




The Open Ocean Performance Sixty, or simply Open 60, is a class of 
trimaran 









racing yacht








 defined by the 





Ocean Racing Multihull Association




. These boats are specified to be between 59 and 60 feet long and are intended to compete in a variety of events.

Other prominent restrictions on an Open 60:1



 LOA = 17.88m - 18.28m


 Bowsprit no greater than 2.75m


 Mast Height above water no greater than 30.3m


 Maximum mast chord = 850mm


 Limited to 15 new sails every 2 years.




However, there are few other regulations on the design or materials that can be used for the boat. Due to this, the design of Open 60s is an area of fierce competition and innovation. Custom-designed boats are often built with combination 
carbon fiber and 






Kevlar





 
sails, which have the desired properties of both lightness and rigidity.2


Due to their innovative construction and mutlihull design, ORMA 60 trimarians can reach speeds of nearly 45 miles per hour, far faster than the quickest sailing monohull.2

Merry Marvel Marching Society (often referred to by the abbreviation  M.M.M.S. ) was a 
fan club for 

Marvel Comics
 started by Marvel editor 

Stan Lee
 and/or Marvel publisher 

Martin Goodman
 in 1964.


History



Creation


Following teaser promotion in Marvel comic books cover-dated November 1964, Marvel Comics introduced the company's in-house fan club, the Merry Marvel Marching Society, in its February 1965 comics, released in the fall of 1964. Generally abbreviated as  the M.M.M.S . the club offered readers a $1 membership kit that initially included a welcoming letter; a membership card; a one-sided, 

33 1/3 rpm
 record,  The Voices of Marvel ; a scratch pad; a sticker; a pinback button; and a certificate.1 The company offered permutations of this kit, plus additional promotional merchandise such as posters and sweatshirts, through comics cover-dated October 1969.2


As author Ronin Ro described:





 

 Stan made up cards and had production people 








Sol Brodsky







 and 

Marie Severin
 help create a pin, eight stickers prominently featuring the heroes,  a nutty new notepad,  a minibook, a pencil, a certificate, and a membership card. Stan wanted his 
bullpen to join him in a special recording he'd include in the $1 membership kit. Most of the bullpen was willing, except for 

Ditko
 .3

 







Demise


The M.M.M.S. was absorbed into the subsequent Marvel fan club, 










Marvelmania International









, in 1969. This second club lasted until 1971. A third official Marvel Comics fan club, 










FOOM









 (Friends of 'Ol Marvel) followed from 1973 to 1976.





Ranks


The ranks of M.M.M.S. membership, all identified by three letter abbreviations (such as Q.N.S. for  Quite 'Nuff Sayer  to F.F.F. for  Fearless Front-Facer ) were invented by young comics fan, and Jack Kirby-confidante 


Mark Evanier

. 


The society was a great success, with  Fabulous  
Flo Steinberg remarking that they  were working seven days a week just opening these envelopes  (containing the subscription fee).4 Soon, the club offered a range of other money-spinning products, including:


 a six-foot  life-size, full-color Spidey pin-up  made from a striking Ditko Spider-Man drawing, a $1.50 T-shirt with a sinister-looking Ditko-drawn 
Dr. Strange, a 














Thing













 drawing by Jack [Kirby] on  Official Swinging' Stationary,  and a Jack-drawn 



Fantastic Four


 family portrait T-shirt. 5






In popular culture


The character of 


Hiro Nakamura

 on 

Heroes
 is reported to be an M.M.M.S. member in the episode  
Don't Look Back .

The Marvel Action Hour





The Marvel Action Hour was a 
syndicated television block from 





Marvel Productions




 featuring animated adaptions of 

Marvel comic book
 heroes the 



Fantastic Four


 and 
Iron Man. The Marvel Action Hour debuted in 
1994. The Marvel Action Hour lasted two seasons before being cancelled.



Format


The first half of the hour was an episode of 

Iron Man
; the second half an episode of 

Fantastic Four
 (many episodes of which were direct recreations of episodes from the 

original 1960s series
). During the first season, 

Stan Lee
 was featured speaking before each show about characters in the following episode and what had inspired him to create them.


The show underwent a notable modification when broadcast on the 

BBC
 in the 











United Kingdom










; because the BBC does not feature commercial breaks, the two shows that made up the Marvel Action Hour would actually only have totaled about forty minutes, and so episodes of the 1980s 
Incredible Hulk series were added between the two original shows to bring the whole bundle up to the promised hour in length.



Season 2


Both the Fantastic Four and Iron Man were radically retooled for the second seasons, sporting new opening sequences, improved animation, and more mature writing, though noticeably missing the introductions by Stan Lee. 


In some markets, the second season was known as 

Marvel Action Universe
 (with the addition of 

Biker Mice from Mars
), which was the name of a previous syndicated programming block in the late 1980s.

Judson Spence (born 
29 April 
1965, 

Pascagoula
, 

Mississippi
) is an 








American







 
pop music singer, 
songwriter, 
multi-instrumentalist based in 

Nashville
, 





Tennessee




. He originally gained fame when he released his 
eponymously titled debut 
solo effort on 

Atlantic Records
 in 1988. The 
album was 
produced by Monroe Jones and 






David Tickle





, and executive produced by future 
Interscope founder 


Jimmy Iovine

.


Although he had a top 30 
hit with  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah  in 1988 and also had a minor hit with  Drift Away  from 

The Wonder Years
 
soundtrack, Spence was dropped from Atlantic before completing his second album in 1991.


After several years of struggle, Spence's composition  The Power  was covered by both 

Amy Grant
 and 


Cher

 and was also used for a national 
Century 21 advertising campaign. Subsequently, he recorded the indie release  painfathjoy  in 1995. 


He performed with 










Trisha Yearwood









 on the 

Oscar
 nominated song  How Do I Live Without You  in 1997 and sang live with her on the 
American Music Awards, 

The Tonight Show
, The Oscars, and the 

CMA
 Awards.


In 1999, he released his third solo album in Japan entitled I Guess I Love It before his 
record label, Pioneer Music Group closed its doors. That album was produced by former Eagle 



Bernie Leadon


. In 2000, he toured with Trisha Yearwood. The following year, 


Wynonna Judd

 cut Judson s song,  New Day Dawning  and it became the title track to her album.


In 2003, Spence released two albums: The Velvet Kitten Sessions which was a mainstream collection, and Opus Dei which was a religious themed effort.


In 2007, Spence was to release his latest album on 
Universal South until the label cut its roster in late January. The current status of this release is unknown.

The SS Home was a steam 
packet ship built in 
1836 and sunk in 
1837 and commanded by Captain Carleton White.

The Home was built for Mr. James B. Allaire, of 

New York City
, a ship of 537 tons (487,158 
kg), 220 feet (67 
m) long and with a beam of 22 feet (7 m), propelled by two paddle-wheels mounted amidship. Like other ships of its day, the Home had masts, sails, and rigging as well. 


On Saturday, 
October 7, 
1837 the Home set out from New York City bound for 

Charleston
, 









South Carolina








 with about 90 passengers and 40 crew on board. The Home had only made two voyages to Charleston prior to this voyage. The Home struck a sandbar off the 

New Jersey
 coast. Unaware of the extent of the damage, her captain proceeded on schedule to Charleston when it encountered the 

1837 Racer's Storm
 and started taking on water as she rounded 








Cape Hatteras







. She was put aground to ride out the developing storm. Before rescue operations could be effected the next day, the Home was torn to pieces by the surf and 90 lives were lost.


The Home had been originally constructed for river trade, but converted into a passenger liner. The ship s interior was paneled in deep 
mahogany and cherry wood with skylights, 
saloons, and luxurious passenger quarters.


A total of 

$
115,000 had been spent converting the Home for ocean voyages but it was equipped with only three 






lifeboat





s and two life preservers. The Home was insured for only $35,000.



Notable passengers





The Hardy Croom family of 

Tallahassee
, 

Florida
. Hardy Croom established one of Tallahassee's premier 
cotton plantations called 





Goodwood Plantation




. 














Oliver H. Prince










 and wife Mary Prince. Oliver was on the Board of Trustees of the 

University of Georgia
 and had been a 
United States Senator from 

Georgia
 as well as 
Georgia State Senator.

Quentin Richard Stephen Letts (born 
6 February 
1963) is a 











British










 journalist, writing for 

The Daily Telegraph
, 

Daily Mail
, 
Mail on Sunday, and 

New Statesman
, and previously for 

The Times
.


Early life


He is the son of Richard Letts and Jocelyn Elizabeth Letts (nee Adami).  His older sister, Melinda, is a successful accredited executive coach who was awarded an 






OBE





 in 2003.  He was educated at 
Haileybury and Imperial Service College, Bellarmine College, Kentucky (now 

Bellarmine University

Trinity College, Dublin
 where he edited a number of publications, including the satirical 
Piranha, and studied Medieval and Renaissance Literature (1982-86), and 





Jesus College, Cambridge




, taking a Diploma in Classical Archaeology. 




Career


Letts has written for a number of British newspapers since beginning his journalistic career in 1987.  His first post was with the Peterborough gossip column in the 
Daily Telegraph. He is the person behind the 

Daily Mail
's 
Clement Crabbe column and is also the paper's theatre critic and political sketchwriter. He lists his recreations, in 









Who's Who








, as  gossip  and  character 
defenestration .  A regular victim of the latter trait is the 
Speaker of the British House of Commons 
Michael Martin whom he famously nicknamed  Gorbals Mick , a reference to the 
Gorbals area of Glasgow, despite the fact that Michael Martin does not come from the Gorbals. Letts is particularly right wing in his views and in a list of 50 people who ruined Britain he castigated the instigator of comprehensive schooling, Tony Blair, Princess Diana and John NcEnroe amonst others

Cooking Mama: Cook Off (Cooking Mama: Minna to Issho ni Ory ri Taikai!) is a 
video game for the 

Wii
 that was developed by 







Office Create






 and published by 
Taito in Japan, 

Majesco Entertainment
 in North America, and 




505 Games



 in Europe and Australia. It is the sequel to the 

Nintendo DS
 game 





Cooking Mama




. The game was released in Japan on 
February 8 
2007 and in North America on 
March 20 
2007. In Europe (other than in Germany), it was released on 
May 11 
2007, with an Australian release closely following on 
May 17 
2007. The Wii sequel to this game, Cooking Mama: World Kitchen is to be released in the US in October 2008.



Gameplay


Cook Off is a cooking 
simulation, where dishes are prepared by completing a series of short 
minigames.  Each minigame represents a step in the meal preparation process, with a complete dish requiring anywhere from two to more than a dozen such steps. Players use the 

Wii Remote
 to mimic real-life cooking movements such as rolling, slicing, chopping, and stirring. For example, during a minigame involving grinding up raw beef, the player might be instructed to move the Wii Remote in a circular motion as if grasping the handle of a 
meat grinder. Both the Wii Remote's motion sensing and positional/pointing capabilities may be utilized, depending on the minigame.


Cook Off features a total of 55 different 
recipes using over 300 different ingredients.  Although the initial number of accessible recipes is relatively small, new recipes are unlocked as previous recipes are successfully completed. Available recipes are displayed in a 
cookbook, along with a small 
national flag next to each, indicating each recipe's country of origin.  While Cook Off includes fewer total recipes than Cooking Mama, recipes have a greater average number of steps and/or ingredients.


The dishes come from 10 different countries: 

France
, the 








United States







, the 











United Kingdom










, 



Spain


, 
Japan, 



Italy


, 
China, 

Germany
, 

India
 and 

Russia
.



Scoring


As with the previous title, the player's performance is rated based on how quickly and accurately he or she can perform the various tasks. The player is awarded a score after each minigame, with the score factoring in both successful completion and the amount of time remaining. After the dish is completed, a medal is awarded based upon the average performance in each of the minigames. Unlike the original Cooking Mama, the best total score is stored as a high score, so that players can continue to try and surpass their previous performance on a dish even after winning a 
gold medal.


If players complete an entire minigame without making a mistake, or otherwise perform a given sub-task perfectly, they may be awarded a small score bonus for their skill.




New modes


The primary new play mode (as compared to the original Cooking Mama) is the Friends and Food of the World mode.  In this mode, players challenge fictitious friends from various foreign countries to make their favorite recipes.  Each friend has different ethnic or national recipes which they specialize in; in total, the game includes recipes from 10 different countries.  As friends rarely make mistakes, players must be proficient at creating a given dish if they hope to win.  Defeating the opponent rewards the player with a piece of cooking gear or utensil (often adorned in gold), while failure earns a 
consolation prize with which to decorate the kitchen.


The game also includes a new two-player mode, titled Friends and Food, in which players compete head-to-head preparing the same recipe.  Both players play simultaneously (each with their own Wii Remote) using a split-screen view.  After the dish is completed, the total scores of both players are compared and one is declared the winner.





Reception


Prior to the title's release, early press generated a certain level of excitement, with 

Wired News
 proclaiming Cooking Mama: Cook Off the  Best Game of CES 2007 .1 However, after playing the finished product, several reviews noted that the game was not nearly as responsive or intuitive as its predecessor. According to reviewers, a simple action with the Wii Remote can be difficult to perform successfully, leading to a frustrating experience.2 While the game was reported to still be fun, the lack of 
tactile feedback and several nagging control issues detract from the overall enjoyment.3 As a result, 







IGN






 awarded the title only 5.8 out of 10, while Japanese gaming magazine 










Famitsu









 scored the game 29 out of 40.


In its May 2007 issue, 

Electronic Gaming Monthly
's three editors gave the game marks of 7.0/10, 7.5/10 and 8.0/10, earning it an overall rating of  Good .


As of October 2007, Cooking Mama: Cook Off has an average 

Game Rankings
 and 

Metacritic
 rating of 
62%.


In response to 
Alex Navarro's Gamespot review, in which he had given the game a 5.5 (Mediocre) rating, Majesco personally sent a letter, in which they sarcastically thank him, along with making references to the game's sales. It has been widely circulated around the internet. 4

He and his brother Gary branched out into acting in 1990, both of them appearing in the British film 

The Krays
 in which they played the notorious gangster twins, 


Ronald and Reginald Kray

. Their performances received a great deal of critical acclaim.  


Since The Krays, Martin Kemp has been in the public eye more than his brother. He moved to 
Los Angeles in the early 1990s and made appearances in television series such as 

The Outer Limits

Hollywood films such as  (1992) and

brain tumor. He then resumed his acting career in 1998 when he made guest appearance in the 

ITV

Personal life


Martin Kemp has been married to 
Shirlie Holliman since 1988. Holliman is a former back up singer of the group 
Wham! and one-half of the 1980s pop duo 

Pepsi   Shirlie
. The couple have a son and daughter together. Martin Kemp is also patron of the UK and Ireland charity, The Encephalitis Society, and at the time of becoming patron confirmed that he had controlled 
epilepsy since the 1990s, as a result of having two brain tumours. The Society is the only resource in the world that provides information globally on the disease and its consequences. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain usually as a result of infection or an inappropriate auto immune response.  Following the tumours, Kemp had a protective metal plate implanted over his brain under the scalp.  It is unnoticeable but not undetectable - during an appearance on the 

Frank Skinner
 Show in 2002, Kemp jokingly remarked that he could never slip quietly through metal detectors at airports, as the plate would set the alarm off.

William Weightman Valk (born 
December 12, 
1806 in 

Charleston, South Carolina
; died 
September 20, 
1879 in 
Washington, DC) was a soldier in the 

American Civil War
 and a 
U.S. Congressman.

In 1830, Valk earned a degree in medicine, graduating from the 
University of South Carolina at Columbia in 1830.  He opened a practice in 

Connecticut
. He joined the Navy during the 
Mexican-American War and became chief surgeon on the 



USS Constellation''


.  Valk joined the 

California
 
Gold Rush in 1849 and, upon failure, opened a practice on 







Long Island






. From March 4, 1855 to March 3, 1857, Valk served in  New York's 1st District in the United States House of Representatives.


Finally settled in 
Flushing, New York, and continued the practice of medicine until elected to Congress. He was elected as a candidate serving in New York's 1st District, as a member of the 
American Party to the Thirty-fourth Congress (
March 4, 
1855-
March 3, 
1857). He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection.   Upon the breakout of Civil War, he volunteered as chief surgeon of the 



2nd Maryland (USA) Volunteer Infantry


 of the 
Union Army. He later became a pension office clerk in 
Washington DC.  He was interred in Flushing Cemetery.

The Transitions Championship, formally the PODS Championship and Tampa Bay Classic, is a men's professional 
golf tournament on the 











PGA Tour










, and is played annually at 
Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club in 

Palm Harbor, Florida
. The tournament is the 11th event on the 











2008 PGA Tour Schedule










 and is part of the Tour's 


FedEx Cup competition

.


History


The tournament was founded in 2000 as the Tampa Bay Classic. It was originally an alternate event played the same week as the 





Presidents Cup




 in 2000, and the same week as the 

WGC-American Express Championship
 in 2002. It was supposed to be played the same week as the WGC-American Express Championship on September 13-16, 2001. However, the 

terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001
 forced the cancelations of both tournaments.


From 2003 to 2006, the Tampa Bay event had a slot in the schedule to itself as the last full-field event before the 
Tour Championship. The 

Chrysler Corporation
 was the title sponsor.


Since 2007, the Tampa Bay event has been played in March. For a time the tournament was without a title sponsor, leading to speculation on its fate beyond 2007. Then, on January 24, 2007, tournament officials and the PGA Tour announced a sponsorship agreement with the 
PODS Group. Located in 

Clearwater

Plyskiv (

Ukrainian
:        , 

Russian
:      o ) is a village in 
Vinnytsia Oblast, 

Ukraine
. The population is 1,439 (
2006).


 Pliskov History 



Pliskov was first mentioned in Polish archive documents in 1552.  Pliskov was settled on the banks of the river Rosen, by the German Jews who were given permission by the Polish King to settle in the Polish Kingdom (
Rzeczpospolita). In 1795, this place became part of the 

Russian Empire
 ( after the partition of Poland between 

Russia
, 

Prussia
 and 

Austria-Hungary
), and was already named Pliskovo. The name  Pliskov  originates from the bird Pliska (      ) that lived in the woods around Pliskov.


Before the October 1917 Revolution, there were three 
synagogues, a bath house by the river, a cemetery, two drug stores, two hotels, four smithies, four mills, three water mills and a steam mill, two barber shop, a diner, and many stores and workshops inside the shtetel center. Once a week a big market was arranged at the Market Place, where peasants sold their goods and bought the goods that the Jewish shop owners and craftsmen were selling.


There were 220 houses in Pliskov, in which, according to the first census conducted in 1892, lived 1,320 Jews. The houses varied. Wealthy families lived in good quality brick houses with tin roofs. Poorer families lived in houses with thatched roofs. Pliskov was famous for its mineral spring named  Brover . In the wintertime it did not freeze, and in the summertime, even during the hottest days, water did not disappear and was always cold. All year round the water-carrier delivered water from this spring to the customers who paid a small fee for the service.


For 300 years  Pliskov was a small Jewish town (
shtetl), first in 

Poland
 than 

Russia
, 
USSR and finally destroyed by 

Nazi Germany
 and local 
Nazi collaborators during 







World War II






 . The Jewish population of Pliskov and surrounding shtetls, such as 
Pogrebishche,








Justingrad







, 
Lipovets, 
Shpicentsy, 
Zhivotovo, 
Dashev and 
Tetiev were often victims of 
Pogroms, assaults and persecution which took place from the days when these towns came into being and until their complete disappearance after World War II (1939-1945). 
Khmelnickiy s Cossacks (1648-1654), 
Gaydamaks  (1736-1768), 
Pogroms of late 19th and early 20th century (most notable Pliskov Pogrom of 1914), 
Russian Revolution and 

Russian Civil War
 (1917-1921) and finally 







World War II






 are a few of the most notable events which made Jewish life difficult in Pliskov and in 


Eastern Europe

 in general. There were pogroms organized by Petlura s and Denikin s gangs. Also pogroms and massacres of Jews in 1918-1919 organized by the 
White Armies as well as detachments of 




Red Army



 soldiers. In the summer of 1920, Red Cossacks of the Budenniy Army also robbed Jews.  All of these pogroms, robberies and murders forced many 
Jews to seek refuge in the 








United States







.


Until 1929, there were private businesses in Pliskov, but in 1930 they were confiscated and all craftsmen were forced to work in Artels. In 1926, all Jewish schools (
Cheders) were closed and the study of the Torah and the 

Hebrew language
 were prohibited. The only school which taught in 
Yiddish was closed in 1936. Before 1930, many families and most of the younger generation of Jews had already moved to such big cities as 

Kiev
, 

Moscow
, 

Leningrad
, 
Kharkov.


On July 22, 1941, Pliskov was occupied by the German Army. All of the Jews of Pliskov stayed in the town, and most of the blame fell upon the Stalin regime. Before the war, when the treaty with Hitler was signed, the newspapers and radio discontinued all of the reports about the Nazi treatment of the Jews. This is the main reason the Pliskov Jews stayed in town, scared and waiting to see how the fascists treated the Jews. A German--Fric Nudel--was the Commandant of Pliskov, and he appointed an Ukrainian named Ivanko to be Head of Pliskov. Ivanko announced that all Jews of Pliskov would be deprived of all their rights and personal property, and every Ukrainian could take possession of that property except for gold, platinum, silver and other valuables which would pass to Germany. Fric Nudel formed a Ukrainian Police Force. The chief of police was a known criminal named Chirsky, who still lives in Australia after escaping from Pliskov in 1944. On October 22, 1941, Head of Gendarmery Shuster, his assistant Kinkel, officers Benkel and Kushner, together with Fric Nudel executed all of Pliskov's Jews. Together with the German fascists, the Ukrainian police took an active part in this massacre. Some of the Jews were able to hide in a basements and attics of gentile neighbors who were willing to risks their lives by doing so. Not that many people were willing to so. Some of the Jews of Pliskov were able to survive like that until 1944. But none of them were there to see the liberation of Pliskov by the Soviet Army later that year.  After the War, none of the surviving Jews who fought in Soviet Army or left the town before the War returned to Pliskov. 300 years of the Jewish town of Pliskov was erased in a matter of one year.  A village named Pliskov is located in the same place, but the shtetel of Pliskov is gone. Those who survived the Holocaust of 1941-1945 have moved to many countries.  The Jews of Pliskov now live in 

Israel
, 

Australia
, 
USA, 

Germany
,  and the big cities of the Former Soviet Union Republics.




 Pliskov in America 



Pliskovers are the descendants of the shtetel of Pliskov.  Many of the former residents of Pliskov relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There is an organization in Pittsburgh called the Pliskover Cemetery Association. Former residents of Pliskov started an organization to help each other and people still in Pliskov. Founded in 1908, its first name was Pliskover Free Loan Association, where interest free loans were given to needy members/Pliskovers. In 1917, they bought some land in Coraopolis, to serve as a private cemetery. By joining the organization and paying dues, the member has a plot where they can be buried. Free loans are no longer given out, that is why the name changed to Pliskover Cemetery Association. The cemetery is still open to members and membership, and is the resting place for some of the former residents of the shtetel of Pliskov and their family members.

For other persons named John McGuinness, see 
John McGuinness (disambiguation).
John McGuinness (born 
16 April 
1972 in 

Morecambe
) is an 

English
 motorcycle racer. McGuinness races for the HM Plant Honda team in road races like the 
Isle of Man TT and the 
North West 200, and on the short tracks in the British Superstock series.


McGuinness is one of the best riders on the 37.73-mile 








Mountain Course







 on the Isle of Man, having achieved 23 podiums, including 14 wins. He also holds the outright lap record on the circuit.



TT 2006 proved to be the best ever for McGuinness. He won three races (Senior, Superbike and Supersport) and he lowered the outright lap record four times during the festival. This all started in the TT Superbike race on June 3 2006, recording 17:42.53 from a standing start, then 17:41.71 on the second lap. His record lap stood at 127.933 mph to take in the 37.73 miles of the Mountain course, before another record-breaking performance in the 
Senior TT race on 
9th June. John set a time of 17:39.95 from a standing start (already 1.76 seconds faster than a racing lap) and then blitzed the course in 17:29.26, 10.69 seconds faster than his opening lap and at an average speed of 129.451 mph. 



TT 2007 was also a great year with McGuinness taking wins in the Superbike TT and the Senior TT with lap and race records in both, the Senior lap record of 17:21.99 averaging 130.35 mph not only the outright lap record but the first to break the 130 mph barrier.


The 
2008 Isle of Man TT saw McGuinness struggle with reliability problems with his bikes, but did manage to pick up his 14th career win on the island, in the 
Senior TT. This win moves him alongside 

Mike Hailwood
 as the joint second-placed rider with most wins.


He has also finished on the podium at the 
Macau Grand Prix.

Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm, released in Japan as Atelier Iris: Grand Fantasm (                  , Irisu no Atorie Guran Fantazumu) is a 
console role-playing game developed by Japanese developer 

Gust
 for the 

PlayStation 2
.


The game was released in Japan on 
June 29, 
2006, in the US on 
May 29, 
2007 and is in Europe on 
July 27, 
2007.



Gameplay


Players guide their party of adventurers through the town of Zey Meruze which acts as a central hub and five different areas called Alterworlds, acting as the dungeons. In order to progress through the game, players must undertake quests which are obtained from the Raiders Guild in town. This system is a departure from previous games in the series, and allows players to undertake multiple tasks at once and to choose their own way through the game to an extent. As tasks are completed, the party gains guild points. Once enough guild points are gained for the next rank, the next part of the main plotline follows, before more side-quests in the form of tasks are made available.1


When the party moves from the town to an alterworld to complete a task, a timer starts counting down. If the task is not completed before the timer runs out, the party is safely removed from the alterworld and must attempt the quest again. and again. and sometimes, again.



Alchemy forms an important aspect of the story and gameplay, as with the other Atelier Iris games. Items are combined in the party's workshop by the character Iris, forming new items and equipment. This system is used to create attack items for combat, healing items, status attack or restoration items, weapons and armor for characters to equip and various other items.


The game also features some 
side story characteristics, that allow Edge to engage in  conversations with some of the townspeople upon the completion of certain quests. These conversations provide additional details about the townspeople.




Playable Characters


Unlike previous games in the series, the maximum number of playable characters is 3. However to compensate for the fewer number of characters, once a certain point is reached in the game, Edge and Nell can equip various 'Blades' which can change their stats and skills.

Game Rankings
.2




GameSpy
's review in particular criticised the game for a number of reasons including the combat system, storyline and generic characters. The review concluded  the series is stagnating in gameplay that was obtusely old-fashioned ten years ago .4 

1UP.com
's review was also scathing, describing the gameplay as linear, the dungeon timer as poor game design and the graphics as being lower quality than the original game -  the character sprites are just a few degrees away from looking like 





Playmobil




 figures .3  


Some reviews were favourable, in particular those from 

GameZone
 and 

RPGFan
. GameZone described the game's characters as likeable and the dialogue as well-voiced, though considered the game to be driven by quests rather than the story. The game's music was highly praised:  next to the gameplay, this is the number-one reason to play AI3.  The review described the game as lacking innovation but as  an inspired, enamoring RPG that grabs its players in a way that few RPGs have. 5

Binomial name



Diplocarpon rosae
































Diplocarpon rosae is a 
fungus that causes the 
rose disease Black Spot.1
Because it was observed by people of various countries around the same time (around 
1830), the nomenclature for the fungus varied with about 25 different names. The asexual stage is now known to be 
Marssonina rosae while the sexual and most common stage is known as Diplocarpon rosae.


Diplocarpon rosae over seasons as 
mycelia, 
ascospores, and 
conidia in infected leaves and canes. In the spring during moist, humid conditions, ascospores and conidia are wind-borne and rain splashed to newly emerging leaf tissue. Upon infection, disease progresses from the lowest leaves upward causing defoliation and black spots on leaves. 



Diagnosis


The black spots are circular with a perforated edge, and reach a diameter of 14mm. Badly affected plants, however, will not show the circular pattening, as they combine to cause a large black mass. The common treatment of the disease, is to remove the affected leaves, and spraying with anti-fungal solutions. Some 
stems of the roses may become affected if untreated, and will cause progressive weakening of the plant.




Treatment


It is usually recommended to remove the plant, as it will not yield well, and will slow the spreading of the disease.  Removing fallen leaves helps to avoid the infection.  Fungicides, such as mancozeb, chlorothalonil, flutriafol, penconazole, or a copper based product, applied upon new leaf emergence or first appearance of black spot can be used to control the disease.  Alternatively, if a more natural and nontoxic approach is desired, diluted 
neem oil is effective both against black spot and as an insecticide against 
aphids.  Several sprays may be required to keep the disease under control during the growing season.

John Henry Luers from Who-When-What Book, 1900



John Henry Luers (
September 29, 
1819 - 
June 29, 
1871 was nominated first Bishop of 
Fort Wayne, Indiana, and consecrated in 

Cincinnati, Ohio
, 10 January, 1858. 

He was born near 
Munster, 
Westphalia, and emigrated to 








America







 in 1831. He was ordained priest in 
Cincinnati on 
November 11, 
1846. Entering upon the administration of the new diocese, he devoted himself zealously to the founding of new parishes and missions, provided a home for the orphans, and built a cathedral. 


In June, 1871, during a vacancy of the 
See of 

Cleveland, Ohio
, he was called to that city to confer ordination on a number of seminarians. After the function, on his way to the train, he suffered an 
apoplectic stroke and fell dead. At the time of Bishop Luers' death there were, in the Diocese of Fort Wayne, 69 priests, 75 churches, 10 chapels, 1 hospital, 1 orphan asylum, 1 college, 11 academies for girls, 40 parochial schools, and a 


Catholic

 population estimated at 50,000.


The 
Franciscan order founded 




Bishop Luers High School



 in 1958 in Fort Wayne, where it currently enrolls around 550 students.

Nise-e (  ), or  likeness pictures,  were a style of portraiture popular in the courts and intellectual circles of Japan's 



Kamakura period


. Court officials, poets and intellectuals, and other prominent figures, would be portrayed in such a way as to capture the essence and personality of the individual in a very few brushstrokes. The term ni-gao (  ) was often applied to those nise-e portraits which were painted particularly realistically.

France 1969



The removal of five missile boats from the French shipyard of 





Cherbourg




 which were paid for by the Israeli government but were not delivered due to the French arms embargo in 
1969.1 Mistakenly people tend to refer the escape of the 5 boats for Cherbourg Harbor at the Christmas eve 1969 to 

Mossad
.  This affair had no relation to Mossad.


The plot to take the boats was made by Israeli Navy and Rear   Admiral, Retired Mordechi (Nick name Mokka) Limon who was the head of IDF mission in Paris France.


The boats were transferred to a straw company called Starboat. This company was Norwegian company for Oil Drills. The idea was of Mokka and he was aided by the connections of Milla Brenner, retired Naval officer Commander in Rank that had the Merchant Marin company for fruits freight ships in Israel.


The boats were sold and transferred legally by the government of Israel to the straw company by the approval of 
Michel Debre, the 







French minister of defense






.


The crew on board of the ships was 






Israeli Navy





. They kept routine of short sails to the 
Atlantic. Also they started to operate engines at nights in full noise to make a routine of noise in Cherbourg. The local police came and that issue continued. So the locals gave up on that and it became normal. Prior to escape, small groups of reinforcement navy crew started to come officers ratings and sailors. They purchased food in local stores in small groups to prevent attention, since Cherbourg was a small town and Israeli Navy guys were known there.


Next they asked help from 



ZIM navigation company


 Europe Lines for fueling. This was given to them by Edmond Wilhelm Brillant, a retired navy officer. He designed M.V. Lea and M.V. Netanya to provide fuel at the Biscay (Netanya Backup) and Gibralter (Lea).


Commanding officer of escape was Captain Hadar Kimhi, Vice Commander Ezra Kedm Krishinski (Nick name  Karish  which is Shark). The boats are INS Suffa (Storm) skipper Lt. Ronna Arie, INS (Israeli Navy Ship) Ga ash (Volcano) skipper Lt. Gil Koren, INS Herev (Sward) skipper Lt. Commander Gaddi Ben Zeev, INS Hanit (Spear) skipper Lt. Commander Haim Shaked, INS Hetz (Arrow) skipper Commander Moshe Tabak. The rest is history. (Boats names for oil drill company Starboat 1,2,3,4,5).

Yemen
, held in 
extrajudicial detention in the 








United States







 








Guantanamo Bay Naval Base

Ahmed's Guantanamo detainee ID number is 683.
American 
intelligence analysts estimate that Ahmed was born in 1977, in 

Aden
, Yemen.


Combatant Status Review Tribunal







Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the 
Geneva Conventions to captives from 
the war on terror.  This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct 
competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of 
prisoner of war status.


Subsequently the 

Department of Defense
 instituted the 












Combatant Status Review Tribunal











s.  The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an 
enemy combatant.



Allegations

 
During the winter and spring of 2005 the Department of Defense complied with a 
Freedom of Information Act request, and released five files that contained 507 memoranda which each summarized the allegations against a single detainee. These memos, entitled  Summary of Evidence  were prepared for the detainee's Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The detainee's names and ID numbers were redacted from all but one of these memos, when they were first released in 2005. But some of them contain notations in pen. 169 of the memos bear a hand-written notation specifying the detainee's ID number. One of the memos had a notation specifying Fayad Yahya Ahmed's detainee ID.5 
The allegations Ahmed faced, during his Tribunal, were: 




a. The detainee is a supporter of 
al Qaida:

:#The detainee is a '########## who traveled to 

Pakistan
 via 

Yemen
; 

Karachi
, 

Pakistan
 and finally to 

Lahore
, 

Pakistan
 prior to 11 September 2001.



The detainee was recruited by a member of the 
Jama'at al-Tabligh  [
sic]. 


Jama'at al-Tabligh  [
sic], a Pakistani based Islamic missionary organization is being used as a cover to mask travel and activities of terrorists including members of al-Qaida.


The detainee lived in '######### with other Yemeni students.


The detainee was arrested at '######## during a raid by the Pakistani police.


The detainee was transferred to a prison in 

Kabul
, 

Afghanistan
.






Tribunal



Ahmed chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.6




Evidence not available



Fayed Yahya Ahmed s Tribunal started with his Tribunal s President informed him that an exculpatory document he requested would not be provided to him, because it was  not reasonably available :
 The Tribunal President, referring to Exhibit D-A, informed the Detainee that an unclassified version of the document he requested on Jama'at al-Tabligh could not be found and was therefore considered to be not reasonably available. 






Response to the allegations







In response to the first allegation Ahmed asked how traveling to from Yemen to Lahore showed that he was tied to al Qaeda.  He said that his interrogator and investigator had recently told him that he was innocent, had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that he should be released.  He said he had no idea where the six allegations he faced during his Tribunal came from.


In response to the allegation that he was recruited by a member of Jama at al-Tablighi  [
sic] he talked about his understanding of the meaning  recruit .  He said that if the definition of being  recruited  was that he saw the Tablighi pilgrims at the mosque.  He said that everyone sometimes sat with the Tablighi pilgrims.






|

| Personal Representative:|| Jama 'at al-Tabligh, a Pakistani based Islamic missionary organization is being used as a cover to mask travel and activities of terrorists including members of al Qaida. 
|-
| Detainee: || Before this they told me that al-Tabligh are not from al Qaida, is that true? 
|-
| Personal Representative:' || We searched for a document to show that there is a connection but did not find one. 
|-
| Detainee: || The al-Tabligh are not from al Qaida. In this point, basically you are saying Jama'at al-Tabligh is used as a cover for al Qaida and terrorist activities. So basically you are saying that Jama'at al-Tabligh are al Qaida. 
|-
| Personal Representative:' || It is up to him to tell us in his story, what connection if any, he has Jama'at al-Tabligh. 
|-
| Detainee: || Is it true that you are saying that I am with Jama'at al-Tabligh and Jama'at al-Tabligh are used as a cover for al Qaida. Is that what they are trying to say? 
|-
| Personal Representative:' || I can read him the accusation again if he would like. 
|}



In response to the allegation that he lived in Issa's guest house with other Yemenis Ahmed asked for an explanation of how living with people from his own country made him a member of al Qaeda.


 This is like a game. All those six points that were given to me, supposed to be supporting that I am an al Qaida supporter, are all false. There is international law that goes against someone living outside their country. If going to travel from country to another, who am I going to live with? Of course I'm going to live with my friends. 


In response to the allegation that he  was arrested at Issa 's house during a raid by the Pakistani Police,  Ahmed spoke about how he understood that officials want to make sure foreigners papers are in order, and that this can require surprise raids.  But, when their papers are in order, they should be released.  He said his papers were in order, and he should have been released.  He said he believed that the Pakistanis sold him for a bounty.


In response to the allegation he was transferred to a prison in Kabul, he acknowledged that he was transferred.  Other captives were released.  He was told he would be released soon.  He suggested that a transfer from one prison to another was not proof that he was tied to al Qaeda.






Issa's role


The allegations against several other captives who were captured from the student dormitory where Ahmed lived, at the same time he was captured, faced the allegation that Issa was a senior member of al Qaeda.  They had an opportunity to reply to that allegation that was not provided to Ahmed.

History of Asturias
Asturian Queen consorts




Adosinda was the queen of Asturias during the reign of her husband, 









Silo








, from 
774 to 
783. She was a daughter of 









Alfonso I








 and 
Ermesinda, daughter of the first Asturian king, 
Pelayo. She was a sister of 









Fruela I








. 

Her husband probably succeeded to the throne by election because he was related by marriage to both of the previous ruling families. Some scholars have even posited a matrilineal succession. Anyway, she gave Silo no heir and, upon his death, her nephew 









Alfonso II








 was proclaimed king. He was expelled form the realm by 









Mauregatus








 and Adosinda was put in the monastery of 
San Juan de Pravia, in her husband's capital, on 
26 November 783. She probably died in the monastery.

Football (soccer) terminology




In sport (particularly 
association football), a two-legged tie is a match-up between two 
clubs or national teams that lasts over two individual games, used in 



knockout cup


 competitions. In typical two-legged ties, each team will play one game (known as a leg) at 
home. The reason for using two-legged ties is to determine the winner without giving any one of the teams a home field advantage.

Two-legged ties are particularly popular in international football tournaments, such as continental club competitions (e.g., the 




UEFA Champions League



 and the 




Copa Libertadores



), or 
play-off qualification games in international team competitions, such as the 

FIFA World Cup
. Some domestic cup competitions, such as the 

Coppa Italia
 and the 

Copa del Rey
, also feature two-legged ties.


The winner of the two-legged tie is the team with the better aggregate score, which refers to the sum of the scores from the two games. For example, if the scores of the two legs are:



First leg: Team A 4 1 Team B


Second leg: Team A 1 2 Team B


Then the aggregate score will be Team A 5 3 Team B, meaning team A wins the two-legged tie.


If the aggregate score is tied after the two legs, various methods can be used to break ties. The 
away goals rule, where the team who scored the more away goals advances, may come into consideration. If away goals are equal, or are not considered, then the tie may be decided by 
extra time and/or 
penalty shootout. 
Replays, though less common these days, may also be used. In 
Mexican football competitions, the team with the better season record advances if the aggregate score is tied.


As each team hosts one match, there is no explicit advantage to whether a team plays at home first or second. However, most managers and players feel that the team playing at home for the second leg has a slight advantage over the other team. The thinking is that the team playing away for the first leg can play it safe there (a draw or even a slight defeat is considered a favourable result), and then  win  the tie at home in the second leg. For example, in the draw for the first knockout round of the UEFA Champions League, the group runners-up will play the first leg at home, while the group winners will play the second leg at home. Nevertheless, this theory has never been proved by any statistical data.

Burton Gilliam

150px





Burton Gilliam (born 
August 9, 
1938) is an 








American







 
actor.



Biography



Early life


After suffering a fall during childhood in Dallas, Burton suffered a form of brain damage known as 
aphasia which in turn, caused his childhood academic performance to plummet. It was only after his dropping out of high school, and his subsequent enlistment in the 










United States Coast Guard









 that the military doctors were able to effectively diagnose Gilliam's malady.




Career


His first calling was not to the stage, but to the ring. He was considered the heart of the Coast Guard's boxing team, and reportedly posted an impressive record of 201 wins out of 217 fights during his enlistment. Gilliam was credited with winning more 

Golden Gloves
 bouts than anyone in its history at that time. While he did seriously consider turning professional, he ultimately decided to return to Dallas upon completing his Coast Guard enlistment. There, he followed in his father's footsteps and joined a local fire department, where he spent the next 14 years safeguarding the Dallas area. Upon his return to Texas, Gilliam had also completed his General Equivalency Development (
GED) diploma with exemplary scores.


The silver screen made its first official calling through a local newspaper article. Burton, while working as a firefighter, noted a reporting article on a film to be shot in the local Dallas area. While he had no experience, and no real knowledge of the entertainment industry, he made his way to the casting director to seek a role as an extra. He made an immediate impression, and his first cinematic bid landed him the speaking role of `Floyd' the desk clerk in the

Tatum O'Neal

Madeline Kahn


 film: 
Paper Moon. His unique style was noted by producer / director 


Mel Brooks

 and he was sought out to play his most memorable role in Brooks' comedy hit - 

Blazing Saddles
. A role in which he not only stamped his image on the Hollywood roster, but reportedly made cinematic history as one of the first to 
fart on the silver screen during the infamous campfire scene.


Another of Gilliam's memorable scenes was in Back to the Future III in which he portrayed a gun salesman whose puzzled look followed 


Michael J. Fox

's pronouncement that he had learned to shoot at 

7-Eleven
.


Gilliam has proven himself a capable actor over the years in numerous smaller, but no less memorable roles such as the leader of the 'Flying Elvises' (Utah Chapter) in the feature film 

Honeymoon in Vegas
. Gilliam s other films include: 
Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, 

Farewell, My Lovely
, 
Fletch, 
Gator, 

Telefon
, and 
The Jericho Mile. His television appearances include: 
Charlie s Angels, 

The A-Team
, 

The Fall Guy
, and he appeared as a regular on 

Evening Shade
'.


Today, Burton continues to pursue his acting career. He currently stars in a series of television commercials for a local auto dealer, Rodeo Ford, in Dallas, in which he is seen wearing his infamous Blazing Saddles western outfit. (However, his most notable commercial role must be as one of the national spokesman for the popular 

Pace's
 Picante Sauce commercials -  This stuff's made in New York City? .) Another North Texas Ford dealership, Middlekauff Ford, began in August 2007 to run counter-commercials with a Gilliam look alike (and sound alike) being carried off the dealer's lot by two men after he intimidated a customer. 2008 was greeted by the end of this rivalry with Gilliam proclaiming in a Rodeo Ford ad,  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  Middlekauff Ford became Rodeo Ford of Plano.


Gilliam is also still active in boxing as a referee - calling numerous championship bouts - as well as supporting charitable activities, celebrity events, and area theatrical endeavours.




Personal life


Burton resides with his wife, Susan, in 

 Allen
, Texas just north of Dallas. They have two children and four grandchildren who also live in the local area. His granddaughter, 








Hollie Vise







, is a World champion gymnast. He is currently the spokesman for Rodeo Ford in Dallas and Plano and Homer Skelton Ford in Memphis.

Viceroys of New Spain







Martin de Mayorga, Viceroy of New Spain




Martin de Mayorga Ferrer (
September 12, 
1721, 










Barcelona









, 



Spain


 1783, Spain) was a Spanish military officer, governor of 

Guatemala
 (from June 1773 to 1779), and interim viceroy of 
New Spain (from 
August 23, 
1779 to 
April 28, 
1783).


Martin de Mayorga Ferrer was a field marshal in the royal army of Spain, and a knight of the military 
Order of Alcantara. He was governor, president of the Audiencia and captain general of Guatemala at the time of the devastating earthquake that destroyed 

Guatemala City
 (
July 23, 
1773).


He was still serving in those positions at the time of the death of New Spain Viceroy 
Antonio Maria de Bucareli y Ursua in 


Mexico City

. When the 



Audiencia


 of Mexico opened the sealed instructions in the event of the death of Bucareli, they found that the captain general of Guatemala was named as replacement. When the instructions had been written, this was expected to be 
Matias de Galvez y Gallardo, brother of 
Jose de Galvez, minister of the Indies. However, Galvez, although appointed to the position, had not yet arrived to fill it. The Audiencia of Mexico therefore named Marshal Martin de Mayorga, who still held the position, viceroy of New Spain.


Mayorga arrived in Mexico City 
August 23, 
1779, and took up his new position. Of immediate concern were preparations for defense in the war that France and Spain had recently declared on England. He greatly reinforced 

Havana
, took extra precautions at 

Veracruz
, and sent an expedition under 
Bernardo de Galvez to Florida to aid the English colonists in their revolution against England. There was also fighting with the English in Belize.


In 1779 there was an epidemic of smallpox that spread to many cities of the colony and caused many deaths. Viceroy Mayorga spent considerable sums to aid the sick and dying. He offered his resignation (the first of several times), but it was not accepted.


In January 1780, the 
indigenous of 
Izucar (
Puebla) rose in rebellion because of mistreatment. Captains 
Jose Antonio de Urizar and 
Tomas Ponton were sent to suppress the rebellion. A large number of captured rebels were sent to Havana to serve as sailors in the fleet.


Mayorga did much to improve the capital, paving many streets with stones and cleaning the waterways and aqueducts in an effort to prevent another epidemic.


In 1780 he directed the governor of Puebla to assemble documents related to the history of New Spain, beginning with the Historia Antigua de la Nueva Espana of Father 
Mariano Veytia and papers collected by 

Lorenzo Boturini Bernaducci
. This project probably saved numerous documents that would otherwise have been lost.


In l783, the viceroy once again submitted his resignation. This time it was accepted. He turned over the government of the colony to his replacement, 
Matias de Galvez, on 
April 28, 
1783, and left for Spain. He died just before or just after reaching port at 
Cadiz. Some said he was poisoned by his successor. (The two were enemies and Galvez had never forgiven him for occupying the viceroyalty in his stead.) However this was never substantiated.

February 8, 2003




The Riot Act Tour was a concert tour by the American 
rock band 


Pearl Jam

 to support its seventh album 

Riot Act
. It was the band's first tour since the 2000 

Binaural Tour
.


History


Pearl Jam promoted Riot Act with tours of 

Australia
, 
Japan, and North America in 2003. The tours were the band's first with keyboardist 

Boom Gaspar
. The two legs of the North American tour focused on the 


Midwestern United States

, the 
East Coast of the United States, and the 
West Coast of the United States. Opening acts for the tours included 




Johnny Marr



, 


Sparta

, 







Sleater-Kinney






, 


Buzzcocks

 and 


Idlewild

.


Pearl Jam received much publicity for its energetic politically-charged performances during the tour. The band gave a noteworthy performance during the encore of its 

Perth, Western Australia
 show where it was joined on stage by 


Hunters   Collectors

 frontman 








Mark Seymour







 to perform  

Throw Your Arms Around Me
 , a personal favorite of frontman 




Eddie Vedder



. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's  Bu$hleaguer , a commentary on 

President
 



George W. Bush


, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then typically hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had  impaled  the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's 

Denver
, 





Colorado




 show.1 Following a performance of the song at Pearl Jam's April 30, 2003 show in 





Uniondale




, 





New York




, the band was met with boos from the crowd and chants of  U-S-A.  Vedder responded by defending his right to free speech and the band followed with a performance of 



The Clash


's  

Know Your Rights
 .2


The song  Arc  was performed by Vedder at nine shows during the second North American leg of the tour as a tribute to the victims of the 

Roskilde
 disaster.3 On the second leg of the North American tour the band performed a three-day set of 

Boston
, 

Massachusetts
 shows. Pearl Jam played a completely different set list each night, spanning 105 songs from its catalog with only one repeat between the three shows, the popular concert-ending  

Yellow Ledbetter
 . In May 2003, Pearl Jam extended its North American tour by announcing that it would be playing in 








Mexico







 for the first time. Before the first concert on July 17, the band gave its first press conference in almost ten years. In addition, the third concert was transmitted live on radio and television to all of 










Latin America









 for free.


The Australia, Japan, and North America tours were documented by a long series of 




official bootlegs



, all of which were available through the band's website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: 

Perth
, 













Tokyo












, 

State College
, 





Pennsylvania




, two shows from 









Madison Square Garden








, and 

Mansfield
, 

Massachusetts
. One of the four warm-up dates was released as a DVD entitled 

Live at the Showbox
, which was made available through the band's website. The first of two shows at 









Madison Square Garden








 was released as the 

Live at the Garden
 DVD.

Ludo is an 
alternative rock band from 

St. Louis, Missouri
. They are signed to a multi-album deal with 

Island Records
.



 History 


Ludo gets their name from a character in the film 

Labyrinth
.1 It started when the duo of lead vocalist and guitarist 

Andrew Volpe
 and guitarist Tim Ferrell played occasionally around St. Louis. Deciding to pursue Ludo full-time, they expanded to a five-piece group in 2003 with Tim Convy on 
moog, bassist Marshall Fanciullo and drummer Matt Palermo. 


Ludo recorded their self-titled debut album, 

Ludo
, and released it on their own indie label, Redbird Records in August of 2003. For the next few years, the band toured extensively with other midwestern bands, such as 
The Dog and Everything, 


Anything But Joey

 and Upside.  This exposure brought them moderate indie success.  The band returned to the studio in 2005 and recorded the EP 

Broken Bride
.  Broken Bride is a 
rock opera about a man who travels through time to attempt to save his wife from dying in a car accident in 1989.  The opening track,  Broken Bride: Part 1,  was a song that originally stood alone before evolving into the full opera.


In recent years, Ludo has been putting on themed concerts at The Pageant in St. Louis, Mo. and The Blue Note in Columbia, Mo. These include HalLUDOween, A Very Ludo Christmas, and Cinco de Mustache. Their fun outlook and interactive shows gained the attention of major labels 

Capitol Records
 and 

Island Records
.




 Island Records and You're Awful, I Love You 


In 2007, Ludo signed a five-album deal with Island Records that allowed them to turn Redbird Records into an imprint of Island. Part of the deal includes that any non-commercial material (i.e. Christmas albums or rock operas) would be released under the imprint. In spring 2007, Ludo headed to southern California to record their major-label debut with 


Maroon 5

 producer 






Matt Wallace





. On 
February 26, 
2008, 

You're Awful, I Love You
 was released.  The lead single was  Love Me Dead , a song written in 2004. Two music videos were made, an official version and a fan-participation video.  They also performed the song live on 

The Tonight Show with Jay Leno
 on 
July 11, 
2008. Also in 2008,  Love Me Dead  has been adapted to a commercial teaser for the show 
 House, and was #10 on the No. 1 Alternative Countdown on 
 Fuse the week of 
August 18, 
2008.

The Caramoor International Music Festival is a summer music festival founded in 1945 that is held on the 90 acre estate of the 
Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts Inc., which includes a Mediterranean-style stucco villa and is located about 50 miles (80 km) north of 





New York




 City in 










Katonah, New York









.

The Caramoor estate became a centre for the arts and music following the 







World War II






 death of the son of its owners, Walter and Lucie Rosen.  The couple donated the property in their son's memory, and it quickly became an established summer festival.  Performances are given in the Spanish Courtyard of the house and in the 1,700-seat Venetian Theatre, a tented facility on the grounds. The Music Room in the house is also used for year round concerts.


For the past eight years, the 
opera focus has been Bel Canto at Caramoor, with explorations of the 
bel canto repertoire under the direction of the conductor, 



















Will Crutchfield


















.  Semi-staged performances of such rarities (for the New York area) as 
Rossini's 






Otello





 and 







Donizetti






's 
Elisabetta (the manuscript of which was discovered and then reconstructed by Crutchfield).  Other innovative approaches to bel canto have resulted in 2005 productions of 






La sonnambula





 where the tenor's role was sung in the original keys and a 






La traviata





 where the majority of the standard cuts were restored.


The Caramoor International Music Festival also features a wide variety of music beyond Bel Canto Opera. Included are concerts by the 


Orchestra of St. Luke's

, string quartets, various soloists, and two day-long jazz festivals. Caramoor also features a composer in residence, with such composers as 
John Musto (2006) and 



Paquito D'Rivera


 (2007) holding the post. The Orchestra of St Luke's is the orchestra in residence under conductor 







Donald Runnicles






 of the 



San Francisco Opera


.  Former music directors have included 










Julius Rudel









 and 
Andre Previn; the present one is 
Michael Barrett.

Statue of Liberty
Replicas




Several smaller 
replicas of the 
















Statue of Liberty















 have been created worldwide.


France





Statue of Liberty on the 
Ile des Cygnes, river Seine in Paris, France. Given to the city in 1889, it faces west, towards the original Liberty in New York Harbor.






Model in 





Jardin du Luxembourg




, Paris



Two replicas of the Statue of Liberty are found in 

Paris
, France.  One stands in the 





Jardin du Luxembourg




: this is a bronze model that 
Bartholdi used in designing the New York statue; the artist offered it to the Luxembourg museum in 1900 and it was placed in the park in 19061.  The date written on this statue's tablet (where the New York statue has  JULY IV MDCCLXXVI ) is  15 de novembre 1889  (
November 15, 
1889), the date at which the larger Parisian replica was inaugurated.  This second Statue of Liberty in Paris is near the 



Grenelle Bridge


 on the 
Ile des Cygnes, an island in the river 
Seine (
48 51 0 N 2 16 47 E  /  48.85, 2.27972, 11.50 m (37 feet 9 inches) high. Dedicated on 
November 15, 
1889, it looks towards the Atlantic Ocean and hence towards its  larger sister  in New York Harbor, which had been erected three years earlier.  Its tablet bears two dates:  IV JUILLET 1776  (
July 4, 
1776: the 

United States Declaration of Independence
) like the New York statue, and  XIV JUILLET 1789  (
July 14, 
1789: the 
storming of the Bastille). This statue is shown in the movie  as one of the historic locations.


A life-size copy of the torch, 



Flame of Liberty


, can be seen above the entrance to the 

Pont de l'Alma
 tunnel near the 
Champs Elysees in Paris. It was given to the city as a return gift in honor of the Centennial Celebration of the statue's dedication. Since it is above the Pont de l'Alma car tunnel in which 
Princess Diana died, the torch became an unofficial memorial to the Princess.


A third replica is the 





Bordeaux




 Statue of Liberty. This 2.5 m (8 ft) statue is in the city of Bordeaux in Southwest 

France
. The first Bordeaux statue was seized and melted down by the Nazis in 







World War II






. The statue was replaced in 2000 and a plaque was added to commemorate the victims of the 

September 11 terrorist attacks
. On the night of 
March 25, 
2003, unknown vandals poured red paint and gasoline on the replica and set it on fire. The vandals also cracked the pedestal of the plaque. The mayor of Bordeaux, former prime minister 
Alain Juppe, condemned the attack. 


There is a fourth replica in the northwest of France, in the small town of Barentin near 








Rouen







. It was made for a French movie, Le Cerveau ( the brain ), directed by Gerard Oury and featuring actors 

Jean-Paul Belmondo
 and Bourvil.2


A fifth replica is located in the center of the town 





Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer




 near 
Marseilles, France.34


A 12 m (39 ft 4 in) replica of the Statue of Liberty in 










Colmar









, the city of 
Bartholdi's birth, was dedicated on 
July 4, 
2004 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his death. It stands at the north entrance of the city.56 The Bartholdi Museum in Colmar contains numerous models of various sizes made by Bartholdi during the process of designing the statue.7




United States





One of the 200 








Lady Liberty statues







 donated by the 
Boy Scouts of America is located on Michigan s 

Mackinac Island
 in historic Haldimand Bay



From 1902 to 2002, visitors to Midtown Manhattan were occasionally disoriented by what seemed to be an impossibly nearby view of the statue. They were seeing a 30-foot (9.1 m) high replica located at 43 West 64th Street atop the Liberty Warehouse.89 In February 2002 the statue was removed by the building's owners to allow the building to be expanded.10 It was donated to the Brooklyn Museum of Art which installed it in its sculpture garden on October 2005, and plans to restore it on site in spring of 2006.1112 





Replica of the Statue of Liberty, Las Vegas



A bronze sculpture of the Statue of Liberty is on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.13




Duluth, Minnesota

Boy Scouts of America celebrated their fortieth anniversary in 1950 with the theme of  Strengthen the Arm of Liberty .16  Between 1949 and 1952, approximately two hundred 100-inch (2.5 m) replicas of the statue, made of stamped copper, were purchased by Boy Scout troops and donated to various towns in the United States. The mass-produced statues are not great art nor meticulously accurate (a conservator notes that  her face isn't as mature as the real Liberty. It's rounder and more like a little girl's ), but they are cherished, particularly since 

9/11
. Many have been lost or destroyed, but preservationists have been able to account for about a hundred of them, and BSA Troop 101 of Cheyenne, Wyoming has collected photographs of over 100 of them.1718

The radial notch of the 
ulna (lesser sigmoid cavity) is a narrow, oblong, articular depression on the lateral side of the 
coronoid process; it receives the circumferential articular surface of the 
head of the radius. 

It is concave from before backward, and its prominent extremities serve for the attachment of the 
annular ligament.

The 
1984 





National League Championship Series




 was played between the 


San Diego Padres

 and the 













Chicago Cubs












 from 
October 2 to 
October 7. San Diego won the series three games to two to advance to the 









World Series








. The 1984 NLCS was the first postseason series ever for the Padres since the franchise's beginning in 
1969, and the first appearance by the Cubs in postseason play since the 







1945 World Series






. The series took a disastrous turn for Chicago after a promising start, which contributed to the popular mythology of the  
Curse of the Billy Goat.  The series was also the last best-of-five NLCS. In 
1985, the League Championship Series changed to a best-of-seven format.

(Note: Due to a 
strike by major league umpires, the first four games were played using local and collegiate umpires, with major league umpires returning for the final game. They rotated positions following Game 1, but not following Game 3. The Game 5 umpires were selected because they lived in the area; only Kibler had originally been scheduled to work the series.)

Chicago's offense was considerably more subdued in Game 2, though their pitching remained almost as strong. Dernier again opened the scoring for the Cubs in the first, singling to left and coming around to score on two groundouts. The Cubs got two more runs in the third, highlighted by 





Ron Cey




's RBI double. San Diego got one back in the fourth when 
















Tony Gwynn















 doubled and eventually scored on a sacrifice fly by 








Kevin McReynolds







. But Chicago answered in the bottom of the fourth when

 doubled in Dernier. San Diego cut the lead to 4-2 in the sixth on a run-scoring single by 







Steve Garvey






, but the Padres could get no closer against the strong pitching of 









Steve Trout








. 

Lee Smith
 came on with one out in the ninth to get the save, and the Cubs were just one victory away from the World Series.

The series moved to San Diego, and the Padres staved off elimination with a convincing 7-1 win. San Diego actually fell behind 1-0 in the second when Chicago's 











Keith Moreland










 doubled and came home on Cey's single to center. But the Cubs would get no more off Padres starter

, while San Diego's bats finally came to life with seven runs in the fifth and sixth. 










Garry Templeton









 knocked in two runs with a double in the fifth, and McReynolds essentially ended the game with a three-run homer in the sixth. 
Goose Gossage pitched a dominating ninth inning to wrap up the win for San Diego.

Game 4 proved to be the most dramatic of the series, and it left many Cubs fans dreading another harsh disappointment for the franchise nicknamed the  lovable losers.  The Padres jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the third on a sacrifice fly from Gwynn and a run-scoring double from Garvey. The Cubs actually took the lead in the fourth on a two-run homer by 










Jody Davis









 and a solo shot by 










Leon Durham









, who would suffer ignominy in Game 5. The Padres tied the game in the fifth on another RBI from Garvey, and took the lead in the seventh when Garvey singled in yet another run. A passed ball allowed a second tally in the inning to make the score 5-3 San Diego. The Cubs bounced back in the eighth to tie the game on an RBI single by Moreland and an RBI double from Davis.


With dominating closer Lee Smith on the mound for the Cubs in the bottom of the ninth, Gwynn singled to center with one out. Garvey then capped an extraordinary five-RBI game by launching a two-run 
walk-off home run to right center field just over the glove of Cubs right fielder 








Henry Cotto







 at the 370 sign. The series was now tied as the Cubs suffered one of their most devastating postseason losses ever.

As if to tease their fatalistic fans, the Cubs started out well in the final and deciding game of the series. Durham hit a two-run homer in the first and Davis added a solo homer in the second to give the Cubs a 3-0 lead. With 

National League
 



Cy Young Award


 winner and Game 1 victor Rick Sutcliffe pitching brilliantly, the Cubs maintained their lead until the bottom of the sixth. Then disaster struck in a way that left many Cubs fans muttering about 
curses and other storied collapses in the franchise's history.


Chicago's downfall began innocently enough, with San Diego getting two sacrifice flies in the sixth to cut the Cubs' lead to 3-2. But the Padres' seventh proved catastrophic for Chicago. 
Carmelo Martinez led off the inning with a walk, was sacrificed to second by 










Garry Templeton









, and scored when 





Tim Flannery




's grounder trickled through Durham's legs for a crucial error. 







Alan Wiggins






 singled Flannery to second, and Gwynn doubled both runners home to give the Padres a 5-3 lead. Garvey followed with an RBI single to stretch the lead to 6-3. Steve Trout then replaced Sutcliffe on the mound and got out of the inning unscathed.


The Cubs got three baserunners over the final two innings against Gossage but could not score, and San Diego took home its first National League pennant. The Padres would go on to lose the 









World Series








 to the dominant 










Detroit Tigers









 in five games.

Argentina

 and studied at the State Technical University in 
Santiago de Chile, where he participated in the musical  
penas  and other cultural and student activities. He spent some time at the Naval Academy where he showed an aptitude for playing football. He joined 
Quilapayun in 1967 to replace 
Julio Numhauser (who left the group) and he rapidly become the most distinctive and loved member of the musical ensemble. He was the solo vocal on a number of songs, including  Canto a la 
Pampa  of the 

X Vietnam (album)

Cantata Santa Maria de Iquique,  La Carta  and  Pido Castigo . He played guitar, winds and percussion and he was central on stage during live performances. He was a lover of Argentine folk music (especially of 
tangos and zambas) and a great fan of 

Los Fronterizos
. 


Oddo remained in 
exile in France until 1987 when he left to work in Argentina. Once democracy returned to chile in the late 1980s he moved to Chile and worked at the Municipality of Santiago until the 7th of November 1991, when he was tragically and brutally assassinated.

The Needles




The Needles of the

 of 





South Dakota




 are a region of fantastically 
eroded 
granite pillars, towers, and spires.  Popular with 
rock climbers and 
tourists alike, the Needles are accessed from the 





Needles Highway




, which is a part of 
Sylvan Lake Road (SD 87/89).  The Cathedral Spires and Limber Pine Natural Area, a portion of the Needles containing six ridges of pillars as well as a disjunct stand of 
limber pine, was designated a 



National Natural Landmark


 in 1976.


The Needles were the original site proposed for the

. It is situated 23 km east of 









Sigmaringen








, and 27 km north of 


Ravensburg

Celtic settlement and owes its name to the spring goddess 
Sulis. The first historical reference to the settlement dates back to 819. In 1239, the town was acknowledged by 


Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor

. It became a possession of the 








House of Habsburg







 in 1299, and thus part of the 

Holy Roman Empire
.


In 
Napoleonic times, it was given to the 
Kingdom of Wurttemberg. During 







World War II






, a subcamp of the 








Dachau concentration camp







 was located in the town.1 The name of the town was officially changed in 2000 from Saulgau to 
Bad Saulgau.

Personality tests




The Inwald Personality Inventory (IPI) is a 310 question  true-false  inventory designed to identify a variety of personality and behavioral characteristics.  It is primarily used to screen applicants for high-risk positions such as police candidates.  This assessment, or test, was developed in response to the requirements of the public safety/law enforcement selection process.  


 History and Use 


The IPI was developed by Dr. Robin Inwald and was first published in 1980 by Hilson Research, Inc.  In March 2007, the assessments of Hilson Research were acquired by IPAT's Public Safety and Security Division.  The IPI is copyrighted and trademarked.  Clinicians must pay a fee each time it is administered.  


Twenty-five clinical scales and one validity scale, Guardedness, is used in the assessment.  The clinical scales are Rigid Type, Alcohol, Drugs, Substance Abuse Driving Violations, Job Difficulties, Trouble with the Law and Society, Antisocial Attitudes, Hyperactivity, Absence Abuse, Illness Concerns, Treatment Programs, Anxiety, Type  A , Phobic Personality, Lack of Assertiveness, Obsessive Personality, Depression, Loner Type, Interpersonal Difficulties, Family Conflicts, Sexual Concerns, Spouse/Mate Concerns, Undue Suspiciousness, Unusual Experiences/Thoughts.  


The IPI was developed from over 2,500 pre-employment interviews with public safety officer candidates.  The items were designed to detect stress reactions in the context of law enforcement as well as deviant behavior patterns.  


The IPI was developed in part to counter the use of psychopathology tests (such as the MMPI) for use as public safety selection tests.

Lionel Hitchman (born

The Grotte des Demoiselles is a large cave located in the 
Herault valley of southern 

France
, near 



Ganges


, about 60 km (38 mi) east of 
Nimes.



History



Many legends and stories have been linked with the cave, the existence of which has been common knowledge in the 






Languedoc





 region since time immemorial. The best known legend tells of a shepherd looking for a lost lamb who wandered into the swallow hole that marked the entrance to the cave. He heard the lamb but could not see it, and so he continued deeper and deeper into the cave, until he reached the chamber now known as the cathedrale (cathedral). With only a torch for light, he slipped and fell to the bottom of the chamber (a 60-metre plunge between 
stalactites and 
stalagmites). Knocked senseless by the shock, he noticed just before passing out a group of young ladies dancing and singing around him. When he woke up, he was back on the surface with his lamb. The modern name of the cave, Grotte des Demoiselles ( maidens' grotto ) reflects this legend; previously it had been known as the Grotte des Fees ( fairies' grotto ).


At various times in history the cave has also served as a hiding place and refuge.


In 
1889, more serious exploration of the cave was undertaken by the renowned 
speleologist 
Edouard-Alfred Martel. At the time, visiting the cave was quite perilous, but in 
1931 a 
funicular, concrete stairs and walkways with sturdy railings and extensive electric lighting were installed to make it accessible to the general public; and since then it has been a popular regional tourist attraction.




Formation of the cave



The Grotte des Demoiselles is thought to have initially been formed by the collapse of overlying 
limestone, made fragile by water 
erosion. However, some doubt remains as to the source of the water: it may have been an underground stream that has now disappeared, or it may have been a stream that is now about 300 metres (980 years) lower, although no link with the latter has been discovered thus far.

Bilingual-bicultural or BiBi 
educational programs focus on making the classroom 
bilingual via a means of natural native 
sign language used to buttress learning for a 
written 
spoken language.

Famous examples of schools utilising the BiBi method in the US include 



California School for the Deaf, Fremont


; 



Maryland School for the Deaf


 and especially 



Indiana School for the Deaf


.


Deaf teacher and vlogger (or video blogger) Barb DiGi specialises in bilingual education of the Deaf and has released a few vlogs on this topic: 
The Right of the Deaf Child to Grow Up Bilingual and 
Bilingual instruction in action with Deaf Children: NALB. NALB, or  No ASL Left Behind  has gained popularity with the Deaf community.

Critical Reception






The film earned a 61 metascore (out of 100) on 

Metacritic
, which means  generally favorable reviews.  1







The film earned a 57% rating on the Tomatometer at 

Rotten Tomatoes
, with a 71% positive rating coming from the cream of the crop critics. Though the film is not certified fresh, it is only one positive review away.2







Though the film itself has received mixed reviews, the majority praise 

John Turturro
's performance. 

LA Weekly
 says  Turturro ... never wavers in his commitment to a role that deprives him of nearly all his actorly tools. (He) keeps Fear X fascinating.  1 The 
New York Daily News says  Turturro's subtle turn keeps our emotional connection solid  2 and 
Compuserve adds  Turturro gets under your skin.  2






The Ending






There is no universally-accepted interpretation of the ending.







Director 

Nicolas Winding Refn
 commented on the ending within several interviews:


In an interview with 

BBC
:


Harry s impossible quest raises questions, but it all adds to the brave elliptical nature of this film. So did Refn ever get to the bottom of those questions in his own mind?  I can t answer that,  he says bluntly.  It depends on how I feel that day. And of course that pisses off a lot of people because they re not used to a film without an ending. But what the f**k is an ending, you know?  3


In an interview with 


IndieWire

:


 Fear X  is about idealists and when they're confronted with reality, a lot of the time their ideals are tested and turned and they're no longer what they thought they would be...4


 You can view it in many different ways... it's so up to your own interpretation. 4


How were we going to end this, without giving anything away, without making it too obvious, because the minute the audience's mind begins to work, you're on very dangerous ground. Because if you tell them too much, they're disappointed and if you don't give them any clues, they get confused. So it's that fine line of giving the audience as they walk out, okay, I believe it's this or I believe it's that. We never gave more in the script. 4







Actor 

John Turturro
 also commented on the ending within an interview with 

Channel 4
:


 I liked it because the idea of the story was about a simple man thrust into this overwhelming, debilitating circumstance, and he never really finds out what happens... Nicholas doesn't have all the answers to what he's trying to do. A lot of times these guys, their biggest problem is solving the script, but Nicholas seems to be a filmmaker who likes to throw the script away. 5

Claverdon railway station serves the village of 





Claverdon




 in 
Warwickshire, 

England
.


The station sees up to six 

Chiltern Railways
 departures in each direction on the 

Stratford-upon-Avon
 to 

Leamington Spa
 line every day except Sundays, and four of these trains continue to or start from 
London Marylebone, giving Claverdon a direction connection to the capital.


The line on which the station stands was opened as a single-track branch in 1860, but was doubled between 





Bearley




 and 
Hatton in 1938 and a new two-platform station was built at Claverdon. When the second track was lifted in 1969 Claverdon reverted to being a single-platform station.

Sex and the City characters





Sex and the City was an 








American







 
cable television program based on the 
novel of the same name by 


Candace Bushnell

. It was originally broadcast on the 
HBO network from 1998 until 2004. Set in 

New York City
, the show focuses on the sex lives of four female best friends, three of whom are in their mid-to-late thirties, and one of whom is in  her forties. Along with these four women, there were numerous minor and recurring characters, including their current and ex-boyfriends/husbands/lovers, as well as many 
cameo appearances.

There is also a 2008 .



__TOC__



Main characters



Carrie Bradshaw





Main article: 

Carrie Bradshaw


Carrie Bradshaw (



Sarah Jessica Parker


) is the literal voice of the show as each episode is structured around her train of thought while writing her weekly 
column,  Sex and the City,  for the fictitious newspaper, The New York Star. A member of the 





New York




 glitterati, she is a club/bar/restaurant staple who is known for her unique 
fashion sense - violently yoking together various styles into one outfit  (It is not uncommon for her to pair inexpensive 
vintage clothing pieces with high-end couture). A self-proclaimed 
shoe fetishist, she focuses most of her attention (and bank account) on designer footwear, primarily 






Manolo Blahnik





s, though she has been known to wear 






Christian Louboutin





 and 










Jimmy Choo









 ,as well. Known to frequently go on shopping sprees, Carrie pays a lot of attention to her constantly evolving personal style, which is very high on her priority list; her style is one not fettered by professional dress codes or personal self-effacement.  Even though she relies only upon her income as a freelance weekly newspaper columnist, she is often guilty of overspending her limit and maxing out her credit card in a single shopping trip.  To some viewers, her lack of shoe-shopping self-control and overall seemingly immature spending habits might be a flaw, and her money-management misadventures follow her through a few episodes of the series. However, her priorities are later brought into perspective when she is forced to either buy her once rent-controlled apartment when the building goes co-op, or move out. Carrie does finally acquire a mortgage by supplementing her income, having to take on other writing assignments to do so because she doesn't want to move (she also takes a sizeable loan from Charlotte - in the form of her engagement ring to Trey - to pay for the down payment). Her apartment is another source of pride; it's an open-planned studio in an 








Upper East Side







 brownstone that is certainly enviable for its stabilized rent, space, large closet, and good location. The apartment, which she eventually purchases back from ex Aidan in the fourth season, is her home for the entire run of the series. In later seasons, her essays are collected as a book and she begins taking assignments from other publications, like 

Vogue
 and 
New York Magazine. 





Charlotte York





Main article: 
Charlotte York Goldenblatt

Charlotte York (


Kristin Davis

), is an art dealer and 

Smith College
 graduate with a wealthy 

Connecticut
 blue-blooded upbringing. She is the most 
conservative and traditional of the group; the one who places the most emphasis on emotional love as opposed to lust, and is always searching for her  knight in shining armor.  As the youngest of the group, she's also the most idealistic about love and romance. Presenting a more straightforward attitude about relationships, usually based around  

the rules
  of love and dating, she often scoffs at the lewder, more libertine antics that the show presents (primarily by way of Samantha). Despite her conservative outlook, she has been known to make concessions (while married) that even surprise her sexually-freer girlfriends (such as her level of dirty talk, 
oral sex in public and  
tuchus-lingus ). Charlotte gives up her career shortly after her first marriage, divorces upon 
irreconcilable differences around 
in vitro fertilization and receives a 
Park Avenue apartment in her divorce settlement. She eventually remarries to her less-than-perfect, yet good-hearted divorce lawyer, Harry Goldenblatt, after converting to 
Judaism  Together they adopt a daughter from 
China in the last episode.





Miranda Hobbes





Main article: 

Miranda Hobbes


Miranda Hobbes (

Cynthia Nixon
), is a career-minded 
lawyer with extremely cynical views on relationships and men. A 

Harvard University
 graduate from 

Philadelphia
, she is Carrie's best friend, confidante, and voice of reason. In the early seasons, she is portrayed as masculine and borderline 
misandric, but this image softens over the years, particularly after she becomes pregnant by her on again-off again boyfriend, Steve Brady, whom she eventually marries. The birth of her son, Brady, brings up new issues for her 
type A, workaholic personality, but she soon finds a way to balance career, being single, and motherhood. Of the four women, she is the first to purchase an apartment (an indicator of her success), which she gives up in the final season when she moves into a 

Brooklyn
 
townhouse to make room for her growing family.





Samantha Jones





Main article: 
Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)

Samantha Jones (


Kim Cattrall

), the oldest of the group, is an independent 
publicist and a seductress who avoids emotional involvement at all costs, while satisfying every possible carnal desire imaginable. She believes that she has had  hundreds  of soulmates and insists that her sexual partners leave  an hour after I climax.  In season 3, she moves from her full-service 








Upper East Side







 apartment to an expensive 
loft in the then-burgeoning 
Meatpacking District. Over the course of the show, Samantha does have a handful of real relationships, but they are more unconventional than those of her friends.  These include a lesbian relationship with Brazilian painter Maria, played by 
Sonia Braga.






Recurring characters





Serious relationships



Mr. Big





Main article: 
Mr. Big (Sex and the City)

Mr. Big (

Chris Noth
), referred to by Carrie and her friends simply as  Big,  both excites and eludes Carrie throughout the run of the show, as she always believes he is the man for her, but many times, he's not able to fulfill her emotional needs. A wealthy financier (Samantha calls him  the next 


Donald Trump

  in the pilot), Big is based on New York publisher 
Ron Galotti
http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/n_10334/. Carrie and Big's on again, off again relationship begins and ends in season one and then a second time in season two. After two years of commitment issues and emotional unavailability, Mr. Big marries a twenty-something 


Ralph Lauren

 executive named Natasha (

Bridget Moynahan
). Within seven months of his marriage he begins to pine after Carrie and starts to have an affair with her, until Natasha catches them and Carrie breaks it off out of guilt. After divorcing Natasha, Big and Carrie become friends, with their sexual history always lying just beneath the surface. He eventually moves to the 
Napa Valley in California, but is visited once by Carrie while on her book tour, and he returns to New York a year after that for an 
angioplasty. In the end of the series, he returns to tell Carrie he is ready to commit to her, but is brutally rebuffed. He doesn't give up, and, after the blessing of Charlotte, Samantha and Miranda, tries to re-claim her love one last time in Paris. In the end, the two prepare for an open, honest relationship in New York. The writers claim that the use of a 
moniker instead of an actual name was a symbol for the character's emotional unavailability. Curiously, there were several instances in the course of the series that almost revealed Big's first name, such as when Carrie tried to introduce Big and Natasha to Aidan at a furniture expo, but ends up spilling coffee on Big due to her nervousness, thus spoiling the mystery. But in the final episode of the series, Big's real name is revealed to the audience as  John  when he calls Carrie about his move back to New York from California. In the movie, it is revealed that John's full name is John James Preston.





Aidan Shaw





Aidan Shaw (


John Corbett

) is Carrie's other long-term boyfriend. He is a sweet, good-natured furniture designer and Mr. Big's emotional opposite. At first Carrie is put off by their seemingly perfect relationship, but over time works through her issues of emotional unavailability. However, Aidan ends  it  when she comes clean about her affair with Big. They get back together a year later, eventually move in together and she accepts his marriage proposal before they realize that, ultimately, she cannot meet his needs and they break up for good. It is later revealed that Aidan marries and has a son, Tate.




Jack Berger





Jack Berger (

Ron Livingston
) is Carrie's intellectual counterpart, a sardonic humorist writer whose career is cooling down just as Carrie's is heating up. Theirs is a relationship of witty banter and common thoughts, but everything falls apart when his defeated attitude clashes with her success. Carrie learns, when it comes to relationships, Berger's talk is just that. He memorably breaks up with her on a Post-It:  I'm sorry, I can't, don't hate me. 




Aleksandr Petrovsky


Aleksandr Petrovsky (


Mikhail Baryshnikov

), referred to by Carrie occasionally as  The Russian,  is a famous artist who becomes Carrie's lover in the final season. He sweeps her off her feet with huge romantic gestures and shows her the foreign pockets of New York that she has never seen before. Her relationship with him brings up all sorts of questions in Carrie's mind about finding love past  a certain age  and whether or not she wants children. When he's preparing to return to 

Paris
 for a solo exhibit he invites Carrie to come live with him, which, after several deliberations (and one fight) with her friends, she does. After spending some time there, she realizes that he will never reciprocate the level of emotional involvement that she offers because his life and career will always come first.




Trey MacDougal





Dr. Trey MacDougal (


Kyle MacLachlan

) fits Charlotte's knight in shining armor archetype to a tee; a 

Scottish American
 heart surgeon from family money.  Their whirlwind engagement and a fairy tale wedding stop cold with a sexless honeymoon, brought on by Trey's 
impotence and his domineering and meddling mother Bunny. After a brief separation, they reunite with a healthy sex life only to discover that Charlotte has difficulty getting pregnant. Eventually, their disagreements on whether or not to pursue 
in vitro fertilization lead to divorce.




Harry Goldenblatt





Harry Goldenblatt (

Evan Handler
) is Charlotte's Jewish divorce lawyer who is incredibly attracted to her from the beginning. She is not attracted to him initially, but tries to pursue a sex-only relationship with him, which leads to one of exclusivity and love as opposed to her relationship with Trey, which was reversed in this aspect. After her conversion to Judaism and one big argument that sends them in separate directions for a few weeks, the two marry and begin trying to have/adopt a child. In the end, they are approved for a Chinese adoption and adopt a girl. In the film, Charlotte finally becomes pregnant by Harry and gives birth to a baby girl. Their adopted daughter is named Lily and their biological daughter is named Rose.




Steve Brady





Main article: 

Steve Brady


Steve Brady (

David Eigenberg
) is a bartender who has an unconventional on-again, off-again relationship with Miranda. Having been stood up by Carrie, Miranda meets Steve unexpectedly at the bar at which he works. She takes the encounter as a one night stand and reacts callously to his suggestion that they see each other in the future. Their differences in income, aspirations and status, as well as their attitudes about living together and having kids are the catalysts for their break ups. Over the course of the show Miranda puts Steve through a fair amount of emotional tumult. However he looks beneath her cynical exterior and finds her softer side while at the same time choosing his battles carefully. In season four he opens his own bar, called Scout, and accidentally gets Miranda pregnant (despite losing a testicle to cancer and Miranda having only one functioning ovary). They decide to raise the child (Brady Hobbes) together even though they broke up before his birth.  However, they are back together towards the end of Season Six. They have a small intimate wedding ceremony and he convinces her to move to a house in 

Brooklyn
.




Richard Wright



Richard Wright (


James Remar

) is a successful hotel magnate who doesn't believe in monogamy until he meets Samantha. He seduces her, and when their no-strings-attached sexual relationship begins to escalate, both parties struggle to keep their emotional distance. Eventually, they give in and attempt exclusivity, but, being a stranger to 
monogamy, Samantha is plagued by suspicion at every turn. When she does catch him cheating, after putting on a wig and spying on him, she breaks up with him, but eventually takes him back after he begs for her forgiveness. In the end, Samantha still has her doubts about Richard, and breaks up with him. Towards the end of the series, Richard re-surfaces, admitting that Samantha was the best thing that ever happened to him. But after having sex with him, she rejects him for Smith Jerrod.




Smith Jerrod



Jerry Jerrod/Smith Jerrod (

Jason Lewis
) is a young waiter Samantha seduces in a trendy restaurant called  Raw . She tries to maintain her usual sex-only relationship with him, but he slowly pushes for something more. He is a wannabe actor whose career Samantha jump starts using her PR connections (including changing his name to  Smith Jerrod  from  Jerry Jerrod ), getting him a modeling job that turns into a film role. Just when she thinks Smith's age and experiences aren't enough for her, he gives her unconditional support during her fight with breast cancer. In the final episode, Smith flies back from a film set in Canada just to tell her that he loves her, which she counters with  You have meant more to me than any man I've ever known,  which, for Samantha, is a far greater statement.





Significant others



Skipper Johnston



Skipper Johnston (
Ben Weber) is a geeky, sensitive twenty-something web designer whom Carrie introduces to Miranda. From the moment they meet, Skipper is enamored with her, but Miranda is unimpressed and irritated by him, calling him  Skippy . They date for a short time, before Miranda breaks up with him due to  being in different places .




Robert Leeds



Dr. Robert Leeds (


Blair Underwood

) is a sports medicine doctor who moves into Miranda's building during season six. He is the seemingly perfect man: successful, sexy, and utterly devoted to her. Robert and Miranda have lots of fun and great chemistry, but when the time comes she is unable to declare her love for him, in part because she still loves Steve.




James



James (
James Goodwin) is a man Samantha meets while out by herself at a 
jazz club.  She makes a conscious effort to not sleep with him until she gets to know him first. When they finally do have sex, she discovers that he is under-endowed to the point that she cannot enjoy herself. (His fully erect penis is 3  long.) She begins pulling away physically and cannot bring herself to tell him   until she is faced with the prospect of couples counseling. 




Maria Diega Reyes



Maria Diega Reyes (
Sonia Braga) is a sensual lesbian artist that Samantha meets at a solo exhibit while admiring her work. Maria is immediately attracted to her, but since Samantha doesn't believe in relationships they try to maintain a friendship.  The chemistry proves to be too strong and it isn't too long before Samantha is introducing her lesbian lover to her stunned friends. At first, Samantha has a great time  getting an education  as Maria teaches her about lesbian sex and how to make an emotional connection while making love. Unfortunately, Samantha begins to grow uncomfortable when the relationship talk starts to replace the sexual activity and Maria is equally uncomfortable with Samantha's sexual history. The two separate, after they have sex with a 


strap-on

.





Friends



Stanford Blatch





Stanford Blatch (

Willie Garson
), often referred to as the show's  Fifth Lady,  is Carrie's best friend outside of the three women. A 
gay 
talent agent from an 
aristocratic family with a sense of 
style paralleled only by Carrie's, viewers receive the impression that they have a long-standing relationship built within their younger, wilder days in the 

New York City
 
club and 
bar scene in the 1980s. He had said that they have been friends since Carrie was riding the subways and wearing 


Candie's

. The only supporting character to receive his own 
storylines on occasion,  Stanford represents the show's most constant 
gay 
point of view to 
sex on the show, generally based around the physical insecurities and inadequacies of someone who does not  have that gay look.  In the last two seasons of the show, he is partnered with 
Broadway dancer Marcus Adente.




Anthony Marentino





Anthony Marentino (

Mario Cantone
) is a 
Sicilian-American 
event planner who becomes close to Charlotte after styling her first 
wedding   he goes on to style Charlotte's H G photo shoot, her second 
wedding and Carrie's book release 
party. He is not self-effacing like 
Stanford and freely doles out , sometimes 
bawdy, 
advice to Charlotte. (For instance: Upon hearing that she hadn't had sex since her divorce, he exclaims:  If you don't put something 'in there' soon, it'll grow over! ). In Season 4, Episode 2, Charlotte tries to set up Anthony and Stanford. Neither finds each other a suitable 
date 
partners; 
resentment and 
competition ensue for the entire show run. However, in the film the two are seen kissing at a New Year's Eve party.




Magda





Magda (

Lynn Cohen
), the 

Ukrainian
 
housekeeper 
nanny who was introduced in the third season becomes an 
ersatz mother figure and a 
thorn in Miranda's side. Her attempts to push traditional 
marriage/
motherhood attitudes on Miranda are both subtle (buying her a 
rolling pin  To make pies. It's good for a woman to make pies. ) and intrusive (replacing her 
vibrator with a statuette of 
The Virgin Mary). She is friendly to Steve even before he and Miranda are back together, and adores Brady to the point of making a collage of his pictures. Magda comes to accept Miranda's lifestyle choices and continues working for Miranda, even when she and Steve move to 
Brooklyn. Although Miranda is reluctant to accept help, Magda makes life manageable for Miranda after the birth of Brady by serving as both a housekeeper and a nanny.




Bitsy von Muffling



Bitsy von Muffling (






Julie Halston





) During the last episode of Season 5, the girls meet aging socialite Bitsy von Muffling right before and during her 
Hamptons 
wedding to 
gay/
bi 
cabaret entertainer 
Bobby Fine. We see her again in the middle of Season 6 pregnant with Bobby's baby. She advises Charlotte, who's also had trouble becoming pregnant, to try acupuncture like she did. In the movie, we do see a brief reappearance of Bitsy that didn't wind up on the cutting room floor. She's seated halfway down the table (right next to Stanford) during the dinner party.

Artifical island Al Lulu''



Al Lulu Island (

Arabic
:              lrm;) is a 1050-acre man-made island off the coast of 
Abu Dhabi island. It stretches from the Abu Dhabi Breakwater to the Zayed Sea Port. 
Land reclamation was completed in 1992. After several plans which were subsequently dropped, the island is now being developed by 
Sorouh as a mixed commercial and residential project. It was also rumoured that Al Lulu Island was going to be a tourist destination for a Disney theme park during the mid-90's .


Opening of Island


In April 2007, the Island opened to public, featuring the following:



 Two restaurants


 Four coffee shops


 Two stretches of beach on the north and south part of the island


 Changing rooms


 Cafeterias


 A duned area


 Mosques


 Two artificial fresh-water lakes


As of April 29, the island is not under construction, but the buildings need cleaning and maintenance, such as the restaurants, which are still not ready.




Transportation


There are four boats that are capable of transporting 25 people, and a sea bus capable of 60. The boat ride is free of charge, and takes off from the Abu Dhabi Breakwater next to the Heritage Village. Lifejackets are available on board. Once in the island, there is a choice between a train ride to a person's destination or a bus tour.




Entrance fees


Entrance to the island, open from 8 am to 8 pm, costs 15 
 dirhams per person. Children under five years of age are admitted for free. To ride the train, an additional five dirhams are required, while the bus is free. There are several activities on the island such as paddling boats and riding camels and horses.

The Akron Vulcans were a professional football team from 

Akron
, 





Ohio




. The team played in the 

Continental Football League
 for part of the 
1967 season. The league existed from 1965 to 1969, and its principal goal was to serve as a minor league to the 

National Football League
 and the 


American Football League

.

The Akron Vulcans actually played only four games in the Continental Football League, one game versus the Miami Dolphins,. The team won one game and lost the other three before disbanding due to financial difficulties. 











Doak Walker










 and 








Lou Rymkus







 each served as the Vulcans  coach during the squad s brief existence.


The financial difficulties faced by the Akron Vulcans consisted of the team's owner 
looting the equipment and selling it to friends and family just hours before a raid by Akron, State and Federal officers.

.






Scott Manning's 

BD-5J
,  The Stinger 


 Scott Manning (15 May 1958 - 
16 June 
2006) was a Canadian athlete and aerobatic 
pilot of the world's smallest jet, the 

BD-5J
.


Growing up in 

Kitchener
, 

Ontario
, Scott earned a degree in 
Environmental Studies at the 

University of Waterloo
 in 1985. Having played for four years on the 

Waterloo Warriors
 football team, he pursued a career in professional 
football, at a weight of 290lbs. and 6'3 . In the 1980s, he attended training camps with the 



Saskatchewan Roughriders


 and the 



Montreal Alouettes


. Scott pursued his football career until a serious knee injury caused a blood clot that almost killed him and rendered him incapable of continuing in the sport. Although told by doctors that he would probably never walk again, Manning slowly regained his mobility. 



After two years of recovery, Manning decided that he simply  wanted to fly jets in airshows  and set out pursuing private and commercial pilot's licences and eventually earned flight time in some of the world's most advanced aerobatic aircraft.1


In 1990 he purchased and decided to construct  The Stinger  BD-5 microjet airplane kit. Construction work took over 6000 work hours. At the end of several engine malfunctions, and countless technical hiccups, the BD-5 emerged as a tiny, but formidable competitor in the 
aerobatics arena. Manning piloted his own plane, and was known as the tallest BD-5 pilot in the world,2 and the operator of the only model in Canada. 


On 
June 16, 2006 at 12:14pm Manning was piloting his BD-5J when he crashed, tragically losing his life during practice for the 

Ottawa
 Air Show.3


On May 2, 2007, the Canadian Transportation Safety Board issued final Aviation Investigation Report A06O0141 on Manning's accident. The report stated one Finding as to the Causes and Contributing Factors of this accident.


1. The right flap was incorrect installed during the wing installation, which allowed the right flap to retract during the fly-past. This created a flap asymmetry that resulted in an uncommanded right roll. The aircraft was at an attitude from which recovery was not possible before the aircraft struck the ground. 


The report also stated two Findings as to Risk.


1. The right-wing taper bolt did not penetrate deep enough through the spars to engage the fibre locking feature of the locknut. Therefore, the taper bolt was not in safety at the time of the accident.


2. The fibre locking feature of the left-wing locknut was worn and did not secure the left-wing taper bolt in safety.

Unincorporated communities in Oregon
Lane County, Oregon




Alvadore is an 
unincorporated community in 

Lane County
, 





Oregon




, 








United States







, located nine miles northwest of downtown 

Eugene
 and one mile northeast of 

Fern Ridge Reservoir
.

Alvadore was named for Alvadore Welch of 

Portland
, who built the 
Portland, Eugene and Eastern Railway through the community.1 The 
railway was later acquired by the 






Southern Pacific Railroad





, but in 1936 the track was torn up.1 Alvadore post office was established in 1914.1


According to the 
U.S. Geological Survey's database of geographic names, Alvadore is the only locality so named in the United States. 2




Alvadore experienced its heyday during the early 1900s, serving as a railroad stop on the important route between Eugene and Portland. At this time the town was home to a hotel, several shops and a schoolhouse that was demolished in 2006. When the railroad bypassed the town in subsequent years, growth subsided. 


Today Alvadore is home to a general store and gas station that contains a 
post office (ZIP Code 97409), a large regional nursery Decker Nursery known for its 
Christmas trees, a 
volunteer fire department, the Alvadore Christian Church, a nut-drying plant affiliated with 


Blue Diamond Growers

, and a variety of other agricultural businesses including an 









organic








 strawberry farm (Berg's Berries and Organic Produce).

817 Squadron's crest



817 Squadron is a 
Royal Australian Navy Fleet Air Arm squadron. 


Current Roles


817 is currently active as a helicopter squadron equipped with 

Westland Sea King
 Mk 50 helicopters. 817 Squadron is a land based squadron operating the Sea King helicopter in Fleet Utility Support roles, including Search and Rescue, Surveillance, and Air and ground crew training. 817 Squadron also has responsibility for maintaining and operating aircraft on the 



Kanimbla class


, 
HMAS Tobruk'' and 
HMAS Success''. The Squadron is based at 

HMAS Albatross''
 (NAS Nowra).




History





817 Squadron Sea Kings on board HMAS Melbourne in 1980



817 Squadron was first formed as a 




Royal Navy



 

Fleet Air Arm
 squadron in 1941, operating 

Fairey Albacore
 aircraft in the ASW role in Icelandic and Mediterranean waters. The Squadron reformed in 1943 with 

Fairey Barracuda
 aircraft and carried out operations in Sumatra and the Nicobar area before disbanding in 1945.


On 25 April 1950, 817 Squadron was re-formed as a Royal Australian Navy FAA squadron operating 

Fairey Firefly
 AS6 aircraft. The Squadron embarked on 



HMAS Sydney''


 and served with distinction during the Korean War, operating the Fairey Firefly Mk5. In October 1953 the squadron embarked on 





HMAS Vengeance''




. The Squadron disbanded and reformed with 

Fairey Gannets
 in 1955, operating from 



HMAS Melbourne''


 and conducting Fleet ASW support and training until 1958.


817 Squadron reformed in 1963 to conduct ASW, Fleet Utility support and training, equipped with 

Westland Wessex
 HAS.31A helicopters. These were updated to Wessex HAS.31Bs in 1968, and the Squadron was re-equipped with Westland Sea King MK50 helicopters in 1976. 817 Squadron operated from 



HMAS Melbourne''


, until the aircraft carrier decommissioned in 1982 without replacement.


Recent operational deployments have included UN operations in 

Somalia
 in 1993, peace keeping operations in 


Bougainville

 during 1998 and Operation Stabilise in 

East Timor
 during 1999 and 2000. 817 Squadron has also provided operational air support to the 



2000 Sydney Olympic Games


 and support to the people of the 

Solomon Islands
 during 2000 and 2001 in Operation Trek, after the civil insurgence. The squadron was also called upon in 2003 to provide further air support in the Solomon Islands as part of Operation Anode.


817 Squadron has been heavily committed to the fight against terrorism with continuing deployments to the Persian Gulf aboard 



HMAS Kanimbla''


 and 



HMAS Manoora''


. These deployments have formed an integral part of the Australian contingent of the International Coalition Against Terrorism (ICAT). During late 2001 and 2002, 817 Squadron aircraft deployed to the 

Persian Gulf
 as part of 








Operation Slipper







 to enforce UN sanctions against Iraq, and again in 2003 as part of 
Operation Falconer with the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq. The Squadron also has maintained one aircraft and crew at 

Christmas Island
 for various periods to provide a surveillance capability in defence of Australia's northern borders.


Most recently, 817 Squadron has provided aircraft for Operation Sumatra Assist and Operation Sumatra Assist II, which were Australia's contribution to the humanitarian effort in Indonesia as a result of the 
2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the subsequent 
2005 Sumatran earthquake. During the latter operation, 







Shark 02






, one of the two Seakings embarked on 



HMAS Kanimbla''


, crashed on the Island of 

Nias
 with the loss of nine personnel.

Fruit of Camellia crapnelliana''





Camellia crapnelliana (       or    ) is a 5-7 metre tall small tree with thickly leathery leaves and solitary and terminal flowers.


In 1903, the 
species was first collected and described by W. J. Tutcher from 



Mount Parker


, 

Hong Kong
; only one plant was found at that time 1.


In Hong Kong, it is distributed in 



Mount Parker


 and Mau Ping in 



Ma On Shan


. It is also distributed in 

Guangxi
, 

Fujian
, 

Zhejiang
2.


The seed oil is edible.


The plant was introduced to Japan in 1968. Only a small number of plants have been cultivated in Japan because grafting on C. japonica or C. sasanqua is difficult 1.


In Hong Kong, it is a protected species under 
Forestry Regulations Cap. 96A.

Star Voyager



ASCII



Single player





Star Voyager is an outer space shooter for the 

Nintendo Entertainment System
.  The gameplay is a first-person shooter from inside the cockpit of a spaceship.  The player navigates  sub spaces  of a larger  world map.   Gameplay takes place between different subspaces.


Released in Japan as 
Cosmo Genesis



Gameplay


The plot centers around a lone pilot in a spacecraft attempting to protect a transport ship, the CosmoStation Noah, full of planetary 
refugees from a fleet of intergalactic terrorists known as the Molok Wardrivers. The player's primary goal is to eliminate all enemy fleets before they can surround the stationary CosmoStation Noah. The player may also visit up to eight different planets in search of engine and weapon upgrades for their ship. Players may also seek repairs at up to five space stations in addition to CosmoStation Noah. The player may also visit an 
asteroid field, and a 
black hole from which escape is impossible. The game is won if the player defeats the enemy 
armada. However, the game is lost if the enemy fleet reaches the CosmoStation Noah, the player enters the black hole, the player's ship runs out of fuel crystals, or if 
life support fails.


Gameplay occurs on a 10x10 grid that is randomized at the start of each game with the exceptions of the player and CosmoStation Noah will always begin in the top left, and the five initial Molok Wardriver fleets will begin in the bottom right. To progress through the grid, the player must select their destination coordinates either through the HUD or the select menu grid, and hold down the B button to charge enough power to travel as many sectors as required to reach their destination, as identified by the number on the bottom-center of the HUD. The number of leaps charged is indicated by icons in the upper-left gauge.


As gameplay progresses, additional fleets may join the Molok Wardriver armada. Any planets or space stations they encounter during their trek to the CosmoStation Noah will be destroyed, limiting the resources the player will have to mount an attack. In order to destroy the enemy fleets, the player must warp to their coordinates and destroy the fleet's spacecraft and mothership, which will endlessly deploy enemy spacecraft as long as it remains operational. The player must raise their shields in the select menu in order to minimize damage taken to the ship.


The player's fuel crystals will deplete normally over time, and faster during warping or sustaining damage. Therefore it is necessary to visit space stations to refuel to prolong gameplay. They can also repair damaged systems which include radar, engines, weapons, and life support. Depending on the amount of damage taken, the engines may become inoperable, one or both laser cannons can malfunction, and radar can become difficult to use.

Donkey Heart

250




 

Donkey Heart is an  
indie rock band from 
Montreal, Quebec, Canada . Its members are Sinbad Richardson, Neyza Honore C., Martin Cesar and Austin Davis-Richardson.  As of May 2005, the band is on indefinite hiatus, performing their last show for the 2005 edition of 



Pop Montreal


.


The band was known for its 
DIY attitude and energetic live performances, which often included makeshift costumes, toy instruments, partial to full 
nudity and lots of dancing. 



 History 



Donkey Heart began as a project for Sinbad Richardson and Martin Cesar.  It included an old 






Roland





 
CR-5000 [drum machine], a [guitar], a [record player] and Sinbad and Martin rapping.  They performed under the name King Donkey Heart at various parties and social gatherings.  


Eventually, the project turned into a full fledged band with the addition of Martin's friend, Neyza, and Sinbad's cousin, Austin.  Sinbad became the guitarist, Neyza the keyboardist, Austin handled the drum machine and Martin sang.  The band renamed themselves Donkey Heart and played their first show together at the now defunct 
Le Swimming.


The band began performing around Montreal on a regular basis, performing with bands such as  

The Dears
, 
Bad Flirt, Rance Mulnix, Beaver, The Alex Chow Symphony Orchestra, 
Telefauna, Rocket v. Robot, Raw Madonna,  


Stars

, The Diskettes, 
Pony Up!, Dead Bush, and many others.


During their 2004 Pop Montreal appearance, the band was listed under the name Kevin Hates Us.  Shortly after, the band went back to their original name, stating that the name change was an inside joke.




Discography



Donkey Heart released three [CD-Rs].  These releases were only sold at shows, in limited quantities (normally about 15).  The packaging was all hand made.  These releases are:





 Before the Day (EP)


 One Last Bottle of Dry Heave Lotion (EP)


 Donkey Heart: A Collection of Recorded Material (LP)






Where are they now


Austin moved to Florida and began a solo project entitled 
Tincan.  Martin helped form a new band known as

 Nookie  is the first single released from the album 
Significant Other by 


Limp Bizkit

. It is one of their biggest hits.

One of the reasons lead singer 






Fred Durst





 attributes to the song becoming a success is that it's sung slower, and in a fashion where his lyrics are easier to understand, in contrast to 

Three Dollar Bill, Yall$
's 
rapcore style, where the lyrics in some songs are indistinguishable due to the fast screaming style Fred uses on the album.



Meaning


The song is about Fred Durst's relationship with a past girlfriend, in which she used him for his money, and cheated on him with his friends, and yet he continued to stay with her despite the emotional distress this caused. The hook reveals his reason for staying in the relationship, which was because of the sex.  Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?/ I won't lie, that I can't deny/ I did it all for the nookie .


In a 2008 interview with British rock magazine 
Kerrang, guitarist 

Wes Borland
 had the following to say about how the lyrical content turned out:   The music was cool, but I didnt like the lyrics at all. The funny thing is that Nookie was actually the working title. When we were in the studio there was a porn magazine that had the word 'nookie' on the cover, so I was like, 'This song's called Nookie!', I never thought someone would actually run with it. I suppose it's all my fault.  .1




Music video


In the song's music video, the band allowed hundreds of fans to participate, playing the song in front of the large crowd. All the men went to one side of the stage, and the women on the other side. When Durst sang the chorus, at certain parts he would hold out his microphone to the crowd, getting that particular side to sing. This was, according to Durst, to show that  guys go off hard, but girls go off even harder . The audio from this plays during the music video. At the end of the music video, Durst is arrested, and taken away by police officers for no apparent reason.


The song was performed live on the first day of programming of 

MTV
's  Isle of MTV , their summer 1999 promotion. At the conclusion of the song, Durst detonated a ship sitting out in the water a few hundred yards from the stage.

Covers





 
Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered this as a 
Lounge version on his 
2000 album called, 

Lounge Against the Machine
 and his 
2006 album called, .






Parodies





 A parody version of the song as sung by 

Cookie Monster
 was created, called  Cookie .


 


Amy Poehler

 parodies the song in an edition of  Weekend Update  in a past episode of 

Saturday Night Live
.


 A parody circling around the internet called  I Did It All For the 
Wookie  has also been created.


 Christian parody band 
Apologetix did a Parody entitled,  Simp Lizkut.  It appeared on their Album 
Keep the Change.


 Atom Films has a version called  Pokee  sung by a fictional band called  Wimp Pizzed Kid  highlighting his frustration in losing and acquiring a 
Pokemon toy to show to his friends.






Additional Notes





 


Scott Weiland

 of 


Stone Temple Pilots

 and 


Velvet Revolver

 fame sings the sampled  hey  in the  like a chump  prechorus.


 For  Nookie , guitarist 

Wes Borland
 used a custom built 
baritone guitar with only four strings: tuned nearly an octave downward from 
standard tuning, the string's pitches were F#, F#, B and E. For the lowsest F# string (which is one octage lower than the higher F# tuned string), Borland made this string a bass guitar string. This technique of using bass guitar strings as the lowest strings on a guitar would later go on to be explored by technical metal band 




Meshuggah



 for their 8 string guitars. Borland also plays this particular guitar in the music video for the song.


 Scott Borland, Wes Borland's brother, plays keyboard on the song.


 The video was directed by Fred Durst.


 The song (unknown if intentional or not) mentions the 


Eve 6

 song 

Inside Out

Celia Elizabeth Rosser (born 1930) is a renowned 

Australia
n 
botanical illustrator, best known for having published 






The Banksias





, a three-volume series of monographs containing 
watercolour paintings of every 
Banksia species.

Born Celia Elizabeth Prince in 1930,12 she began painting Australian wildflowers early in her artistic career. She first began painting Banksias after seeing a 




Banksia serrata



 near her home in 

Orbost, Victoria
. Her first exhibition was at Leveson Gallery in 

Melbourne
 in 1965, and included three watercolours of Banksia species. Two years later she published Wildflowers of Victoria.3


In 1970, Rosser was appointed Science Faculty Artist at 

Monash University
. She illustrated Peter Bridgewater's The Saltmarsh Plants of Southern Australia and The Mosses of Southern Australia by George Scott and Ilma Stone.  In 1974 she was appointed University Botanical Artist, and began the project of painting every Banksia species. The project took over 25 years to complete, and resulted in the publication of a three volume monograph entitled The Banksias, with accompanying text by 

Alex George
. Publication of the final volume in 2000 represented the first time that such a large genus has been entirely painted.3


In 1977 she was awarded the 
Linnaean Society of London's 
Jill Smythies Award for botanical illustration, and in 1995 was awarded a Medal of the 






Order of Australia





. Monash University awarded her an honorary Master of Science degree in 1981, and an honorary PhD in 1999.3



Legacy


In March 1978 a chance seeding of 
Banksia canei with deeply lobed leaves and a 
prostrate habit was registered as a 
cultivar by Alf Salkin under the names  

Banksia 'Celia Rosser'
  and  Banksia canei 'Celia Rosser' .4


In 2001, Peter Olde and Neil Marriott published a description of a new Banksia species from the arid shrubland of 




Western Australia



, naming it 
Banksia rosserae in Rosser's honour.2


Since 2002, the Friends of the 





Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne




 have awarded the  Celia Rosser Medal for Botanical Art  to outstanding exhibitors at their  The Art of Botanical Illustration  exhibition.

Andrew Brough is a singer, songwriter and 
guitarist from 

Dunedin
, 









New Zealand








. 

Brough started out as the singer for the Dunedin band, The Blue Meanies (which also featured Martin Kean on bass and Max Satchell on guitar).


Following the demise of the Blue Meanies Brough formed the 
Dunedin sound three-piece 
The Orange, but became better known as guitarist and vocalist alongside 






Shayne Carter





 in 






Straitjacket Fits





, a role he held from 1986 (prior to the Fits' first release) until 1992, when he left the group following the tour to support their second album, Melt.


Known for his '60s influences, Brough is a gifted singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He is best known for the Fits track  Down in Splendour , a cascading melodic wall of sound that was voted among the top 20 New Zealand tracks of all time. His sweeter voice provided a contrasting counterpoint to Carter's harsher vocals on many early Straitjacket Fits songs.


After leaving Staightjacket Fits Brough emerged in the mid 1990s with his own band 
Bike, which also showed his love of classic 1960s pop. Since the release of that band's only album Take in the Sun, Brough has been largely silent. 


Songs from 'Take in the Sun' were used in the Australian soap opera, 'Home and Away'. 


Brough refused to take part in a Straitjacket Fits reunion in 2005. He currently (as of 2008) lives in 
North East Valley, Dunedin.

Transformers. The series was previewed with a #0 in October, 





2005




, formally launched with #1 in January 
2006 and ended with #6 in July.  

Written by long-time Transformers writer 

Simon Furman

Their first contact with humans on Earth is chronicled in this series. Most of the Transformers have updated alternate modes of current vehicles, although recognizable due to  paint schemes similar to their original incarnations.

Plot summary


After stealing a high-end palmtop PC from an anonymous businessman on a coach, hitch-hiker Verity Carlo is picked up by an intense man, Hunter O'Nion, who reveals he's an alien conspiracy theorist tracking down reports of giant machines in the area. They soon come across the coach Verity departed, which had been run off the road by a pair of sports cars - the businessman whose palmtop Verity stole is missing. 


The pair continue on, but are attacked by a blue fighter jet. Hunter's van is destroyed, but he and Verity are saved - by the smiling driver of a suspiciously well-armed ambulance... 


As their mysterious rescuer attempts to evade the pursuing fighter jet, Verity and Hunter start to realize that not only are they being attacked by one of the disguised mechanoids Hunter has sought but that the ambulance they're sitting in is also one of them. Suddenly, two sports cars, one white, one black, join the jet in pursuit of the ambulance. Deploying sophisticated gadgetry, the ambulance driver manages to lose their pursuers for a while, and Verity finds the fugitives a place to hide the automotive workshop of Jimmy Pink. 


Verity reveals that she and Jimmy are both net-hikers, members of a community of drifters who use the Internet to maintain their mutual-assistance network. Hunter realizes that not only is Verity's palmtop stolen, but that it's the very item that the jet and sports cars are trying to recover. He confronts the ambulance driver with a picture stored on the palmtop, but Verity, sick of conspiracy paranoia, takes it back from them and walks outside. 


Within a second, she's back inside, babbling frantically about Decepticons and the garage door is ripped from its mount, revealing two giant robots, one black, one white, demanding the palmtop. 


Confronted by two menacing robots, the stunned Verity, Hunter and Jimmy can only stand and gawp as the ambulance driver disappears in a blaze of electricity, stunning one of the robots - and as it falls into a garage wall, sending concrete everywhere, the ambulance itself transforms into a third giant robot, shielding the three humans from the rubble. As the robot who was a white sports car draws a weapon, the third robot deploys an ink spray, blinding his attacker, then folds itself back down, becoming an ambulance once again, and orders the three humans inside it. 


Back in the wilds of Arizona, a police detachment finds the dead body of the anonymous businessman. None of them can identify him - at least, not but one, who secretly calls group of people in a boardroom whose only distinguishing feature is a massive  M . 


The ambulance is once again picked up by the blue jet fighter and narrowly avoids a pile-up caused by the jet's sonic boom. This allows the two sports cars - who identify themselves as Runamuck and Runabout - to catch up, partially transforming to deploy weapons. According to the ambulance, this is a very disturbing sign, as Decepticons never break cover, let alone in such a brazen fashion. Some more fancy driving allows the ambulance to shake Runamuck and Runabout, but Verity, whom on top of fleeing for her life has had reality turned upside down on her, gets out of the ambulance and flees. 


While Jimmy goes to calm her down, Hunter tries to pry more detail out of the ambulance - starting with its name, Ratchet - but before he can get far, the jet re-acquires them. With everyone back inside, Ratchet goes on the run again, but three more cars with weapons that spring from hidden compartments appear and shoot the plane down. These cars then transform and draw weapons on Ratchet, and the leader - Prowl - informs Ratchet of the statutes of the Autobot Code of Interplanetary Conflict that he has violated. In his defense, Ratchet offers only two words: Siege Mode. 


Aboard the Autobot starship Ark-17, located at the bottom of Lake Michigan, Prowl gives Ratchet a through dressing-down for disobeying his orders and breaking cover, then tells him to find out just what's on Verity's stolen palmtop and get rid of the humans, refusing Ratchet's suggestion that Prowl alert Optimus Prime. Ratchet appears to Verity, Hunter and Jimmy in their containment cell and persuades Verity to hand the palmtop over. He shows them the mysterious businessman's photos and explains they show a Decepticon command bunker, mysteriously abandoned (which Decepticons never do) and apparently in Siege Mode much too early than standard Decepticon procedure. 


In the meantime, a police officer is investigating the dead body found on an Arizona reservation, tracking him to a caravan park - just as a pair of war-planes, one black, one purple, appear out of thin air and destroy the dead man's caravan, promptly disappearing again. Later, an Abrams battle tank destroys the remains of Jimmy Pink's garage, then transforms into the purple plane and along with the black one disappears yet again. Finally, the coach which Verity and the dead man traveled on is destroyed. 


Verity, Hunter and Jimmy insist that Ratchet take them to the Decepticon bunker in Nebraska so that they can locate the proof Ratchet needs to persuade Prowl of the severity of the Decepticon situation. Partway swayed, Rathet makes his mind up when Bumblebee offers to help out. The three humans and two Autobots make their way to Nebraska - just as the Decepticon lieutenant Starscream orders Skywarp and Blitzwing to destroy the bunker. 


Verity, Hunter and Jimmy explore the abandoned Decepticon base. In the process, Verity discovers a months-old human corpse and almost has a nervous breakdown. Topside, Skywarp and Blitzwing try to destroy the bunker, forcing Ratchet and Bumblebee into battle. Bumblebee is able to shoot down Skywarp, his processor speed outmatching Skywarp's, but Ratchet is taken out by Blitzwing. 


Meanwhile, the Machination prepares to  appropriate  Cybertronian technology, having discovered the location of Ark-19 via the SM-40's homing signal. 


Back underground, Verity discovers someone else has entered the bunker - Megatron. 


Skywarp and Blitzwing begin to level the Nebraska bunker. Jimmy and Hunter escape, but Verity is still below, paralyzed by fear at the sight of Megatron - who ignores her as irrelevant. As the bunker collapses in on itself, the Autobots and humans risk themselves to pull Verity to safety. 


Meanwhile, Starscream and Astrotrain refine the Ore-13 yield at the Oregon base, as Starscream plans to ingest the energy. 


Blitzwing and Skywarp survey the new crater, with Blitzwing believing the base and what they did there made them stop being Decepticons and it  deserves to be buried . At which point an enraged Megatron smashes his way out and destroys Skywarp with one shot. Blitzwing engages him and is smashed to pieces. The Autobots flee back to the Ark, knowing Megatron is out of their league. 


The Autobots report the data they gained to Prowl - Starscream's cell found a new variant of Energon they could directly apply to their systems. Quickly exhausted the seam, they abandoned the bunker for a new one in Oregon (which had a richer seam) and engaged Siege Mode to protect what they had. Megatron is here to  put his house in order , and nobody can tell how powerful Starscream's cell may have become. 


Starscream charges himself up to immense levels with Ore-13, intending to defeat Megatron. While the other Decepticons drop their guns and cease their mutiny upon Megatron simply talking, Starscream unleashes his full, devastating power. However, even Starscream's increased strength isn't enough to defeat Megatron and Megatron beats Starscream half to death. 
With Megatron now in command of the Earth cell and ordering Phase Two, Prowl realizes they need to call in Optimus Prime. Luckily, he's already arrived. 


Unluckily, the Machination have tracked the Autobots to their base.





Analysis


The biggest difference in this new G1 continuity is that the Autobots and Decepticons only recently arrived on Earth, rather than having been buried here for four million years. They have communications with Cybertron, and Optimus Prime and Megatron are seen in Cybertronian modes. While Optimus upgrades into an Earth based alternate-mode, Megatron retains his unique tank mode, although he is still familiar looking with his helmet, black arm cannon and silver paint.


This storyline explores more elements of the Transformers hiding on Earth. The Decepticons have multiple bases, with the Autobots discreetly hiding themselves amongst traffic with 
holographic drivers. Ratchet is also seen deploying a 
smoke screen.  In addition, the Decepticons place more stock in stealth in this continuity, preferring to destabilize a planet's society covertly before striking rather than attacking directly with the arrogant belief that their larger size and technological superiority will triumph over the  puny fleshlings .


Also exploring elements of the Transformers' presence is that there are indeed 
conspiracy theorists like Hunter looking at evidence of their existence, and indeed the whole plot revolves around the Decepticons attempting to cover up a massive piece of evidence. In particular, focus is given to the mysterious Machination, who represent the potential government interest and exploitation.


Strikingly, the Autobots and Decepticons bases are the reverse of what they are in other incarnations: The Autobots have an underwater base while the Decepticons are based out of a mountain.

The SK is a 
people mover built by the company Soule from 
Bagneres-de-Bigorre. The acronym SK comes from the initials of the production company (Soule) and of the designer (Kermadec).

The system is based on small cabins which are circulating on rails and are pulled by a cable at a constant speed. This is directly derived from the 
gondola lift assemblies which are already producted by the Soule company and which are working in many 
ski resorts.


A system of holding mechanism allows to reduce the speed or to halt the cabins in the stations. This technique only works on short lines ; its inability to work on long or curved lines with lots of stops is due to risk of losing the cable and lack of stability at normal speed.





 One line of SK is servicing the parking lot of the Exhibition grounds of 





Villepinte




.







 One line of SK was built in 





Noisy-le-Grand




 but the housing complex it was supposed to service was never built and therefore the line was cocoooned, waiting to be opened in the future.







 Two lines of 
SK 6000 have been partially built in 
Charles de Gaulle International Airport. The first line was supposed to be opened on May 1st 1996, but the length of the line (3500m) was creating many technical problems making impossible to open it for public service. The line 2 should have open in 1997, but it was never opened either.




Never put into operation, this last project had a cost of 148 millions euros. It was replaced by 

CDGVAL
.

Steven Dale Green (born 
May 2, 
1985) is a former 









Private First Class








 in the 









United States Army








 who is charged with 
raping a 14-year-old Iraqi girl named 
Abeer Qasim Hamza al-Janabi and murdering her and three of her family members in the village of 
Mahmudiyah.



Biographical details


Green graduated from 
Infantry Training Brigade and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 
502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 
101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), 

Fort Campbell
, 





Kentucky




. According to a military spokesperson and a criminal complaint filed in connection with the charges, Green was honorably discharged from the military  due to 
antisocial personality disorder but before the military was aware of the incident. 1  


Green grew up in 

Midland, Texas
. According to school officials, he dropped out of high school in 2002 after completing the 10th grade and moved to 
Denver City, Texas, where he earned his high school equivalency in 2003.  Days after a January 2005 arrest for alcohol possession, Green enlisted in the 
US Army. In doing so, he was granted a moral character waiver for prior drug and alcohol related offenses that might have otherwise disqualified him.  Green was stationed in 

Iraq
 from September 2005 to April 2006 and discharged in May 2006.2




Mahmudiyah incident






Main article: 
Mahmudiyah incident


On 
June 30, 
2006, the 
FBI arrested Green, who was held without 
bond and transferred to 

Louisville, Kentucky
. On 
July 3, 
2006, 
United States Federal Court prosecutors formally charged him with raping and killing 
Abeer Qassim Hamza, a 14-year-old girl, and with killing her five-year-old sister Hadeel, her father, Qassim Hamza Rasheed, and her mother, 
Fakhriya Taha Muhasen in Mahmoudiyah, on 
March 12, 
2006. On July 10, the U.S. Army charged four other active duty soldiers with the same crime. A sixth soldier, Sgt. Anthony Yribe, was charged with failing to report the attack, but not with having participated in the rape and the murders.


Green and four other soldiers, Sgt. 
Paul E. Cortez, Spc. 












James P. Barker











, Pfc. 
Jesse V. Spielman, and Pfc. 
Bryan L. Howard, had planned raping Abeer Qassim Hamza. Pfc. Howard was ordered to monitor radio traffic while the others entered the Hamza family's house. Green ordered the father, mother, and younger daughter to a bedroom and shot them, saying:  I just killed them; all are dead.  Green, and at least one other soldier, raped Abeer Qassim Hamza, after which Green shot her in the head two or three times. Five soldiers, including Green, have been formally charged with raping the girl and murdering her parents and little sister. The soldiers Paul E. Cortez, James P. Barker, Jesse V. Spielman, and Bryan L. Howard might face the death penalty, said Maj. Gen. 
William B. Caldwell in a news conference. 3


Reportedly, Fakhariya Taja Muhassain worried that her daughter, Abeer, had attracted the unwanted attention of U.S. soldiers at the checkpoint near their home. She asked her neighbor, Omar Janabi, if she could sleep in his daughter's room at his house. Janabi agreed, but the Hamza family were murdered the next day.4 Janabi, who said he discovered the Hamza family bodies, found the husband, the wife, and the younger, five-year-old daughter in one room, all shot dead. In another room of the Hamza house, Janabi found Abeer Qassim Hamza's burned body.




Trial


On 
July 6, 
2006, Green entered a plea of not guilty through his public defenders. U.S. Magistrate Judge 
James Moyer set an arraignment date of August 8 in 

Paducah
,

On 
July 11, 
2006, his lawyers requested a 
gag order.  This case has received prominent and often sensational coverage in virtually all print, electronic and 
Internet news media in the world.   Clearly, the publicity and public passions surrounding this case present the clear and imminent danger to the fair administration of justice,  said the motion. 6 Prosecutors had until 
July 25, 
2006 to file their response to the request.7


On 
August 31, 
2006, a federal judge rejected a gag order. U.S. District Judge Thomas Russell said there is  no reason to believe  that Green's 
right to a fair trial would be in jeopardy. Furthermore he added,  It is beyond question that the charges against Mr. Green are serious ones, and that some of the acts alleged in the complaint are considered unacceptable in our society. 8


In July 2007, federal prosecutors, led by Brian Skaret of the 

United States Department of Justice
's 
Domestic Security Section, announced they will be seeking the death penalty for Green. This is based on the fact that prosecutors believe the rape and killings were premeditated, and were committed using a firearm.


The prosecution of this case is unique in that although the alleged crimes were committed by an active member of the United States military, which normally would fall under the jurisdiction of the military court system, Green was 
indicted and arrested after he had been discharged from the Army. Thus, the case is being tried instead by the United States Department of Justice's 
Domestic Security Section.




Retaliation


Green was assigned to the same platoon as Spc. 
David J. Babineau, who was shot to death at a roadside checkpoint on 
June 16, 
2006, in 








Yusufiyah







, and 

Kristian Menchaca
 and 

Thomas Lowell Tucker
, who were captured, 
tortured and killed, allegedly by 

















Iraqi insurgents
















. Military investigators are now looking into whether the insurgents abducted Menchaca and Tucker in retaliation for the killing of the Iraqi civilians.9 However, in the first video depicting the desecration of what is believed to be the bodies of both Menchaca and Tucker, there is no mention of the incident at Mahmudiya at all. It is only in a second release of the video, two months later, that any mention of the Mahmudiya incident is made.

This article is about the Palestinian Abu Obeida.  For the Companion (
sahaba) of Muhammad, see 
Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah.  

Abu Obeida  (         ) is a Palestinian spokesman for the 







Al Qassam Brigades






 of 

Hamas
. He was frequently quoted by the press regarding captive Israeli soldier 

Gilad Shalit
 following Israel's June 2006 invasion of Gaza. 



Quotes






The Palestinian militants had no choice but to respond to the Zionist crimes because by carrying out such actions, the Zionists are putting our people in a position of self-defense. (June 9, 2006) Announcing the cancellation of Hamas' ceasefire with Israel following the killings of 15 Palestinians in Gaza in 24 hours by the IDF.1 







We will turn Sderot into a ghost town. (June 10, 2006)2 







We are ready to confront any stupid act that the Zionists might commit. We are well prepared and God willing, we are not going to welcome them with flowers. (June 27, 2006) Following the massing of Israeli forces on the Gaza border.3 







Israel is responsible for the consequences of attacking Gaza. By these operations, they are exposing the Israeli soldier to danger. The Israeli soldier could be in any of the houses bombarded by Israeli aircraft and the Israelis would have to look for his dead body in Gaza. (June 28, 2006) Referring to Israeli soldier 

Gilad Shalit
 taken prisoner on June 25th during Operation Scattered Illusions.4







This crisis can last weeks or months, until Israel accepts to negotiate with the Palestinian resistance...Our priority is the liberation of our prisoners, by diplomatic channels or other means. (July 21, 2006) in an interview with Agence France Press.5







What we find shameful is the attitude of the international community which has moved heaven and earth to denounce the capture of one soldier and does nothing to avoid the deaths of Palestinian civilians...The captured soldier is Israel s excuse for intensifying its crimes. Bombarding the power station and bridges, killing innocent civilians, is that supposed to accelerate his liberation? (July 21, 2006) additional quotes from AFP interview.6







There may be a later announcement. ... But we don't claim this honor yet. (2008, March 07) Following the massacre of eight 
Yeshiva students killed after a Palestinian gunman went on a shooting rampage at a 
Jewish seminary in 













Jerusalem

Fictional regions of space
Honorverse locations
Incomplete lists




This is a list of regions in the 
Honorverse, and short descriptions.

This list is ; you can help by 
expanding it.



 Sectors in the Honorverse 






 Haven Sector


 Haven Sector is based around the star 
Haven. Haven is capital of the (People's) 


Republic of Haven

. The sector was named by Solarian League cartographers. The entire sector lies within the Republic. The Republic is larger than the sector.







 Maya Sector


 Maya Sector is headquartered in the Maya system, on the planet Smoking Frog. The sector is economically advanced and several of its planets are candidates for membership in the Solarian League. At the time of the Honorverse stories, it is nevertheless still under the control of the League's Office of Frontier Security. The current OFS sector governor, Oraville Baragos, has adopted policies (including support for an independent Torch system) which are sufficiently popular in the sector that OFS is unable to directly remove him. The tension between the sector and OFS has been high for some years.







 Monica Sector


 Monica Sector is named for the Monica system. The 


Talbott Cluster

 and its Lynx Terminus of the Manticore wormhole junction lie within the sector, as does the Lynx system itself.







 Silesia Sector


 Silesia Sector is named after the star Silesia, which has been the capital of the 
Silesian Confederacy. The Sidemore system is also part of the sector, but outside the claimed extent of the Confederacy. The Confederacy occupies most of the sector. Pre-annexation, a few systems of the 


Andermani Empire

 lay within the sector. Post-annexation, the Confederacy was split between the Andermani Empire and the Star Kingdom of Manticore. 







 Sol Sector


 
Old Sol is the star around which the Sol sector has been defined. The oldest human colonies lie within the sector. It is the heart of the 






Solarian League





. The League capital of 
Old Earth is in the Sol system and the planet 
Beowulf and the 
Sigma Draconis terminus of the Manticore wormhole junction are relatively near.






 Inhabited clusters 



This is a list of clumps of inhabited systems, and are not 
star clusters





 


Talbott Cluster




 The Talbot Cluster lies near the Lynx Terminus of the Manticore wormhole junction. It is part of the Verge, just outside the Shell part of the 






Solarian League





.







 Matapan






 Star Systems 



Manticore Star System





 Manticore Star System


 The Manticore Star System is a 
binary star system composed of Manticore A and Manticore B, containing three human habitable planets, 
Manticore, 
Gryphon, and 
Sphinx, and one native intelligent species, 
treecats.







 Manticore A (star)


 Salamander (Manticore-A I)


 A small planet orbiting very near Manticore A.


 Phoenix (Manticore-A II)


 a red planet


 
Manticore (Manticore A III)


 Capital world of the Star Kingdom and one of Manticore-A's inhabited planets.


 
Sphinx (Manticore-A IV)


 One of the Star Kingdom's worlds. Homeworld of the treecats.


 Draco (Manticore-A V)


 A gas giant.


 Roc (Manticore-A VI)


 A gas giant.


 Wyvern (Manticore-A VII)


 A gas giant.







 Manticore B (star)


 Erinye (Manticore-B I)


 Gorgon (Manticore-B II)


 Aphrodite (Manticore-B III)


 Damocles (Manticore-B IV)


 
Gryphon (Manticore-B V)


 Manticore-B's only inhabited planet.


 Unicorn asteroid belt


 Nibelung asteroid belt


 Titan (Manticore-B VI)


 Gorgan asteroid belt


 Fenris (Manticore-B VII)


 A gas giant.




The planet Manticore is the seat of government for the 


Star Kingdom of Manticore

, which long included only that system, and its three planets. The SKM now includes Trevor's Star (within the Republic of Haven and a terminus system of the Manticore wormhole junction), the Basilisk system -- another terminus of the junction -- (but not the planet Medusa in that system), about half of the now defunct Silesian Confederacy in the Silesia sector, and many of the systems of the Talbott Cluster in the Monica sector near the Lynx terminus of the wormhole junction.




Manticore Wormhole Junction





Manticore Wormhole Junction




The Junction is the basis of the Star Kingdom's well developed economy, and the reason for the growth of the SKM into something more approaching an Empire. The Talbott Cluster petitioned for annexation by the SKM because of the proximity of the newly discovered Lynx terminus, and Basilisk had earlier been annexed because of the Junction terminus discovered a few decades earlier. Because of the Junction, the Star Kingdom of Manticore now includes a disjunct (except through the Junction) collections of systems which, together, extend are 2/3 of the way around the Solarian League's periphery. The termini of the Manticore wormhole junction's include:





 Lynx Terminus, near the 


Talbott Cluster

 (the most recent discovery)


 Basilisk system, in which the planet 
Medusa is located (the next most recent and the first extra-system annexation by the Star Kingdom)


 Trevor's Star system, in which the heavy gravity planet 
San Martin is located. It is within the territory of the Republic of Haven, and was independent until it requested annexation after being liberated from its conquest by the Republic of Haven. 


 Hennessy star system, within the Phoenix  Wormhole Junktion 


 
Sigma Draconis, in the 






Solarian League





, near 
Beowulf. It is the closest wormhole terminus to the Old Sol system.


 Gregor-B, in the heart of the 


Andermani Empire

 (The Andermani owns the Gregor-A component of the 
Gregor binary system, Manticore owns the B component.)


 Matapan, southwest of the Andermani Empire






Sigma Draconis star system





Sigma Draconis star system


The planet 
Beowulf orbits 



Sigma Draconis


. Sigma Draconis has a wormhole terminus of the 
Manticore wormhole junction. The Sigma Draconis terminus is jointly owned by the 
Manticore Star Kingdom and Beowulf. Security for the terminus is the responsibility of the Beowulf System Defence Force.


The Beowulf system is a member of the 






Solarian League





. As such, the System Defence Force is nominally part of the 



Solarian League Navy


 as part of the Systems Defence Fleet, and forms a reserve force akin to the United States' National Guard. It is not part of the Solarian League Battle Fleet or its Frontier Fleet)


The Sigma Draconis terminus is the closest wormhole transit point to Old Sol and Old Earth, the capital of the League. Indeed, Sigma Draconis itself is relatively near to Old Sol and was one of the first settled colonies in the days of slowboat (ie, no hyperspace travel) colonization.


Beowulf is renowned for its medical technology, and for its tolerance of social/sexual behavior thought scandalous on some other planets. Beowulf has a strongly held 
libertarian approach to such matters. It is also where the 



Cherwell Convention


 and 
Beowulf Code originated.




Epsilon Eridani star system





Epsilon Eridani star system


Orbiting 



Epsilon Eridani


 is the planet on which the 
Epsilon Eridani Massacre occurred. The 



Eridani Edict


 was created in response to that incident. It is a 






Solarian League





 system.




Old Sol





Sol star system



Sol is the name of 
Earth's sun. It is the system of origin for 
humans in the Honorverse. It contains 
Earth, the planet of origin. 


Earth is the capital of the 






Solarian League





, and at the rough center of the sphere that the Solarian League encompasses. The nearest wormhole to Earth is the Sigma Draconis terminus to the 
Manticore wormhole junction.


Earth has suffered greatly in the history of the Honorverse, including the attempt by genetically engineered 
Ukranian Supermen to takeover in the 
Final War. 


Dating in the Honorverse is 
Post Diaspora, dating from the exodus from Earth's problems in the centuries before the Final War.

Weapons of Russia
Anti-personnel mines
Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union







PMN-1 anti-personnel mine (manufactured in July 1978) showing the arming pin 
in situ. Removing this pin arms the mine after a delay of approx 60 seconds.




The PMN-1 and PMN-2 (sometimes referred to as the Black Widow) are blast type 
anti-personnel mines designed and manufactured in 

Russia
. It is one of the most widely used and commonly found devices during 
demining operations. The PMN-1 mine is particularly deadly because it contains an unusually large 
explosive filling. In general, anti-personnel blast mines (e.g. the 



VS-50


) are designed to destroy all or part of a victim's foot. In contrast, a PMN mine can destroy a victim's entire leg (often requiring 
amputation above the knee) in addition to inflicting severe injuries on the 
adjacent limb which may also require some form of 
amputation. A typical anti-personnel blast landmine contains approximately 50 grams of explosive, which is less than a quarter of the explosive charge within a PMN-1. The PMN-2 also has a large explosive filling when compared to many other anti-personnel landmines. 


These mines are palm sized and cylindrical in shape. The PMN's has a 
bakelite case (brown in colour) with a black rubber pressure-plate and contains 
TNT explosive. Its successor, the PMN-2, is plastic cased (leaf-green in colour, but occasionally brown) and contains an 
RDX/TNT based explosive that is similar to 
Composition B.


Note: a significant difference between these two mines is that the PMN-2 (a 1970s design) contains a more modern 





fuze




 with an integral baffle beneath the pressure plate. This and the X-shaped design of the pressure plate makes the PMN-2 much more resistant to traditional explosive mine countermeasures, which use sudden blast overpressure to 
detonate mines. In contrast, the PMN-1 (a 1950s design) can successfully be cleared by such methods.


It is considered highly dangerous to disarm PMN-1 mines by removing the 





fuze




, unless they have only recently been laid and are in good condition. Even if this is the case, what appears to be a standard PMN-1 mine may in fact be the MC-3 version, which features an integral 
anti-handling device. Therefore, the standard render-safe procedure for PMN-1 mines is to destroy them 
in situ using a small explosive charge.

MC-3 - looks similar to the PMN-1, but has a small  blister  in the centre of the pressure-plate, incorporating a spring-loaded, pressure-release 
anti-handling device. The explosive content is 310 grams of 
TNT. The total weight of a MC-3 is 630g. An MC-3 requires a minimum load of between 5 and 6 kgs on the  blister  to prevent detonation. As a result, armed PMN-3 mines will always be encountered under some sort of heavy object e.g. placed beneath an anti-tank mine, to act as an 
anti-handling device. Note that detonation of an MC-3 under an anti-tank mine is liable to cause sympathetic detonation of the larger munition. Additionally, an MC-3 could be used as a conventional 
boobytrap device without being buried e.g. deliberately planted inside a building or vehicle.


 PMN-3 - looks similar to the PMN-2, but incorporates a battery-operated tilt-switch 
anti-handling device designed to kill/wound deminers. The explosive content is 80g phlegmatised 
RDX. The total weight of the PMN-3 is 600g. This mine has been encountered in 






Chechnya

Democratic Party (United States) by state
North Carolina Democrats




The North Carolina Democratic Party is the 





North Carolina




 affiliate of the national 

Democratic Party
. The current chair is 











Jerry Meek










 
http://www.ncdp.org/meekbio/, a Fayetteville attorney. The chair is elected by and leads the state Executive Committee, a body of more than 700 Democratic Party leaders and activists from all 100 counties, which governs the party.
http://www.ncdp.org/node/1526

Meek has used his position in the organization to rework the party's operations in the state from the ground up.  He has emphasized  precinct-based activism,  in which precincts would have a great deal of autonomy and financial support from the state party.


North Carolina Democrats scored impressive victories in the 2006 general elections, increasing their majorities in both houses of the 
North Carolina General Assembly and defeating incumbent Republican Congressman Charles Taylor.  In addition, most candidates backed by Democrats in the non-partisan races for the 





North Carolina Supreme Court




 and the 





North Carolina Court of Appeals




 were elected.


These victories came despite controversies surrounding 








Jim Black







, a Democrat and former 
Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives. The State Board of Elections ruled that Black's campaign illegally accepted corporate contributions and checks with the payee line left blank.  He pleaded guilty to a federal corruption charge, after denying charges through the November 2006 election.  He won re-election by just seven votes in a heavily Democratic district, but resigned from office in 2007.

Cities, towns and villages in Bahia State







A view of Vitoria da Conquista




Vitoria da Conquista is a city in 

Bahia
, 

Brazil
 which serves as a regional center for the smaller cities  Barra do Choca, Planalto and Pocoes. These cities on the plateau, all around 1000 meters in elevation, form the basis of a strong traditional coffee-producing region as well as a rapidly-expanding center for new businesses. 


It is the third largest city in the state of Bahia, after the state s capital, Salvador, and Feira de Santana. Its population, according to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) registered  308,204 in April, 2007.  



Climate



The climate is tropical and dry, moderated in temperature by the elevation. The altitude of the city  itself varies between 857 meters (2811  feet) and 950 meters (3116   feet). Precipitation from April to August is often characterized by fine, misty rain, while heavier rains fall from October to March. Winters (July through October) tend to be dry, with cold air coming up to  the plateau from the ocean and often producing fog.


Mean temperature varies from a low of 17.8 C (64F)  in July to 21.8 C (71F) in March. Mean rainfall ranges from 17.9mm (.7 inches) in July to 127.8mm (5 inches)  in December . (1961-1990 trends from Hong Kong Observatory).  


The vegetation ranges from very dry and coarse (1000 meters and above) to an array of grasses, ferns and palms in slightly lower elevations on the plateau. This is the coffee-growing elevation.  (MEDEIROS, Ruy H. A. - Notas Criticas ao livro  O Municipio da Vitoria de Tranquilino Torres, p.87)





Foundation


Vitoria da Conquista was founded in 1783, after several battles against the native 
Imbore and 
Mongoio tribes and 
Joao Goncalves da Costa, born in 
Chaves, 
Tras-os-Montes, 

Portugal
.


Costa had been sent to 

Brazil
 by the 
king of 

Portugal
, 









Joseph I








, to fight against the natives, conquer their land, and then 
convert them to 


Christianity

. He founded The Arraial da Conquista ( Conquest Town ) on the site of the last battle and began the building of a church in honour of the Holy Mother of Victory.


At the same time, Joao Goncalves da Costa ordered the construction of two of the main roads in the state of Bahia, one from Vitoria da Conquista to 
Ilheus and another from Vitoria da Conquista to River Jequitinhonha in 

Minas Gerais
. Today this second road has become part of a much longer federal highway known as the Rio-Bahia.




Business and Commerce



The major economic activities are commerce, medical services, and coffee growing. The city is becoming a universitary centre, mainly due to the establishment and growth of 
Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia - UESB 
http://www.uesb.br (Southwest Bahia State University).


The business atmosphere is energetic and in fullblown expansion mode. From larger businesses such as Grupo Marinho de Andrade (Teiu e Revani), Coca-Cola, Dilly Calcados (shoes), Umbro, BahiaFarma, Cafe Marata, to the smallest cottage industries, the area continues to attract strong interest.


The entrepreneurial Ymbores Industrial Center (Centro Industrial dos Ymbores) lies on the outskirts of the city with industries such as ceramics, marble, shoes, toilet valves, cleaning, bedding, and many others. Micro industries produce safes, candles, clothing, packaging, and hundreds of other products for local consumption and export.
As a business center, Vitoria da Conquista  serves the entire  southwest region of the state of Bahia and the northern part of the state of Minas Gerais.


The real estate market is also booming, especially around the fast-growing University.


Recent studies highlighted Vitoria da Conquista  as the city in Brazil with the highest number of new cars per inhabitant.

Obituary


EDWIN ARDEN DROPS DEAD


Was Famous Actor and Playwright of the 
American Stage


(From the 
New York Sun)


Edwin Hunter Pendleton ARDEN, who dropped dead yesterday, was one of the best-known 
actors and 
playwrights of the 
American Stage.


Mr. ARDEN began his dramatic career in the support of 
Thomas W. Keene in 

Chicago
 in 1882. He was born in 
St. Louis and educated in the public schools there. 





New York




 first knew him in 1883 when he appeared with the 









Madison Square Theater Company








 in  Young Mrs. Winthrop.  Later in the same season he was in  The Russian Honeymoon  company. He next went to the 
Boston Museum Company in the support of 






Edwin Booth





, 









Dion Boucicault








 and 
John Gilbert, and the next season found him with the 






Edwin Booth





 Company.


He appeared in a round of legitimate parts in 





New York




 in 1885 and from 1886 to 1895 toured the country at the head of his own company, which presented an extensive 
repertoire, including many plays which were written by Arden himself. Among his plays were  Eagle s Nest,   Barred Out,   Raglan s Way  and  Night and Morning. 


It was said that his father was an officer on the staff of 
General Sherman and later an editor with the 
St. Louis Republican, and his stage connection was said to have been due to the fact that his father was named as receiver for the 
Grand Opera House in St. Louis and ARDEN, then a mere boy, was detailed to look after the finances of the company then playing at the house. It was during this work that he met Keene, who took a fancy to him and offered him an opening with his company.

 and 
Mme. Simone were a few of the stage folk with whom he had been associated before the day came when the versatile genius of the legitimate went to the 
movies.


One of his most notable moving-picture engagements was in  The Exploits of Elaine.  Since his advent in the screen work Mr. ARDEN had done much work, both as a writer of plays and as an actor. He had been rehearsing during the last three weeks with  The Three Wise Men,  which is to open soon.

This article is about the sack in 
455; for sacks at other times, see 
Sack of Rome.



Geiseric sacking Rome



The second of three 
barbarian 
sacks of Rome, the sack of 
455 was at the hands of the 
Vandals, then at war with the usurping 
Western Roman Emperor 

Petronius Maximus
. 

In 455, the Vandal king 

Geiseric
 sailed his powerful 
fleet from the 
capital in 

Carthage
, up the 

Tiber
, finally sacking Rome. The murder and usurption of the previous Emperor 


Valentinian III

 by 

Petronius Maximus
 that same year was seen by Geiseric as an invalidation of his 
442 peace treaty with Valentinian. 


Upon the Vandal arrival, according to the chronicler 
Prosper, 

























Pope Leo I
























 besought Geiseric not to destroy the 
ancient city or murder its inhabitants. Geiseric agreed and the gates of Rome were thrown open to him and his men. Maximus, who fled rather than fight the Vandal 
warlord, was killed by a Roman 
mob outside the city. 


It is accepted that Geiseric looted great amounts of treasure from the city, and also took the Empress 

Licinia Eudoxia
, Valentinian's widow, and her daughters hostage. One of these daughters was 
Eudocia, who was later to marry Geiseric's son 










Huneric









.


There is, however, some debate over the severity of the Vandal sack. The sack of 455 is generally seen by historians as being more thorough than the 
Visigothic 







sack of 410






, because the Vandals plundered Rome for fourteen days whereas the Visigoths spent only three days in the city.


The cause of most controversy, however, is the claim that the sack was relatively 'clean', in that there was little murder and violence, and the Vandals did not burn the buildings of the 
city. This interpretation seems to stem from Prosper's claim that Leo the Great managed to persuade Geiseric to refrain from violence.


However, 
Victor of Vita records how many shiploads of captives arrived in 






Africa





 from Rome, with the purpose of being sold into 
slavery. Similarly, the 
Byzantine historian 








Procopius







 reports how at least one 
church was burnt down.

Company Overview

Medical Mutual is the oldest and largest health insurance company based in Ohio. The company serves its customers through high-quality, affordable group and personal health insurance plans, and third-party administrative services to self-insured group customers. 


More information can be found on the company's award-winning Web site at MedMutual.com 
http://www.medmutual.com


A Pioneer on the Cutting Edge


In 1934, America was in the depths of the Great Depression.  But in Ohio, a group of fledgling Clevelanders authorized a loan of $7,500 to start the Cleveland Hospital Service Association (CHSA), a pre-payment hospitalization plan to help people pay for their healthcare needs.  It was one of the first plans of its kind in the nation and the first ever multi-hospital payment plan.


Today, as Medical Mutual of Ohio, that same healthcare pioneer has been transformed into a multi-faceted company with health insurance at its core.  Through the years, the company's mission has not changed   to finance and manage benefits that improve the health and well-being of its members.


Community Involvement


Medical Mutual's mission   to improve the health and well-being of its members   goes hand-in-hand with its commitment to promote wellness through its involvement with more than 200 charitable organizations.


Flexible Products


Medical Mutual provides cost-effective access to quality healthcare for its members by delivering leading edge health insurance products and related services in a manner that enables it to maintain a strong financial foundation, and also, support the communities it serves.


Group and individual customers have a complete line of comprehensive, flexible benefit designs in which to choose.  Medical Mutual's SuperMed family of managed-care products include:  Preferred Provider Organization, SuperMed Plus; Point of Service, SuperMed Select; and Health Maintenance Organizations, SuperMed HMO and HMO Health Ohio.


The Highest Quality


Medical Mutual's focus on quality has earned the highest accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance , (NCQA) an independent not-for-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of America s healthcare.


NCQA has awarded Medical Mutual the highest levels of accreditation for the Company's PPO, POS and HMO products. In fact, Medical Mutual's SuperMed Plus product was the first PPO in the country to earn this status from NCQA.


To earn these accreditations, Medical Mutual has met rigorous requirements that focus on complaint and appeal processes, customer service, physician credentialing, utilization management and the infrastructure for quality improvement.  These areas have been identified by employers, consumers and others as being of special interest.


A Brief Corporate History


In 1934, America was in the depths of the Great Depression.  But in Ohio, a group of fledgling health insurance pioneers in Cleveland authorized a loan of $7,500 to start the Cleveland Hospital Service Association (CHSA), a prepayment hospitalization plan to help people pay for their healthcare needs.  It was one of the first plans of its kind in the nation and the first ever multi-hospital payment plan.


Today, as Medical Mutual of Ohio, that same healthcare pioneer has been transformed into a multi-faceted company with health insurance at its core.  Through the years, the company's mission has not changed   to finance and manage benefits that improve the health and well-being of its members.


It was 1926 when John R. Mannix, who at 24 was the youngest person to ever be appointed to the post of hospital administrator, began experimenting with the idea of hospital pre-payment.  His revolutionary idea was to divide the cost of healthcare among all people whether they were hospitalized or not.  Unknowingly, he applied the basic principle of insurance, and from it, sprang the beginning of a movement that would evolve into the system that we have today.


Eventually, Mannix led the crusade that led to the formation of the CHSA, which opened for business on June 15, 1934, in room 237 of the 1900 Euclid Building in Downtown Cleveland. Premiums at the time were 60 cents a month for ward service or 75 cents a month for semi-private room service.  At that time, the maximum length of hospital stay under contract terms was 21 days.  There were no age limits, nor were subscribers called on to take physical examinations to join the plan.


At the time, hospital service associations around the nation became known as Blue Cross Plans.  But it wasn't until 1939 when the non-profit prepayment plans officially came together under the Blue Cross identity when it came under the control of the American Hospital Association.


Medical Mutual of Ohio was created from two companies.   The first, CHSA, which was formed to provide hospitalization insurance, and Medical Mutual of Cleveland, which was formed in 1945 to provide insurance for the payment of physicians' bills.  


In 1957, the CHSA merged with the Akron Hospital Service Association to form Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio.  Then, in 1984, Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio merged with Medical Mutual of Cleveland to become Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Northern Ohio, combining coverage for hospitalization and physician fees under one roof.  In 1986, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Northern Ohio merged with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Northwest Ohio to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio.


In April 1997, the company re-claimed the name of one of its predecessors, becoming the present day Medical Mutual of Ohio.


The combination of an expensive healthcare market and a legal status that threatened its future forced the company to make a bold move in 1987, not only for survival, but also for the benefit of its policyholders.


The company proposed a change in state law that would enable it to contract with hospitals in a competitive manner.  The result was a memorable legislative battle that concluded in victory for all consumers.


In 1993, Medical Mutual was among the fastest-growing healthcare companies with a managed care product known today as SuperMed.  SuperMed proved beneficial to the Greater Cleveland Growth Association's Council of Smaller Enterprises (COSE), and later became a national model for insurance among small businesses, chambers and associations.


In 2001, Medical Mutual's SuperMed Plus was recognized as the first Preferred Provider Organization in the United States to earn Full Accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, an independent not-for-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of American's healthcare.


In order to keep Medical Mutual financially stable and growing, the company has expanded beyond health insurance.  As a way to leverage the company's vast computer systems, Antares Management Solutions was introduced in 1997.  Antares offers access to a broad range of technology resources and applications, which encompasses the installation and management of hardware and software for businesses in a variety of industries.  


Medical Mutual Services, another company launched to ensure long-term company stability, provides comprehensive third-party administration of healthcare benefit plans to companies nationwide, featuring the most innovative information system applications and technologies.


Despite the fact that the Medical Mutual of today is much more than a health insurance company, it continues to focus on its founding principles that were introduced in that small office on Euclid Ave. in Downtown Cleveland   providing the best service, products quality and value.

The Historic Rose Building, Headquarters of Medical Mutual of Ohio


The Rose Building, corporate headquarters of Medical Mutual of Ohio, is one of Cleveland's first steel-frame buildings and one of the city's many distinctive historical landmarks.


Completed in 1900, standing 10 stories high and covering an acre of land, the 380,000-square-foot facility was the largest and tallest office building in Ohio, and the largest outside of New York City.


Many Clevelanders doubted the building's viability, referring to the building named after Benjamin Rose as  Rose's Folly,  because they never thought business would grow as far east as the building's location at the corner of Prospect Avenue and Erie (East Ninth) Street.


Originally, the first five stories of the building were planned for a department store.  This intention accounts for the unusually high ceilings on these floors.  When a tenant for the floors couldn't be found, Rose operated his own store, Scott-Griggs Company, until his death in 1908.  The remaining five floors housed commercial and medical tenants.


Other tenants have included Western Union, the BF Goodrich Chemical Division, and the Forum Cafeteria, which occupied the ground floor for 50 years.  These tenants, and others, helped to fund the Benjamin Rose Institute, a well-known facility for elderly care.


An outstanding attraction of the early Rose Building was its lobby, designed around a circular stairwell 10 stories high.  Four open-caged elevators serviced passengers.  In 1928, the lobby was remodeled much as it looks today.


The institute sold the Rose Building in March 1984 to Medical Mutual of Cleveland, which is a predecessor company of the present day Medical Mutual of Ohio and a tenant since 1948.  Four months later, Medical Mutual of Cleveland merged with Blue Cross of Northern Ohio, which had also been a tenant since 1948.


At the same time Medical Mutual purchased the Rose Building, it also acquired the adjacent Sloan Building, now called the Rose Building Annex.


Built in the 1940s, the Sloan Building was originally an apartment building, and was later converted into office space.  It was even once occupied by Chef Boiardi, for whom the line of canned Italian foods is named. 


Originally designed by architect George H. Smith, the Rose Building has undergone several changes since 1900.  In April 1985, construction began on a five-year total renovation of the building under the direction of The Voinovich Companies, to convert it from a multi-tenant facility to Medical Mutual's corporate headquarters.


The first phase was to restore the building's exterior to its original appearance.  Subsequent phases included renovations and repairs to make the building more energy efficient and conducive to telecommunications and computer technology.


Today, the Rose Building has been completely restored to its original exterior.  It stands as a source of pride for Medical Mutual employees and Clevelanders alike.

Anime and manga terminology






Late night anime (      , shin'ya anime) is a term for an 
anime 
television series that air during late night or early morning in 
Japan, usually between 11 P.M. and 4 A.M. Sometimes the time that an episode is aired may be written in a time format with the hour larger than 24 (like 25:30 and 26:00), which is equivalent to 1:30 A.M. and 2 A.M. of the next day.



Overview



Late night anime is targeted toward 
anime fans or a teenage to young adult audience. One of the purposes of the late night broadcast is to promote 

DVD
s or associated merchandise that are planned for release in the future. Other than original stories, many anime are based on 
manga, 
novels, or 
video games. The genres that tend to be preferred by anime fans include 
romantic comedy, 
slice of life story, 
action, or 
sci-fi, but there are exceptions. Most series are broadcast for 1 
 cour  (3 months, 12 or 13 episodes) or 2  cour  (6 months, 24 to 26 episodes). With the exception of 








NTV







 programs, few titles have longer  cour .


In most cases, a 
production committee (a group of several related companies) buys a time slot from a TV station. This process is known as 
brokered programming, and is similar to how 
infomercials are broadcast. Therefore, unlike ordinary programs, production companies are 
sponsoring companies as well. This way, TV stations can fill the time slots with low viewership, while production companies can advertise their products (anime DVDs) at a lower cost. Since a production s purpose is to promote the title to fans, low 





ratings




 or a lack of sponsors is of little concern. Consequently, the number of late night anime is increasing. The fact that they rely on the sales of DVDs means that these anime are virtually the same as 
OVAs, except that they get a chance to be promoted. This is why  pure  OVA series have decreased rapidly.




The difference between TV version and DVD version



When a late night anime is released onto video or DVD, they tend to have their contents altered or expanded, such as:



Improved 
animation quality


Scenes uncensored


Completely new videos added, such as side stories or epilogues


Extras, like commentaries by the cast or production staff may also be added.


Such alteration often happens for television series, but this tendency is especially prominent for late night anime, because:



Production companies may not have enough time, or a large enough budget, to make a higher quality series in time for television transmission,


They often may want to include explicit sexual or violent content that are restricted for broadcast on television.


They have to add value for the DVD release, since they mainly rely on DVD sales.






Broadcast area



As of July 
2006, there are 67 late night titles being broadcast, out of 95 total anime titles. This number includes those broadcast by 
satellite and 
UHF stations as well. However, not all are broadcast nationwide. 



Tokyo


, for instance, has 49 late night anime series being broadcast. In 
Okinawa, only 3 of them are on the air.


In many cases, the title is broadcast only in the area of the station producing the anime (which, in most cases, is Tokyo). In other cases, they are only broadcast in Tokyo, 
Osaka, and 
Nagoya. 
UHF anime tends to be broadcast in Osaka, Nagoya, and 
Kant  region, but not in Tokyo. There are some titles that are broadcast nationwide, but such cases are the exception, not the rule. In other areas, variety shows with local 
tarento are often popular, making anime's entry difficult. This is especially the case in 
Hokkaid , where 
Yo Oizumi and 

his program
 are extremely popular.


If a household has access to satellite or 
cable television, the situation becomes a little better, because anime oriented stations such as 






Kids Station





, 

Animax
, or 
AT-X broadcasts many of those titles. However, their broadcastings are often weeks or months behind the first run. Moreover, satellite and cable television are not as common in Japan when compared to the 








United States







.




History



The earliest late night anime titles include 








Sennin Buraku







 (    , 








Sennin Buraku







) (
1963-
1964), 
Lemon Angel (        , Remon Enjeru) (
1987), and 
Super Zugan (       , S p  Zugan) (
1992). All of them were transmitted on 

Fuji TV
. Sennin Buraku was from the longest running manga ever, still published in an adult magazine called 
Weekly Asahi Gein . Lemon Angel was an 



adult anime


 that is a 
spin-off of the adult OVA 
Cream Lemon. Super Zugan was from a manga about 
mahjong. Those titles received some attention, but remained single experimental programs.


The title considered to be the true pioneer of late night anime is 








Those Who Hunt Elves







 (          , Erufu o Karu Mono Tachi) (
1996) on 

TV Tokyo
. At the time, several late night 
radio talk shows hosted by various 
seiy  were popular. As a genre, those programs were called  aniraji , the abbreviation of anime and rajio (radio). TV producers thought that if anime-related radio programs on late night can be popular, then anime TV programs on late night should work too. The result turned out as they wished. Because of this, TV Tokyo continued their late night time slots. In 
1997, the time slots were expanded, and they became the basis of the  late night anime  that we now know. At the time, following the immense success of 
Neon Genesis Evangelion (           , Shin Seiki Evangerion), the number of produced anime rapidly increased. Many of those titles came to late night slots. 
Nippon TV also started their late night anime with 
Berserk (         , Kenp  Denki Beruseruku).


In 
1998, Fuji TV restarted their late night anime. Also, 
BS satellite station 









WOWOW








 started their block with the complete version of 












Cowboy Bebop











 (         , Kaub i Bibappu), which had been incompletely broadcast in TV Tokyo's evening time slot.


The first UHF late night anime, 
Legend of Basara (Rejendo obu Basara), started this year as well. However, the true rise of UHF anime came with 















Comic Party














 (         , Komikku P t ) (
2001). In 2001, 
BS digital station 
BS-i began their time slot with 












Mahoromatic











 (        , Mahoromatikku), making the cute title one of its killer contents.


In 
2002, Fuji TV increased the number of programs that they broadcast. However, they did not value the otherwise filler programs with nearly zero ratings. Schedules of their late night anime became extremely unstable. For instance, when a program was on air at 2:25 A.M., the next week it was on air at 1:55 A.M. The week after, it was not broadcast, and the next week, 2 episodes were shown at 3:05 A.M. An extreme case was the last week of 










Kanon









, for which they broadcast the last 3 episodes in a marathon. Anime fans heavily criticized this attitude, and production companies began to avoid broadcasting on Fuji TV. The number of late night anime on Fuji TV has decreased, and in October 
2004, it completely disappeared. However, from April 
2005, they started the time block called 
Noitamina, the block aimed for a 
young adult female audience, who otherwise would not watch anime. However, non-Noitamina anime, such as 
Mushishi (  , Mushishi), still do not get a proper screening.




Current tendencies of the major nationwide networks













NHK General





, 






NHK Educational










NHK
 is the only 
public broadcasting station in Japan. They do not broadcast late night anime, except for reruns.











NTV










They mainly show anime designed for non-otaku audiences, but the titles still appeal to anime fans as well. Also, they show titles with many episodes, such as 
Monster (Monsut ). By starting 
Ouran High School Host Club (        ,  ran K k  Hosuto-bu) and 








NANA







, they now target female audiences as well.





tv asahi




They tend to broadcast at later hours than other stations (such as 2:40 A.M.) Many of their titles are original anime stories that are not based on other media. Their program can generally be watched by most people, without too much violence or 
fanservice. Examples include 
Kamichu! (    !, Kamichu!).




TBS



Some of their programs, such as 










Strawberry Marshmallow









 (     , Ichigo Mashimaro) or 
Rozen Maiden (         , R zen Meiden) are immensely popular among anime fans.


It is notable that some of the titles they produce are not broadcast on TBS, but on 
BS-i (a satellite channel affiliated to TBS) or on UHF stations. Such cases include 
Victorian Romance Emma (       , Eikoku Koi-monogatari Ema) and 










Fate/stay night









 (Feito/sutei naito).




TV Tokyo



The weakest network station among them, TV TOKYO always had to explore programs for niche audiences. Such genres include financial news, travel, 
jidaigeki (samurai fiction), outdoors, pets, and anime. Among major network stations, more than half of the anime titles are broadcast on this channel. As such, their late night anime are abundant with wide varieties.




Fuji TV



Because of the reason explained above, they broadcast the least among major network key stations in Tokyo, after NHK. See 
Noitamina for detailed lineups.






Censorship



Japanese TV stations do not have a clear detailed system of 
parental guidelines. The only clear rule is that they cannot show sexual organs. However, they do have many tacit understandings of self-restriction. Bare breasts, for example, are difficult to broadcast on prime time.


TV Tokyo once broadcast radical programs such as Evangelion during the evening. However, in 1997, they had  
Pokemon-shock , the incident that caused many children to feel ill by watching the Pokemon episode that contained many flashing lights. After the incident, TV Tokyo's self-restriction codes became much more strict. 
Now, TV Tokyo and Fuji TV are said to be extremely strict on sexual descriptions. Naked bodies are censored, and 
female underwear are censored as well. Even when a female character with a mini-skirt jumps, her skirt does not whip, which is often ridiculed by fans. These censorships on VHFs have become one of the primary reasons of the rise of UHF anime.




Rise of 
UHF anime



In 
Kant  region including Tokyo, the major nationwide network stations broadcast on analog on the 
VHF channels. The  independent  stations established to provide 
prefecture-specific programming broadcast on the 
UHF channels. They are members of the 



Japanese Association of Independent Television Stations


. In Osaka the situation is similar with exception of 
TV Osaka. (Note that all the Japanese terrestrial television are switching to UHF digital. In 2011, all analog transmissions on both VHF and UHF are scheduled to close.)  


However, because these UHF stations are obscure, they don't have strong restrictions. Also, their time slots were much cheaper than those of VHF stations. Avoiding strict restrictions by a nation-wide television network, and avoiding random scheduling by Fuji TV, many anime, especially those with a lot of 
fan service, began to be broadcast on UHF stations. This even more obscure method still proved to be fairly effective, and UHF anime time slots continued to expand, especially from 2001. In 2006, if UHF stations are to be treated as one network (which they are not), it now broadcasts the largest number of late night anime (16), even more than TV Tokyo (8). However, many shows suffer from lower budgets compared with VHF shows.


Because of loose self-restriction codes, many of the titles contain sexual or violent expression that is impossible to broadcast on VHF stations. Examples include Rizelmine and 








Elfen Lied







 (        , Erufen R to). (The latter title, however, was still heavily edited.) Nevertheless, as UHF anime continue to expand, they recently have more varieties. 
Sh jo titles such as 












We were Here











 (     , Bokura ga Ita) are now also broadcast. 










Princess Tutu









 (         , Purinsesu Chuchu), a show which can be watched by young children, is a UHF late night anime, too. As 
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (        , Suzumiya Haruhi no Y utsu) became a huge hit, UHF late night anime has lost the  cheapest, but the most obscure option  description.


Similar tendencies can be seen in other obscure channels as well, such as WOWOW, BS-i, and 
CS channels on 

SkyPerfecTV!
. It is notable that AT-X, a pay-channel on SkyPerfecTV!, broadcast Elfen Lied unedited.

Compositions by Karol Szymanowski
Stabat Mater settings
















Karol Szymanowski










's Stabat Mater was composed in 1925-1926 for 
soprano, 
alto and 
baritone soloists, SATB 
choir, and 
orchestra. The work is divided into six 
movements and uses 
Jozef Janowski's (1865-1935) Polish translation of the 
Marian hymn, 









Stabat Mater








:




 Sta a Matka bolej ca.. (Stabat mater dolorosa) for soprano, SA choir, and orchestra


 I kto  widzia  tak cierpi c .. (Quis est homo qui non fleret) for baritone, SATB choir, and orchestra


 O Matko  rod o Wszechmi o ci.. (O, Eia, Mater, fons amoris) for soprano, alto, SA choir, and orchestra


 Spraw niech p acz  z Tob  razem.. (Fac me tecum pie flere) for soprano, alto, SATB choir (a cappella), and orchestra


 Panno s odka racz mozo em.. (Virgo virginum praeclara) for baritone, SATB choir, and orchestra


 Chrystus niech mi b dzie grodem.. (Christe, cum sit hinc exire) for soprano, alto, baritone, SATB choir, and orchestra




Szymanowski's first composition on a liturgical text, Stabat Mater was written during his late 
Nationalist period of 1922-1937, characterized by his use of Polish melodies and rhythms.  Following a trip to 

Zakopane
 in 1922, Szymanowski wrote of Polish folk music:  [it] is enlivening by its proximity to Nature, by its force, by its directness of feeling, by its undisturbed racial purity.  1  Szymanowski's pairing of Polish musical elements with a 
liturgical text in Stabat Mater is unique, and a clear reflection of his Nationalist convictions as a composer.



 Origin and performances 



First commissioned in 1924, 
Princess Edmond de Polignac (1890-1927) requested  a piece for soloists, choir, orchestra (perhaps with Polish text) - a kind of Polish 
requiem.  2 Teresa Chyli ska indicates Szymanowski's intentions for the piece:  a type of peasant requiem - something peasant and 
ecclesiastical, naively devotional, a sort of prayer for souls - a mixture of simple-minded religion, 
paganism and a certain austere peasant realism.  3  Szymanowski and the Princess lost touch, thus the commission lost momentum.  However, later that year thoughts on such a composition were revived when 


Warsaw

 industrialist Bronis aw Krystall commissioned Szymanowski for a work in memory of his late wife.  In addition, circumstances in the composer's personal life also served as an inspiration for the work.4  Upon the death of his niece, Alusia Bartoszewiczowna, in January of 1925, the composer spent time consoling his sister in her loss, subsequently choosing to set the Stabat Mater text, with its profound reflection on the  grieving mother. 5  External circumstances also served as motivation for the work, including financial need, although there is no evidence of the composer receiving compensation for this work.6 


Premiered on 
January 11, 
1929 in 


Warsaw

, conducted by 












Grzegorz Fitelberg











.


Published by Universal Edition, Austria.




 Instrumentation 


Soprano solo,
Alto solo,
Baritone solo,
SATB Chorus, and 
Orchestra (pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, percussion, harp, strings, and organ).




 Polish Text 



Szymanowski chose to set Jozef Janowski's (1865-1935) Polish translation of the Latin 









Stabat Mater








 text.  Although the 13c. text is inherently dramatic, Janowski's translation is especially raw.  Kornel Micha owski indicates the composer's initial attraction to the Polish translation was a result of its  unusually primitive, almost 'folk-like' simplicity and naivety. .7  For a full English translation and commentary on the Polish text and translation, and see: Belland, Douglas Keith.  An examination of the Persichetti, Poulenc, and Szymanowski Stabat Mater settings with pertinent information on the text.  Dissertation:  University of Cincinnati, 1992. 




 Study of Early Music 


Coinciding with his composition of Stabat Mater, was Szymanowski's study of early music - encompassing  pre-Palestrinian  and 












Palestrinian











 periods, as well as a study of old-Polish religious music.8  Devices used indicating this influence include: parallel movement between voices, 
modal pitch organization, and strongly patterned rhythms such as 
ostinati.  Also incorporated into the work are melodic elements of two Polish Hymns:  wi ty Bo e [Holy God] and 
Gorzkie  ale 
http://acweb.colum.edu/users/agunkel/homepage/easter/eastgz.html [Bitter Sorrows].. 9




 Nationalism and Folk Music 


Influenced by composers such as 
Stravinsky and 
Bartok, Szymanowski began to incorporated folk music into his composition during his Nationalist period of 1922-1937.  In the years preceding the composition of the Stabat Mater,  the composer kept a notebook of highlanders' melodies that he encountered in his visits to the 
Tatra region, which were later incorporated into his compositions.  For example, his use of the Podhalean 
mode, an ancient Polish folk mode characterized by its raised fourth scale degree (
Lydian), can be seen in Stabat Mater. 10

There are a number of Spanish and Portuguese units of measurement of 
length or 
area that are now obsolete.  They include the vara, the cordel, the league and the labor.  The units of area used to express the area of land are still encountered in some transactions in land today.


Vara


A vara (abbreviation: var) is an old 



Spanish


 and 

Portuguese
 


unit

 of 
length.  Varas are a 
surveying unit that appears in many deeds in the southern 








United States







, and varas were also used in many parts of 










Latin America









.  It varied in size at various times and places; the Spanish unit was set at about 835.9 mm in 1801.  At some time a value of 33 in (838.2 mm) was adopted in California.


In 


Texas

, a vara was defined as 33 1/3 
inches.  The vara and the corresponding unit of 
area, the square vara, was introduced in the 19th century to measure Spanish land grants.  In 


Texas

, 







Austin






's early surveying contracts required that they use the vara as a standard unit.  An 
acre is equivalent to 5,645.376 Texan square varas.


Standardization of measurement in 


Texas

 came with the introduction of varas, cordels, and leagues.




Cordel


A cordel is an old measure of length in Portugal and its colonies. So named because a string of standard length was used to measure.




Labor


A labor (pronounced  in West 


Texas

) is a 


unit

 of 
area, used to express the area of land, that is equal to 1 million square varas.  A labor is equivalent to about 177.1 
acres or 71.68 
ha.  It was used in the archaic system of old Spanish land grants affecting Texas and parts of adjoining states.  The labor is often used as an approximate equivalent to a quarter-section (that is, one quarter of a 
square mile of land). It is still encountered in modern real estate transactions.




Spanish League (unit of length)


A Spanish league (Spanish: ) is a 


unit

 of 
length, used to express distances, that is equal to 5,000 varas.  It is equivalent to about 4.2 
kilometres or about 2.6 
miles.  Officially the league was abolished by 


Philip II of Spain

 in 
1568, but it is still in use unofficially in parts of 










Latin America









, with exact meaning varying in different countries. It was also used in the treaty language defining the Pacific Ocean end of the US-Mexico border after the war of 1846-8.


In 


Argentina

 a league is a distance of 5 km.


In 

Brazil
 the league has fallen into disuse, but it used to be described as equivalent to 6 km.


In 
Yucatan and other parts of rural 








Mexico







 the league is still commonly used in the original sense of the distance that can be covered on foot in an hour, so that a league along a good road on level ground is a greater distance than a league on a difficult path over rough terrain.




League (unit of area)


A league can also be a 


unit

 of 
area, used to express the area of land, that is equal to 25 million square varas. A (square) league is equivalent to about 4,428.4 
acres (1792.15 
ha).  It was used in the archaic system of old Spanish land grants affecting 


Texas

 and parts of adjoining states and this use of league is used throughout the 






Texas Constitution





.


A common Texas land grant size, discussed in 


James Michener's

 





Texas




, was a  labor and a league :  one labor of good 
riparian land, and a (square) league of land away from the river.


The (square) league is still encountered in modern real estate transactions.




Palmo and coto


The palmo ( palm ) measured the distance between the tip of the thumb and the tip of the pinky finger with all fingers splayed. Its standardized value is 20.873 
centimeters. Half of a palmo in 
Castille was called the coto, described as six fingers and defined as 10.4365 cm. The 
ancient Romans had a similar, smaller unit called the palmus, which was 7.3925 cm.

Wilson the Butler was a regular character from the  The Broom Cupboard  - the in-vision continuity which appeared in between shows on 
Children's BBC in the late 1980's.


The programme was hosted by 





Andy Crane




 and, later,

Edd the Duck







, but the pair were soon joined by Wilson.  Wilson only ever appeared as a pair of arms dressed in black sleeves and white gloves.  The remainder of the actor constantly remained off-screen.  Much of the humour resided with butler and duck fighting with each other.

NC 11 is one of the longest 





North Carolina




 
state highways. It runs north/south for about 190 miles in the state. 


 Route description 



With the exception of a stretch between 
Greenville and 

Kinston
, most of NC 11 is largely a disused rural route.  All other major sections are cosigned with more major U.S. Highways, including a stretch of 
US 421 near the southern terminus and 
US 13 north of Greenville.  As a through route, 
US 258 or 
US 13 travel along the same general directions, but appear to be better maintained and closer to major population centers. The central segment is mostly four lanes and divided, although not controlled access.




 Business routes 


NC 11 has two 
business routes.  The first travels through the town of 
Aulander and is five miles in length.  A second business route was formed in 2004 and goes through 
Bethel; this route is cosigned by 
U.S. Highway 13 Business and was created after a 
bypass route was constructed. 




 History 



NC 11 was one of 





North Carolina




's original 1921 
state highways.  The original routing had it running from 

Bethel
 to 
Kenansville.  A short extension north to 
Oak City was done around 1930 and rerouted in 1942.  During the late 1960's/early 1970's, it was extended greatly to its current route.

Species



See text





Cyrtochiloides, a genus of 
orchids created in 2001 by Norris H. Williams and Mark W. Chase, is designed to provide a small group of Neotropical 
epiphytes, previously included under a broad concept of 
Oncidium Sw., with a new, more accurate identity based on DNA. 


Cyrtochiloides is akin to the mainly South American 
Cyrtochilum Kunth, a genus described in 1815. After having found its species scattered in 
Oncidium and several other genera, recently Cyrtochilum received notable acceptance by botanists, primarily based on the molecular discoveries made by Williams and Chase, as well as morphological analyses carried out by Stig Dalstrom. 


DNA samples illustrate that 
Oncidium ochmatochilum Rchb.f. and several other species have only a diluted concection with the core of the Oncidium species. This new genus forms part of a well-supported clade including 
Otoglossum (Schltr.) Garay   Dunsterville, 
Cyrtochilum, the Andean group of 
Caucaea Schltr. (also previously retained under Oncidium as the section Cucullata), and 





Miltoniopsis

For other persons of the same name, see 
William Burton.
Sir William Westbrooke Burton (
31 January 
1794   
6 August 
1888), was a 
judge and president of the 

legislative council
, 




New South Wales



, (

Australia
).


Early life


Burton was born in 

Daventry
, 

Northamptonshire
, 

England
, the fifth son of Edmund Burton, solicitor, and his wife Eliza, a daughter of the Rev. John Mather. Burton was educated at Daventry Grammar School and entered the 




Royal Navy



 as a 
midshipman in 1807 and served in the Conqueror under Thomas Fellowes, a very strict disciplinarian and later a rear-admiral. He saw service off Toulon in 1811, at 
New Orleans in 1814. He later served in the Barham, Tonnant and Ortando, and visited Lisbon, Cadiz, the Canaries, the Mediterranean, the East and West Indies and China.




Legal career


Burton then studied law, entering the 



Inner Temple


 in November 1819, and was called to the bar in November 1824. He was recorder of Daventry in 1826-1827, and a puisne judge of the supreme court at the 



Cape of Good Hope


 1828 1832, and then transferred to the 





Supreme Court




 at 

Sydney
. In July 1834 he went to 

Norfolk Island
 to preside over the trial of some 
convict leaders who had mutinied. Thirteen were sentenced to death, but as no clergy were on the island, Burton reprieved them until their cases could go before the executive council and clergy could be sent to the island. He endeavoured also with some success to improve the miserable conditions of the convicts; Burton being a religious man, arranged that two of the prisoners should act as catechists to the others until clergy could be procured. Eventually both Protestant and Roman Catholic chaplains were appointed. Burton gave an account of the position at Norfolk Island in his book The State of Religion and Education in New South Wales, (1840). Two years later he published The Insolvent Law of New South Wales, with Practical Directions and Forms.


In 1844 Burton was appointed a judge at 
Madras, leaving New South Wales on 
6 July 
1844. Had this appointment been delayed for a few months he would have become chief justice as 







Sir James Dowling






 died in September. Burton carried out his judicial duties at Madras in a capable way and on his retirement returned  to Sydney in 1857.




Political career


Burton was nominated to the N.S.W. Legislative Council and sworn in on 
11 August 
1857. In March 1858 he was elected its president. In May 1861, on account of the council having insisted on amendments to two measures brought forward by the government, the crown lands alienation bill and the crown lands occupation bill, an attempt was made to swamp the chamber by appointing 21 new members. When the council met and the new members were waiting to be sworn in, Burton stated that he felt he had been treated with discourtesy in the matter, resigned his office of president and his membership, and left the chamber followed by several others. The house was adjourned, and as the session had nearly closed it was impossible to do anything until the next session. When the council was reconstituted later a compromise was come to, under which practically the whole of the 21 proposed new members were not again nominated; but Burton also was not nominated.




Late life


Burton went to England in 1861 and lived in retirement. He was blind in his later years and when about 90 dictated a letter congratulating 






George William Rusden





 on his History of Australia which had been read to him. He died aged 94 on 
6 August 
1888.

Synopsis



In a grand hacienda, near a coastal region surrounded by spectacular beaches, springs a story of love that is as willful and strong as its heroes... a story that begins with a challenge between two indomitable lovers and concludes with a love that defies the limits of greed, envy, and treachery. Fernanda San Vicente is a sweet and beautiful young woman who suffers a complete transformation in her personality upon discovering her lover's betrayal and her father's murder on the night of her wedding. As a result, Fernanda flees to the hacienda she inherited from her father; now impenetrable and filled with an immense resentment toward all men, she vows to rule over the hacienda and the town itself. She is accompanied by her ambitious cousin Federico (who had engineered several illegal business dealings using her family's resources and her envious cousing Marilinda, who had been having an affair with Fernanda's fiancee Mariano. Having arrived, they meet Aquiles Hurtado, the barbaric oversees of the hacienda in order to get what he wants. Still, Fernanda rules the area with an iron hand... until the moment she meets Arturo Gallardo, the only man capable of batling Fernanda for a stretch of land on the beach. Ultimately, Arturo and Fernanda fall victim to their own feelings, and the competition between them turns into a true story of love. But the love between Arturo and Fernanda represents a terrible threat to those who would take possession of Fernanda's land. Driven by greed, Marilinda, Federico, and Aquiles enlist the aid of Fernanda's mother Cristina, a woman who had abandoned her daughter years before and who had returned to the area after spending all of her money. Sergio, Cristina's young and ambicious lover, is included in their plans to destroy Arturo and Fernanda at all costs. But in the end, it is destiny that decides their fate and love that proves Defiant.

RoboCup Simulation League is one of four leagues within 




RoboCup



. It consists of a number of 
competitions with 
computer simulated 
soccer matches as the main event.


There are no actual 
robots in this league but spectators can watch the action on a large screen, which looks like a giant computer game. Each simulated robot player may have its own play strategy and characteristic and every simulated team actually consists of a collection of programs. Many computers are networked together in order for this competition to take place. The games last for about 10 minutes, with each half being 5 minutes duration.

Highlights''





Beverly Hills High School (usually abbreviated as  Beverly  or as  BHHS ) is the only major 
public high school in 

Beverly Hills, California
. (The other public high school in Beverly Hills, Moreno High School, is a small alternative school located on Beverly's campus.
http://www.bhusd.com/reportcards/Old%20Sarcs/MorenoHighSARC00-01.pdf#search=\'moreno%20high%20school%20in%20Beverly%20Hills\')


Beverly is part of the 





Beverly Hills Unified School District




 and located on 19.5 acres on the west side of Beverly Hills, at the border of the 





Century City




 area of 

Los Angeles
. The land was previously part of the 





Beverly Hills Speedway




 
board track, which was torn down in 1924.  Beverly, which serves all of Beverly Hills, was founded in 1927.  The original buildings were designed by Robert F. Farquhar in the French Normandy style.  The school also receives its funding from its on campus oil tower.


As of the 2005-06 school year, the school had an enrollment of 2,362 students and 100.4 classroom teachers (on an 
FTE basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 23.5.1



 Awards and recognition 



During the 1999-2000 and 2004-05 school years, Beverly Hills High School was recognized with the 



Blue Ribbon School


 Award of Excellence by the 

United States Department of Education
23, the highest award an American school can receive.45 

Newsweek
 ranked Beverly Hills High School as the 267th best public high school in the country.
http://www.newsweek.com/id/51671/output/print




 Student demographics 



In 2007, about 27% of the 2,362 students at the school are of Asian descent, about 4% are Latino and about 2% are African American. 67% of the students are white, a category that includes 450 students of 
Persian descent. 6 Most of them are 
Persian Jews whose parents fled the 





Iranian Revolution




. The 

Los Angeles Times
 reported in 2008 that 
Persian Jews make up one third of the student body at BHHS.
http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-persian15-2008sep15,0,7972368.story?track=rss


About 35% of Beverly's current student body were born outside the 








United States







, and 42% of its students speak a first language other than 

English
. Many of these students are of Persian descent. 
http://bhhs.beverlyhills.k12.ca.us/pdf/BHHS_profile_updated.pdf?rn=9738




 In the media 




 Diversity program issue (2007) 



For many years, Beverly has selected high-achieving students from twelve 





LAUSD




 middle schools on diversity permits in an attempt to increase the number of minorities enrolled. Selections have been made based on test scores, grades and writing samples. However, according to enrollment data for the 2006-2007 school year, seven out of ten students who entered the school this way are of Asian ethnicity. In April 2007, due to pressure from parents and activist 








Earl Ofari Hutchinson







, who criticized the school for not recruiting more African-American and Latino students, Superintendent Kari McVeigh agreed to extend the application deadline until April 27, as reported in the 

Los Angeles Times
 and the 
Beverly Hills Courier, hoping that more students from these minority groups would seek to enroll. According to the 
Beverly Hills Courier (May 25, 2007),  civil rights leaders hailed the final student selections  as  an honest effort to obtain ethnic diversity.  7 8




 Other media 



In the media, students of Beverly Hills High School are typically portrayed as absurdly affluent. For example, in the fictional version of Beverly in the film version of 

The Beverly Hillbillies
, Davids serve students gourmet coffee in the hallways.


Beverly has been featured in many movies, including 

Clueless
, 

Real Women Have Curves
, 

Whatever It Takes
, 
The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, and 

It's a Wonderful Life
,  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/locations, both of which featured a scene in Beverly's unique  Swim Gym,  perhaps the only gymnasium that has a basketball court that can split open to reveal a recreational-sized, 25-yard swimming pool. 


Beverly has been featured in cartoons, including 














Beverly Hills Teens













.  The French animated series 

Totally Spies!
 also takes place at  Bev High. 


The front of Beverly High is even shown in a short clip of Nickelback's music video for their song  RockStar,  although it only shows the part that reads  Hills High School  (the  Beverly  portion was cut off).


The gym in Beverly Hills High was used in the video for boy band 



NLT


's That Girl.




 West Beverly Hills High School 



Initially, the producers of the 1990s television drama 
Beverly Hills 90210 wanted the show to be set at Beverly Hills High School, and the show to be filmed on Beverly's campus. The Beverly Hills school board declined both requests, so the TV producers created the fictional  West Beverly Hills High School  (or  West Beverly ) and the show was filmed at 

Torrance High School
, in 

Torrance, California
.  West Beverly  is a clear reference to Beverly, because Beverly's campus is located on the western border of Beverly Hills.





 News services 



BHHS has two award-winning news services. 

KBEV
-Channel 6 is a student-run television channel that began in 1974 on Theta Cable as part of the PEG requirements for cable companies (free access by 

Public Access
, Education and Government entities in the community). KBEV airs the longest running high school news program in the country, The Norman Newservice (now The Norman News). Highlights, the school's newspaper, has also won awards for its reporting and writing. In October 2007, Highlights won first place in the 13th Annual California State University Northridge Journalism Skills Competition, with a total of seven out of twelve possible awards in news writing, feature writing, opinion writing, sports writing and photojournalism.




 Student life in 1980s 



Perhaps the most recent published book on student life at Beverly is Hard Lessons: Senior Year at Beverly Hills High School, by Michael Leahy (ISBN 0316518158). Published in 1988, it is a comprehensive book that followed Leahy's sociological study of Beverly students in the mid-1980s. In 1984, Beverly had a 100% graduation rate but three students committed suicide.  These suicides piqued Leahy's interest in Beverly; Leahy had  heard so many stories of excruciating academic pressure, cocaine abuse and drifting children  that he decided to study the school's student body by interviewing students, parents, and teachers. He followed the lives of six Beverly seniors from the day they started school until the day they graduated in 1985.


Leahy wrote,  It did not take long during my conversations with Beverly students before I understood that their world was nothing like the one I had imagined from casually observing teenage behavior in malls and at rock concerts. After that initial shock, the task became to listen to students long and carefully enough until I adequately understood the panorama of life at Beverly.  Leahy learned that in spite of the media's typical portrait Beverly was  not a den of hedonism.  Leahy observed that  Social attitudes and mores appear to be nearly identical to those found in the middle-class high schools of the 






Los Angeles Basin





 and the 





San Fernando Valley




   the evidence of 
drug and alcohol use no more or less high, the discussion of sex and 
birth control equally as obsessive. 


Beverly's academic and social pressures created problems in the mid-1980s. Leahy quotes a teacher who said in 1985,  The admired kid here is not necessarily the good-looking athlete. The possibility of success in the future is important to someone's overall attractiveness. Kids are already planning their law practices or where they might set up their businesses. Sometimes you can't see their problems through that act of maturity they put on for you. If they're not well adjusted, then that illusion can be a real problem, because some of them are facing pressures that they don't know how to cope with. Your whole worth here, in these kids' eyes, is determined by how well you're doing academically and socially. A 'C' is a horrible grade to them, a failing grade. Sometimes a 'B' is, too. There's been a lot of cheating. The anxiety is only growing worse. 


According to the 1985 edition of the school yearbook,  The Beverly Pursuit is the path to success. . . . One wrong move, and the student could be traveling in endless circles. Sure, he will have a chance to roll again, but he will have to take advantage of every opportunity. Sometimes a student will land in the wrong square, but he must be patient. Someday he will be able to cash in all his chips and reach the center of attention. Of course, everyone wants a piece of the pie. If a student does not have the right moves, he will go hungry. . . . 




 Athletics 






Beverly Hills High School  Swim Gym 



The Beverly Hills High School  Swim Gym  was designed by 

Stiles O. Clements
 and built in 1939 as a 
New Deal project. It features a basketball court that opens to reveal a 25-yard-long swimming pool underneath, as mentioned previously.  It is featured in  
It's A Wonderful Life  as the location of the dance. Sports including volleyball, basketball, swimming and water polo can all be played in this facility. Beverly offers the following sports:

BHHS's stadium is a multipurpose facility that is used for football, soccer, baseball, lacrosse, and track and field.




 Performing arts 



Beverly Hills High School claims that its Performing Arts Department is  nationally famous for the quality of its musical and theatrical productions and for its famous alumni,  and the school claims that the department  is highly visible in the industry, with casting directors, writers and producers attending performances and visiting classes to speak with the students. 
http://bhhs.beverlyhills.k12.ca.us/performing_arts/?rn=9087


Each year around late March to early April, the school hold its annual musical performance by performing arts students. Many of these musicals are based on Broadway award-winning musicals such as 

Anything Goes
, 

Fiddler on the Roof
, 

The Music Man
, 

Hello, Dolly!
, and 
Beauty and the Beast (Herb Hall, director) Last year, the Spring Musical was 
How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, and this Spring it was  
Les Miserables, directed by Josh Butchart. Every fall, performing arts students put on a dramatic play. In 2006, the play was 





Shakespeare's




 








Twelfth Night







,, directed by Josh Butchart, yet more progressive works such as 
The Laramie Project, directed by drama teacher, Herb Hall (who also played the principal in 

Clueless
) have been tackled by the students. This year's fall play was 

Inherit the Wind
, also directed by Herb Hall. In addition, the performing arts department holds smaller performances in the form of short plays.


BHHS also has an almost 200 member marching band. The BHHS marching band has had the privilege of performing at Disneyland for the past couple of years, after strict training in the skills of marching and playing at the same time. After several months of training, the band auditions in front of a strict jury of professional marching specialists. About 300 world-wide marching bands audition every year and only 20 get accepted. The BHHS marching band has gotten bigger and stronger each year under the direction of Richard Farmer.


BHHS now has a very successful competitive Winter Drumline.  The BHHS Drumline is in its second competitive season.  They compete in the SCPA and WGI circuits.  The BHHS Drumline has performed such shows as  A Tour of Technology: The Inner-Workings of a Computer  and  Censor State: The State, The Conceded, The Resistance . 
http://www.bhhsdrumline.com


Beverly Hills High School also has two award-winning groups, the Madrigal Singers (a 
chamber choir) and Minnesingers (currently an all-women's choir), conducted by Joel Pressman, a Beverly alum. Both groups have won a wide range of awards for their performances, usually at 
Heritage Festivals. They have traveled across the United States to well-known locales such as 
San Francisco, 

Las Vegas
, 





New York




, 

Chicago
, 

Orlando
,
Washington, D.C. and even internationally to 








Mexico







, 

France
 and 









New Zealand








.  Additionally, in December, both groups go Christmas caroling to raise money for their festival trips.  The groups were founded by Robert Holmes, who also helped found the Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts Summer Music Festival see 

Idyllwild Arts Summer Program



BHHS's Dance Company is renowned for their success in dance. They hold annual shows in January, which they practice for immediately when the school year starts. Last year, the Dance Company traveled to its sister school in 
Cannes, France, where they performed in front of many French students.  BHHS also has a hip-hop group, AP Posse, which also performs in between Dance Company numbers.




 Oil well 




An oil well on Beverly's campus that is owned by the Venoco Oil Company can easily be seen by drivers heading west on 





Olympic Boulevard




 towards 
Century City. The oil well has drilled most of the oil out of Beverly's campus and has been 
slant drilling under many homes and apartment buildings in Beverly Hills for decades.


As of May 2006, the Beverly Hills High School well was pumping out 400 to 500 
barrels a day, earning the school approximately $300,000 a year in royalties 
http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=1942646 page=3.


In the mid-1990s, an art studio volunteered to cover the well, which at that point was solid gray in color, with individual tiles that had been painted by kids with cancer
http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/archives/id/14356/. The studio created the design and drew the lines on the tiles, but children painted the tiles in between the lines. The studio made the design rather abstract: the design consists of random shapes on different-colored backgrounds. A ceremony inaugurating the design was held in 2001.


Beverly gained more notoriety when 

Erin Brockovich
 and 
Ed Masry announced having filed three lawsuits in 2003 and 2004 on behalf of 25, 400, and 300 (respectively) former students who attended Beverly from the 1970s until the 1990s. (The number of actual cancer claims filed in Santa Monica was only ninety-four
http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/2/umansky-muck.asp). The lawsuits claim that toxic fumes from the oil well caused the former students 
http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=10745 to develop 
Hodgkin's lymphoma or 
cancer. The oil well is very close to all of Beverly's sports facilities, including the soccer field, the football field, and the racetrack.  Beverly students -- not just athletes but students taking required physical education classes from the 1970s until the 1990s -- were required to run near the oil well. The city, the school district, and the oil companies named as defendants disputed this assertion, claiming that they have conducted air quality tests with results showing that air quality is normal at the high school. 
http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/04/29/national/main551421.shtml
http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/West/01/03/brockovich.beverly.hills.ap  In 2003, the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine published a  Community Cancer Assessment Regarding Beverly Hills, California  which failed to support Masry's claims.
http://www.usc.edu/schools/medicine/departments/preventive_medicine/divisions/epidemiology/research/csp/assets/pdf/BHHSreportfinal3.pdf


After receiving complaints about Beverly's oil well, the region s air-quality agency investigated Venoco Oil (doing business as 
Veneco, Inc) and in 2003 issued three  notices of violation  regarding the operation of the well. Venoco, Inc's penalty settlement included requirements that the company maintain continuous air quality monitoring at the high school, and prevent any oilfield gas (which is primarily methane gas) from being released into the atmosphere.
http://www.aqmd.gov/news1/2003/venocosettlementpr.html


On December 12, 2006, the first 12 plaintiffs (of over 1000 total) were dismissed on

The oil well may have inspired a 1991 episode of the sitcom 
Saved By the Bell titled  Pipe Dreams.   In it, oil is discovered at fictional Bayside High School in 





Pacific Palisades, California




.  There's excitement about the financial possibilities, but when a company comes in to drill, the character of Jessie realizes that it could be detrimental to the local environment. It may have also inspired a similar episode of 

The Simpsons
, namely the  Who Shot Mr. Burns?  episode. The strike oil, but Mr. Burns undercuts them, draining the oil for himself with a slant drilling project, which ends up destroying parts of the town. This, coupled with his actions later on in the episode, result in Burns being shot.


In June 2004

Emile Servais (

24 October 
1928) was a 

Luxembourg
ian 
communist 
politician and 
revolutionary.  He was an 
engineer by profession.

On 
9 January 
1919, a 
company of the Luxembourgian army revolted against the 
Grand Duchess 
Marie-Adelaide, and declared itself to be the army of a new 
socialist republic.1  The seventy-two year old Servais was chosen by an eight-member  'Committee for Public Safety'  as the new head of the revolutionary government, under the title of 'Chairman'.2  
President of the Chamber of Deputies 
Francois Altwies requested that 

French
 soldiers intervene, and, eager to end what they considered to be a pro-

Belgian
 uprising,3 France ended the rebellion and deposed Servais.4


He was the son of former 
Prime Minister 

Emmanuel Servais
.  In 1877, Emile was awarded the 






Order of the Oak Crown

Tonto Natural Bridge from underneath



Tonto Natural Bridge is believed to be the largest natural 
travertine bridge in the world. The area surrounding the bridge has been made into an 
Arizona state park called 





Tonto Natural Bridge State Park




, which is located off 
State Route 87, just 10 miles north of 

Payson
.1

This natural bridge was first documented by 
David Gowan, a Scotsman, in 
1877 while hiding from hostile 
Apache tribe members.  Gowan was impressed by the location and persuaded his family to emigrate and live there. 2 Gowan also tried to claim the land for himself under squatter's rights.1  


Gowan family members lived near the bridge  until 1948.  Their lodge building survives to this day and is included in the 





National Register of Historic Places




.

Baron Cullen redirects here. For the 1920 creation see 
Baron Cullen of Ashbourne.

Viscount Cullen was a title in the 







Peerage of Ireland






 created on 
11 August 
1642, along with the title Baron Cullen, for 
Charles Cokayne. On the death of the 6th Viscount in 1810, both titles became dormant. Although the issue male of the 1st Viscount thus became extinct, the titles devolved by special remainder upon 











Albemarle Bertie, 9th Earl of Lindsey










, who, however, never claimed them.1 They became extinct upon the death of 


Montague Bertie, 12th Earl of Lindsey

, in 1938.

Discographies




This article is about the fanproject of the German electronic music band.  For the fruit, see 
Tangerine.  
Tangerine Tree was a project from 2002 through 2006 that was dedicated to the collection, preservation and distribution of unreleased concerts and other audio material by the band 


Tangerine Dream

.  The creators of the Tangerine Tree project received permission from Tangerine Dream to release the collection on a strict non-profit basis.  Several of the Tangerine Tree volumes have been used as the basis for official Tangerine Dream releases.  The project collected just under 300 hours of material (291:39:26).

Material was collected from audience recordings, soundboard recordings, recordings of radio and TV transmissions and in some cases the purchase of studio masters.  Only recordings of a high quality and a unique nature were considered for the core Tangerine Tree volumes.  These recordings were professionally re-mastered and released on CD-R and accompanied by high quality artwork for the CD labels and case liners.


Tangerine Leaves releases were based on material that did not meet the quality standards of the Tangerine Tree or from concerts that were not considered notable amongst a series of concerts.  If a better source was found, a Tangerine Leaves volume might have been deprecated and replaced by a Tangerine Tree volume.  Starting from 1980, the music played during each of the shows in a single Tangerine Dream concert tour were very similar, so it was impractical to release many volumes of the Tangerine Tree with similar content.


Audio DVD Tree volumes consisted of about two sets of the Tangerine Tree volumes on a DVD that played to a slideshow of the CD artwork.  These releases were standard DVDs with a menu structure and were available in both PAL and NTSC versions.



History


For almost four decades, much of this material had been traded on an informal basis and many were sold as 
bootlegs.  Much was unidentified, misidentified, low quality and/or a multiple generation copy.  Tapes were starting to degrade, as many were as much as forty years old.  In the late 1990s, several collectors created the Digital Tape Tree project and distributed the material on CD-R.  Collector Heiko Heerssen received permission from Tangerine Dream as long as there was no commercial gains from the project and on 
9 January, 
2002 began to make appeals on the Tangerine Dream discussion group to gather all of the material together and create a formal project that would use the best available sources to provide the definitive version of each recording.1  A large number of previously unknown recordings were discovered and included in the project.  All of the Digital Tape Tree volumes were replaced by later Tangerine Tree or Tangerine Leaves volumes.


In September 2002, before Tangerine Tree set 3 was released, an interim Classic Tree was established for distributing copies of non-remastered already-circulating bootlegs. All of the concerts used in the Classic Tree were subsequently released as Tangerine Tree volumes in superior quality, rendering the Classic Tree volumes and the bootlegs they represented obsolete.


When new sets were released, standard audio versions on CD-R were traded by signing up on the project home page on a  blanks and stamps  basis where the only actual trade was of blank CDs and shipping.2  To reduce the number of CDs involved in the trade, the audio tracks were compressed using the 
shorten lossless compression format.


The Tangerine Tree project was discontinued on 
October 17, 
2006 by Heiko Heerssen due to legal concerns and personal reasons.3

Notes





 r  indicates a volume or part of a volume re-released in a later set, generally because a higher quality or more complete source was found.


 n  indicates a new volume that completely replaced an older volume that was deprecated.


After Tangerine Leaves 9 was released in set 1, a better recording was found and it was replaced by Tangerine Tree 53.  Tangerine Leaves set 5 released a different concert as Tangerine Leaves 9 to fill in the gap.


 TD  indicates official Tangerine Dream releases.


Decimals indicate volumes that have been split because they contain multiple concerts.  For example, Tangerine Tree 59 consists of two concerts in one volume and is split as 59.1 and 59.2.  


Concerts split across multiple volumes, such as Tangerine Leaves 10 and 11, are listed on one line.







Other releases


Other volumes are mixed collections of tracks from various concerts, films and radio interviews.

 Factory Girl  is a song by 


The Rolling Stones

 which appears on their 
1968 album 

Beggars Banquet
. 


It is very similar to an Appalachian folk tune, especially due to its minimal arrangement, featuring 







Mick Jagger






 on vocals, 





Keith Richards




 on 
acoustic guitar, Rocky Dijon on 
conga drums, 

Ric Grech
 of 


Family

 on fiddle/violin, 


Dave Mason

 of 



Traffic


 on 


Mellotron

 using the 
mandolin sound,  and 


Charlie Watts

 on 
tabla.
http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg sql=33:go120r3aq40z. 


On his performance, 


Charlie Watts

 said in 2003,  On 'Factory Girl', I was doing something you shouldn't do, which is playing the tabla with sticks instead of trying to get that sound using your hand, which Indian tabla players do, though it's an extremely difficult technique and painful if you're not trained. 1


The song is composed of lyrics musing on the singer's relationship with a young woman, all while he is waiting for her to come out to meet him;






 

Waiting for a girl who's got curlers in her hair; Waiting for a girl, she has no money anywhere; We get buses everywhere; Waiting for a factory girl''

 





Richards said of the song in 2003,  To me 'Factory Girl' felt something like 'Molly Malone', an Irish jig; one of those ancient Celtic things that emerge from time to time, or an Appalachian song. In those days I would just come up and play something, sitting around the room. I still do that today. If Mick gets interested I'll carry on working on it; if he doesn't look interested, I'll drop it, leave it and say, 'I'll work on it and maybe introduce it later.' 1


Jagger countered, saying,  The country songs, like 'Factory Girl' or 'Dear Doctor' on Beggars Banquet were really pastiche. There's a sense of humour in country music anyway, a way of looking at life in a humorous kind of way - and I think we were just acknowledging that element of the music. The 'country' songs we recorded later, like  

Dead Flowers
  on 

Sticky Fingers
 or  

Far Away Eyes
  on 

Some Girls
 are slightly different. The actual music is played completely straight, but it's me who's not going legit with the whole thing, because I think I'm a blues singer not a country singer. 1


The song has been performed live sporadically throughout the 1990s.  A live recording from the 

Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour
 made its way onto the 1991 live album 

Flashpoint
.  The song was also featured during the 1997 

Bridges to Babylon Tour
.

Botanical gardens in Georgia (U.S. state)
University of Georgia




Bamboo Farm and Coastal Gardens (52 acres) is an experimental research station and 
botanical garden located at 2 Canebrake Road, 

Savannah, Georgia
. The gardens are open daily, except holidays, without charge.

The garden's collections began in 1890 when Mrs. H. B. Miller planted three giant Japanese 
bamboo plants. By 1915 they had formed a bamboo grove, which drew the attention of noted 
botanist and plant explorer 

David Fairchild
. In 1919 









Barbour Lathrop








, a friend of Fairchild's, purchased the site and leased it to the 

United States Department of Agriculture
 (USDA) for $1. Lathrop traveled extensively throughout China and Japan collecting specimens for the garden; the USDA also collected and planted specimens. In 1979 the USDA closed the site. It was deeded to the 

University of Georgia
 in 1983 and now forms part of its 
College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.


Today the gardens contain more than 140 bamboo varieties, said to be the largest bamboo collection open to the public in 



North America


. Most specimens were planted in the 1920s. It also contains 35 
Palms|palm species in an effort begun in 1998 by the Southeastern Palm and Exotic Plant Society, as well as collections of 
vines and 
daylilies. There are two display gardens:





 Cottage Garden - a trial garden where 
perennials, 
annuals, and 
bulbs are evaluated.







 
Xeriscape Garden - demonstrates low-water landscaping.




Currently, the Bamboo Farm and Coastal Gardens is currently run by David Linvill, part of the UGA Cooperative Extension.

Happy Planet Index,  highest rank  to  lowest rank .




The Happy Planet Index (HPI) is an 
index of human well-being and environmental impact, introduced by the 
New Economics Foundation (NEF), in July 2006. The index is designed to challenge well-established indices of countries  development, such as 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the 
Human Development Index (HDI), which are seen as not taking 
sustainability into account.  In particular, GDP is seen as inappropriate, as the ultimate aim of most people is not to be rich, but to be happy and healthy.1.  Further, the notion of sustainable development requires that we have a measure of the environmental costs of pursuing those goals.2



 Outline 


The HPI is based on general 
utilitarian principles   that most people want to live long and fulfilling lives, and the country which is doing the best is the one that allows its citizens to do so, whilst avoiding infringing on the opportunity of future people and people in other countries to do the same.  In effect it operationalises the IUCN's (World Conservation Union) call for a metric capable of measuring 'the production of human well-being (not necessarily material goods) per unit of extraction of or imposition upon nature'.3 Human well-being is operationalised as 
Happy Life Years.4 Extraction of or imposition upon nature is proxied for using the 
ecological footprint per capita, which attempts to estimate the amount of natural resources required to sustain a given country's lifestyle. A country with a large per capita ecological footprint uses more than its fair share of resources, both by drawing resources from other countries, but also by causing permanent damage to the planet which will impact future generations.5


As such, the HPI is not a measure of which are the happiest countries in the world. Countries with relatively high levels of life satisfaction, as measured in surveys, are found from the very top (

Colombia
 in 2nd place) to the very bottom (the 
USA in 150th place) of the rank order. The HPI is best conceived as a measure of the environmental efficiency of supporting well-being in a given country. Such efficiency could emerge in a country with a medium environmental impact (e.g. 






Costa Rica





) and very high well-being (e.g. 

Panama
), but it could also emerge in a country with only mediocre well-being, but very low environmental impact (e.g. 

Vietnam
).


Each country s HPI value is a function of its average 
subjective life satisfaction, 
life expectancy at birth, and 
ecological footprint per capita. The exact function is a little more complex, but conceptually it approximates multiplying life satisfaction and life expectancy, and dividing that by the ecological footprint.  Most of the life satisfaction data is taken from the 



World Values Survey


, but some is drawn from other surveys, and some is estimated using statistical 
regression techniques.


The best scoring country in 2006 is the island state of 

Vanuatu
, followed by 

Colombia
 and 






Costa Rica





, while 

Burundi
, 

Swaziland
 and 

Zimbabwe
 form the bottom of the list.

Much criticism of the index has been due to commentators falsely understanding it to be a measure of happiness, when it is in fact a measure of the ecological efficiency of supporting well-being (see, for example, the following blogs in Heavy Lifting6 and 

Spiked
7).


Aside from that, criticism has focused on the following:  





That the 



World Values Survey


 covers only a minority of the world's nations and is only done every five years. As a result, much of the data for the index must come from other sources, or is estimated using regressions.


General suspicion of subjective measures of well-being.8


That the 
Ecological Footprint is a controversial concept with many criticisms.9




Nevertheless, the HPI and its subcomponents have been considered in political circles.  The Ecological Footprint, championed by the 




WWF



, is widely used by both local and national governments, as well as supranational organisations such as the 



European Commission


.  The HPI itself was recently cited in the 

British Conservative Party
 as a possible substitute for 
GDP, 10 .  A recent review of progress indicators produced by the 

European Parliament
11, lists the following pros and cons to using the HPI as a measure of national progress:


Pros:





Considers the actual  ends  of economic activity in the form of life satisfaction and longevity


Combines wellbeing and environmental aspects


Simple and easily understandable scheme for calculating the index


Comparability of results ( EF  and  life expectancy  can be applied to different countries)


Data online available, although some data gaps remain


Mixture of  soft  and  hard  criteria; takes into account people s well-being and resource use of countries




Cons:





 Happiness  or  life satisfaction  are very subjective and personal: cultural influences and complex impact of policies on happiness


Confusion of name: index is not a measure of happiness but rather measure of environmental efficiency of supporting well-being in a given country

Giles White (born 
March 23, 
1972) was an 

English
 
cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-handed leg-break bowler, as well as being an occasional wicket-keeper. He started his first class career at 

Somerset
, however, he is more noted for his career at 

Hampshire
, where he played for eight years.

Though he started his career as early as 1989 with 


Devon

, where he played in the Minor Counties Championship, even making a Finals appearance in his final year of 1992, and making his first-class debut against a team of Sri Lankans in 1991, which the tourists won despite a double century from 

Jimmy Cook
, his first foray into the County Championship came in 1994, where he played for Hampshire until 2002, even sticking with the team beyond their year-long excursion into the Second Division in 2001.


Having played extensively through the beginning of the 2002 season, didn't play a single game from August onwards, choosing to hang up his gloves, and leaving his team along with 






Jason Laney





, 






James Schofield





 and 
Irfan Shah.

Lorenzo Cozza (
March 31, 
1654   
January 19, 
1729) was an 



Italian


 
friar Minor Observantist, 
Roman Catholic 








Cardinal







 and 
theologian.


Biography





Cardinal Lorenzo Cozza



Lorenzo Cozza was born in 
San Lorenzo alle Grotte in 1654. In 1669 he entered the Order of the 
Friars Minor Observantists, in the 
convent of 
Holy Trinity at 











Orvieto










, taking the 
name in religion Francis Lawrence of Saint Lawrence (in Italian, Francesco Lorenzo di San Lorenzo). He studied 
philosophy and 
theology in the 
Franciscan convents in 


Naples

, 










Viterbo









 and 


Rome

. No information is available on when he was ordained 
priest.


In his order, he filled the positions of 
lector of theology in the convent of 





Santa Maria in Aracoeli




, lector of philosophy in the convent of Saint Diego (Naples, 1676), and lector of theology in the convent of 










Viterbo









, where he also became 
guardian. He then returned to the convent of 





Aracoeli




 as lector of theology and, later, in 1696, guardian. For five years, Cozza was master of Francesco Antonio Placidi, 
friar Minor and future Saint 

Thomas of Cori
 
http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19991121_tommaso-da-cori_en.html. Cardinal 
Giulio Cesare Sacchetti chose Cozza as his 
confessor and theological adviser, thus giving rise to a friendship that lasted through life.


Cozza was later appointed 
definitor of the Roman 
province of his order and charged by the 
minister general (general superior) with the 
visitation of the convents of 






Bosnia





, 

Dalmatia
 and 

Lombardy
. In the 
pontificate of 
Clement XI, he was 
consultor of the 
Sacred Congregation of the Index and 
qualificator of the 



Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition


. In 1704 he became superior of the Roman province of his order.


While in the 
Orient (1709 1715), where he had been sent as 
superior of the 
Franciscan monastery in 













Jerusalem












 and 
guardian of the Holy Sepulchre, Cozza found leisure to compose several important works. As 
papal legate he reconciled the 
Maronites and the 
Patriarch Jacobus Petrus of 












Antioch











 and his faithful, who had long been at disagreement with the 
Holy See. He was also instrumental in the reconciliation and union to 


Rome

 of 
Patriarch Michele Capisoli of 

Alexandria
 in 1713.
In 1715 he became vice-
commissary general of his order by 
apostolic brief of 
pope Clement XI.


In 1715 he returned to 


Rome

. In 1723 he was elected 
minister general of his order.
He assisted 
pope Innocent XIII at his death in 1724.
In the 
consistory of 
December 9, 
1726, he was created 
Cardinal priest by 
Benedict XIII, receiving the red hat and the title of 
Saint Lawrence's at Panisperna 
http://roma.katolsk.no/lorenzopanisperna.htm (a 
minor basilica in 


Rome

) on 
December 16, 
1726. Granted on 
December 9, 
1726 permission to continue as minister general of his order, he opted for the title of 





Saint Mary in Aracoeli




 on 
January 20, 
1727.


The remaining years of his life were passed in quiet and study in the little convent of 





Saint Bartholomew




 on the 


Tiber Island

, in the southern bend of the 
Tiber river in 


Rome

, where he died on 
January 19, 
1729, at 1:30 a.m. He was exposed in the convent's church, where the capella papalis took place the following day, and buried in that same church.

508 deaths
Northern Wei imperial princes




Yuan Xie (  ) (d. 508), ne Tuoba Xie (   , changed 496), 
courtesy name Yanhe (  ), formally Prince Wuxuan of Pengcheng (     ), later posthumously honored as Emperor Wenmu (    ) with the 
temple name of Suzu (  ), was an imperial prince of the 
Chinese/



Xianbei


 dynasty 





Northern Wei




.  He was a son of 










Emperor Xianwen









, and he often assisted his brother 










Emperor Xiaowen









 both in military and governmental matters.  After Emperor Xiaowen's death, he briefly served as 
regent for Emperor Xiaowen's son 










Emperor Xuanwu









.  Eventually, due to suspicions and jealousy of Emperor Xuanwu's uncle 













Gao Zhao












, Emperor Xuanwu believed false reports that Yuan Xie was going to rebel, and forced him to commit suicide.  He was later posthumously honored as an emperor by his son 










Emperor Xiaozhuang









, although subsequently 










Emperor Jiemin









 retracted the honors.


 Background 


It is not known when Tuoba Xie was born, but he was a younger brother to 










Emperor Xiaowen









 and was younger to all of the six other sons of their father 










Emperor Xianwen









 except Tuoba Xiang (   ) the Prince of Beihai.  His mother was Consort Pan, who died shortly after giving birth to him.  In 476, his father Emperor Xianwen (who was then 
retired emperor after having passed the throne to Emperor Xiaowen in 471) died as well, probably having been poisoned by Tuoba Xie's step-grandmother 

















Empress Dowager Feng
















, who then assumed regency over Emperor Xiaowen as grand empress dowager.  Tuoba Xie was considered studious and well-mannered in his youth, and was much favored by both Emperor Xiaowen and their step-grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Feng.




 During Emperor Xiaowen's reign 


In 485, Emperor Xiaowen created Tuoba Xie the Prince of Shiping.  During the years, as Emperor Xiaowen assumed more and more of governing responsibilities himself, he increasingly had Tuoba Xie participate in his decision-making.  In 496, as part of Emperor Xiaowen's 
sinicization campaign, the entire imperial clan's surname was changed from Tuoba to Yuan, and at the same time, Yuan Xie's title was changed from Prince of Shiping to Prince of Pengcheng.  Yuan Xie was apprehensive about having too much power, and several times requested to be relieved of his responsibilities; each time, Emperor Xiaowen refused.  Also in 496, Emperor Xiaowen, angry that another brother, Yuan Xi (  ) the Prince of Xianyang, had married a daughter of a servant as his princess, forcibly ordered all of his brothers to demote their wives to 
concubine status and marry the daughters of several high level officials, and Yuan Xie was required to marry the daughter of Li Chong (  ).  (As it is not known conclusively whether Yuan Xie had already married by this point, it is not known whether he was forced to demote his wife; however, the fact that he had a son who was older than Yuan Shao (  ), the first born son of Princess Li, suggested that he had a wife who was demoted.)


In 498, when Emperor Xiaowen carried out a major southern campaign against rival 





Southern Qi




, Yuan Xie was one of the key commanding generals, although it is not clear whether he saw combat.  Also that year, Emperor Xiaowen made him in charge of the imperial clan members' education (presumably of a sinicized education).  Later that year, due to the military expenditures, Yuan Xie proposed that he himself donate one-year salary for the war effort; in response, Emperor Xiaowen ordered a general one-third reduction in salary for imperial princes and dukes.  That winter, Emperor Xiaowen got extremely ill, and Yuan Xie personally attended to him in his illness, praying to the gods and their father Emperor Xianwen, offering to die instead of Emperor Xiaowen.  Emperor Xiaowen subsequently recovered from this illness.


It was during this illness that Emperor Xiaowen's (and Yuan Xie's) sister the Princess Pengcheng, not willing to marry Feng Su (  ) the Duke of Beiping, the brother of Emperor Xiaowen's wife 











Empress Feng Run










, fled out of the capital 

Luoyang
 and joined Emperor Xiaowen and Yuan Xie, informing them that Empress Feng had been carrying on an affair with her attendant Gao Pusa (   ).  Upon Emperor Xiaowen's return to Luoyang in early 499, he personally interrogated Gao and another attendant of Empress Feng, Shuang Meng (  ), and then personally interrogated Empress Feng as well.  Upon the completion of these interrogations, Emperor Xiaowen summoned Yuan Xie and Yuan Xi, informing them of Empress Feng's indiscretions and, while not deposing her (because she was a daughter of Grand Empress Dowager Feng's brother Feng Xi (  )), told them that he had no intention for them to continue to treat her as a sister-in-law, and they did not after this point.  Later that year, Emperor Xiaowen became ill again, and he made Yuan Xie his prime minister, with intention that Yuan Xie serve as regent for his son 










Yuan Ke









.  It was said that Emperor Xiaowen was highly irritable during his illness and often ordered attendants' deaths, but Yuan Xie would plead on their behalf and have them saved.  When Emperor Xiaowen grew sicker still in the summer while on a campaign against Southern Qi's key general Chen Xianda (   ), he told Yuan Xie that he intended for Yuan Xie to serve as regent, and that Yuan Xie should force Empress Feng to commit suicide after his death.  Yuan Xie declined the regency, explaining that this would bring too much suspicion on himself, and Emperor Xiaowen agreed, leaving instructions for Yuan Ke to, once his rule was firm, to allow Yuan Xie to resign his posts.  Instead of a sole regency by Yuan Xie, Emperor Xiaowen also, pursuant to his suggestions, entrusted the crown prince to Yuan Xi, his brother Yuan Xiang (  ) the Prince of Beihai, his cousin Yuan Cheng (  ) the Prince of Rencheng, his distant uncle Yuan Jia (  ) the Prince of Guangyang, and the officials Wang Su (  ) and Song Bian (  ).  He soon died, while still on the front, and Yuan Xie, after discussing with Yuan Cheng, chose not to announce the emperor's death but instead headed back toward Luoyang while summoning Yuan Ke to rendezvous with them.  They met at Luyang (  , in modern 

Pingdingshan
, 

Henan
), and only then was the death of Emperor Xiaowen announced.  Yuan Ke succeeded to the throne as Emperor Xuanwu.


During this transition, many people, particularly Emperor Xuanwu's attendants, suspected Yuan Xie of wanting the throne himself, but Yuan Xie handled the situation carefully and treated his nephew with respect due an emperor, and eventually the suspicion subsided.  Meanwhile, pursuant to Emperor Xiaowen's instructions, he sent Yuan Xiang to force Empress Feng to commit suicide.




 During Emperor Xuanwu's reign 


Emperor Xuanwu, who was 16 at the time of his ascension, initially wanted Yuan Xie to stay as his prime minister, but Yuan Xie repeatedly declined, citing Emperor Xiaowen's agreement for him to leave his posts.  Emperor Xuanwu, instead, made him the governor of Ding Province (  , modern central 

Hubei
), and initially Yuan Xie declined as well, but Emperor Xuanwu forced him to accept.  In 500, when the Southern Qi general Pei Shuye (   ) surrendered his city 
Shouyang to northern Wei, Emperor Xuanwu sent Yuan Xie and Wang Su to secure Shouyang and to assist Pei.  They were able to, and Emperor Xuanwu subsequently rebestowed the prime minister title on Yuan Xie, but had him take the post of governor of Yang Province (  , modern central 

Anhui
) and defend Shouyang.  Soon, he recalled Yuan Xie to the capital to be prime minister again.


In 501, over a power conflict between Yuan Xi and the general Yu Lie (  ), Yu Lie's son 
















Yu Zhong















, a close attendant of Emperor Xuanwu warned Emperor Xuanwu that the princes were too powerful, and that he should assume power himself.  Yuan Xiang also reported on Yuan Xi's faults and suggested that Yuan Xie was also too powerful.  In spring 501, Emperor Xuanwu summoned his princely uncles to the palace under heavy guard, and then relieved them (except Yuan Xiang) of their posts, and announced that he was assuming power himself.  From this point on, however, Emperor Xuanwu's government was dominated by his attendants and his maternal uncle 













Gao Zhao












.  In 503, Emperor Xuanwu recalled Yuan Xie to his administration with the honorific title Taishi (  ), but the title, while highly honored, carried little power.


in 504, Yuan Xiang, who was then powerful, was accused by Gao Zhao of corruption, and he was arrested.  He soon died while imprisoned.  As a result of this episode, Gao further suggested to Emperor Xuanwu to put the imperial princes under heavy guard, a suggestion that Yuan Xie objected to but Emperor Xuanwu accepted.  It was said that Yuan Xie was often depressed from this point on.  Late that year, Emperor Xuanwu made Yuan Xie be in charge of supervising a team of officials led by Yuan Fan (  ) in revising the empire's laws.  In 506, when the official Zhen Chen (  ) suggested that the state monopoly on salt be ended, Yuan Xie, along with Xing Luan (  ), opposed on account that ending the monopoly would lead to wastefulness and draining of the treasury, but Emperor Xuanwu approved Zhen's proposal anyway.


As the years went by, Gao Zhao grew increasingly powerful, particularly more so after his niece 














Consort Gao













 became a favorite consort of Emperor Xuanwu.  After Emperor Xuanwu's first wife, 











Empress Yu










 died in 507, Emperor Xuanwu wanted to make Consort Gao empress.  Yuan Xie opposed, but Emperor Xuanwu created her empress in 508 anyway.  Gao Zhao thereafter despised Yuan Xie.  When Emperor Xuanwu's brother Yuan Yu (  ) the Prince of Jingzhao rebelled in fall 508, Yuan Yu seized Yuan Xie's maternal uncle Pan Senggu (   ) and forced Pan to join his rebellion, and Gao Zhao used this incident to falsely accuse Yuan Xie of conspiring with Yuan Yu and rival 










Liang Dynasty









 (which had replaced Southern Qi).  Yuan Xie's attendants Wei Yan (  ) and Gao Zuzhen (   ), wanting to please Gao Zhao, testified against Yuan Xie, and Emperor Xuanwu believed him.  Later that year, Emperor Xuanwu held a feast and invited the princes and Gao Zhao to attend -- requiring Yuan Xie to do so despite the fact that his wife Princess Li was due to give birth.  After the feast, the princes were directed to bedrooms in the palace to spend the night.  That night, Emperor Xuanwu sent the guard commander Yuan Zhen (  ) to take poisoned wine to Yuan Xie, ordering him to commit suicide.  Yuan Xie initially refused, wanting to make one last appeal to Emperor Xuanwu, but Yuan Zhen's soldiers battered his ribs until he complied.  Once he drank the wine, the soldiers killed him even before the poison could take effect.  His body was wrapped in blankets and returned to his mansion, under the pretense that he had died from 
alcohol poisoning, although quickly the populace came to believe that Gao Zhao had killed him.  Emperor Xuanwu outwardly mourned Yuan Xie and posthumously honored him.

Do It All Night is an album by 





Curtis Mayfield

disco into his sound. The funk/soul basis of his music lent itself to the transition, but the results were tepid compared with his earlier work.

Satyabrata Rai Chowdhuri, 







FRAS






 (born 1935) is an internationally renowned scholar in 
Political Science, 
International Relations and 
South Asian Studies.



Education and Career



Rai Chowdhuri was educated at the 

University of Calcutta
 and started his academic career in 
Calcutta where he has taught at the 

University of Calcutta
 and founded the Department of 
Political Science at 

Rabindra Bharati University
 as its first professor and head. He later moved on to England where he was Professor of 
International Relations at the 

University of Oxford
, and Guest Professor of 
International Relations at the 

London School of Economics
, before joining the 
Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the 

University of London
, where he is presently a Senior Fellow in International Relations. In 2000, the 
University Grants Commission, 

India
 conferred upon him the Emeritus Professorship. He was also attached to the 



International Institute for Strategic Studies


, the 
Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses and the 










Stockholm International Peace Research Institute









. 


Rai Chowdhuri is a prolific writer who has authored numerous books and is a Asian Affairs columnist at 


Columbia University

's 

Project Syndicate
 and the Asia Institute of the 
University of California at Los Angeles, and 






Asia Times Online





. He has lectured widely, and his works have been published and translated into different languages in more than a hundred countries.


His outstanding scholarship in 
South Asian Studies was honored in 2006 with the 
Fellowship of the Royal Asiatic Society; 
UK's highest society in 








Asian studies







.


He currently divides his time between 

London
, 











UK










, and 
Calcutta, 

India
.




Important Works



He has been recognised in 

India
 and 
UK as one of the foremost scholars in 
South Asian history and politics. He has rendered distinguished service as an Adviser to the Indian Ministries of Defence and External Affairs and has played a role in 

India
's defense and foreign policy making. His academic and diplomatic contributions have been acclaimed as path-finding in disarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, peaceful resolution of regional and international conflicts and track two diplomacy. An avowed advocate for peace and stability in the South Asian region in particular, his writings have influenced the foreign policy making of many countries. In recognition of his expertise in strategic studies and Sino-Indian relations, he was offered an Ambassadorial assignment to the 

Republic of China
 by former Indian foreign secretary the late 












T. N. Kaul











 in 1998.


Among his books, the most notables as yet are Nuclear Politics: Towards A Safer World, and Leftism in India: 1917-1947 both published by 
Palgrave Macmillan in the 
UK. Both these books are known for the first kinds of works in the respective fields. 





Nuclear Politics: Towards A Safer World




This book won rave review across UK and USA as an important contribution to the literature of international peace and security. Nuclear Politics: Towards a Safer World deals, on the one hand, with the destructive potential of the  ultimate weapons  and, on the other, the ways of dealing with the problems these weapons might pose to international peace and security. The book helps both generalists and the specialists understand how the policies of nuclear-weapon states affect our lives. The book covers the period from the US atomic bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 to the twenty first century world and examines essential parts that both political acts and actors must play, if the objective is to eventually bring about abolition of nuclear weapons. The book will help the readers to easily comprehend contemporary factual details of  nuclear politics  and to predict the probable shape of things to come in the near future.






 

The work is aimed at a broad readership - teachers and students of Political Science, International Relations, International Law, History and Diplomacy, research scholars, policy makers, potential policy makers including those who would influence the policymaking process and also the common people. Since the work is confined to no particular nation or region, readers belonging to any nation may find it interesting and thought-provoking. This a pioneering research work. Books on international relations are legion, but I am yet to come across any publication on this particular area which may be considered comparable to Professor Rai Chowdhuri s work. - Professor Mitchell Reiss, Ambassador, United States Special Envoy to Northern Ireland; and Former Director, Policy Planning, United States Department of State.

 








Leftism in India: 1917-1947




Leftism in India, 1917-1947 provides a comprehensive account of the Leftist Movements in India during the most decisive phase of its struggle for freedom and describes how they interacted with the mainstream of the Indian Freedom movement under the leadership of the Indian National Congress, guided by its supreme leader Mahatma Gandhi and his ideology of non-violence. This ideology directly opposed those who believed in Marxism - Leninism and, little wonder, their policies clashed at almost every stage of the freedom movement. These clashes gave rise to the dramatic developments which are vividly described in this work. Each such development has been highlighted in its proper context, analysed with scholarly objectivity and supported by primary source materials collected not only from the Indian National Archives but also from Berlin, Paris, London, Mexico, Moscow and Tashkent.






 

Professor Rai Chowdhuri has to be congratulated on such a comprehensive coverage of not only the Communist Party history but also of Left movements in general in India. I also like Rai Chowdhuri s interleaving of the history of the mainstream nationalist movement along with a history of the Left. There are not many books which cover the same ground and Rai Chowdhuri s book, I am sure, will stay a standard reference work for a long time. - Lord Meghnad Desai, Professor of Economics, and Former Director, Centre for the Study of Global Governance, London School of Economics.

 Guard Corps, see 
Guard Corps (Haganah).

The Guard Corps (German: Gardekorps) was an 



Imperial German Army


 formation during the 
First World War consisting of Prussian Guard units.  At the outbreak of war in 1914, the Guard Corps consisted of the 
1st Guard Infantry Division and the 
2nd Guard Infantry Division, and was commanded by Gen. d. Inf. Frhr. 
von Plettenberg.  

At the beginning of the war, the following independent units were attached to the Guard Corps:



1st Battalion, 1st Guard Foot Artillery Regiment (I./1. Garde-FuSartillerie-Regiment)


No. 1 Aerial Reconnaissance Section (Flieger-Abteilung 1)


Guard Corps Engineers (Garde-Korps-Brucken-Train)


Guard Corps Communications Section (Garde-Fernsprech-Abteilung)


1st Machine Gun Company (1. Machinegewehr Kompagnie)


Soon into the war, at the 1st Battle of the Marne, the Prussian Guard was bitterly defeated in an attempt to take French Positions


In 1917, the corps was stationed on the 

Aisne River
 as part of 
First Army, and played in important role in the German defense against the 

French offensive
 in that sector.

/t/ and /d/ do not actually share the same 
place of articulation; /d/ is 
alveolar or prealveolar and /t/ (as well as /n/) is 
interdental.  Other coronal consonants tend to be prealveolar or post-dental.


The distribution for the 
glottal stop is allophonic, appearing only between like vowels, before initial vowels, and after final vowels.  It is also largely absent in normal speech


/g/ is 
spirantized intervocalically 


/z/ is actually an alveolar/prealveolar 
affricate [dz] and only occurs as a syllable onset.3  


/h/ varies between glottal and 
pharyngeal realizations ([ ]) and is sometimes difficult to distinguish from /x/




While Pazeh contrasts voiced and voiceless obstruents, this contrast is neutralized in final position for labial and velar plosives, where only /p/ and /k/ occur respectively (/d/ is also de-voiced but a contrast is maintained).  /l/ and /n/ are also neutralized to the latter.4  Voiceless plosives are unreleased in final position.

Mid vowels ([ ] and [o]) are allophones of close vowels (/i/ and /u/ respectively).  



 Both lower when adjacent to /h/.


 /u/ lowers before / /.  [u] and [o] are in free variation before / /



Reduplicated morphemes carry the phonetic vowel even when the reduplicated vowel is not in the phonological context for lowering.


/mutapitapih/   [mu.ta.'''p '''.ta p h] ('keep clapping').6




/a/ is somewhat advanced and raised when adjacent to /i/.  Prevocally, high vowels are semivocalized.  Most coronal consonants block this, although it still occurs after /s/.  Semivowels also appear post-vocally.7




Phonotactics


The most common morpheme structure is CVCVC where C is any consonant and V is any vowel.  Consonant clusters are rare and consist only of a nasal plus a homorganic obstruent or the glide element of a diphthong.8


intervocalic voiceless stops are voiced before a morpheme boundary (but not following one) .9 Stress falls on the ultimate syllable.10




Morphology



Pazeh makes ready use of 
affixes, 
infixes, 
suffixes, and 
circumfixes, as well as reduplication.11  Pazeh also has  focus-marking  in its verbal morphology.  In addition, verbs can be either stative or dynamic.

Veronica Loretta  Roni  Stoneman (born 
May 5, 
1938) is a noted bluegrass banjo player and former member of the 

Hee Haw
 gang having played the role of 
Ida Lee Nagger, the ironing, nagging wife of Laverne Nagger (

Gordie Tapp
).


She is the youngest daughter of 

Ernest V.  Pop  Stoneman
, patriarch of the 
Stoneman Family, one of the most famous family groups in early country music. Drawing on his Southern 
Appalachian heritage, Pop Stoneman realized as early as 1924 the commercial potential of traditional music, and carved a career from it. That year, he wrote country music s first million-dollar seller,  The Sinking of the Titanic.  The Stoneman Family won the Country Music Academy s  Vocal Group of the Year Award  in 
1967. After Pop s death a year later, Roni Stoneman, known as a virtuoso banjo player in both country music and bluegrass, pursued a musical career on her own.


In the 1970s, Roni reached a national audience when she joined the cast of 

Hee Haw
, the most successful syndicated program and country music show in the history of television. She picked banjo and sang from time to time, but it was the character of Ida Lee Nagger that made her unforgettable to millions of viewers.


Roni continues to entertain at numerous state and county fairs each year, and recent appearances include the UCLA Folk Festival, the Florida State Fair and the International Sport Show in Canada. Her CD,  First Lady of Banjo,  features various members of the Stoneman family.

Podded engine

Aviation terminology







Podded engines on a 

Boeing 707
.




A podded engine is a jet engine in a pod, typically attached below the wing or to the tail of the aircraft.  The pod itself is called a 
nacelle.


Placing engines on the wing provides beneficial 
wing bending relief in flight.  Early British jet aircraft had their engines buried in the wing root.  See the 
de Havilland Comet, the 
V bombers and the 

Hawker Siddeley Nimrod
.  The further the engines are away from the 
fuselage the greater the wing bending relief so engines buried in the wing root provide little relief.  Almost all modern large jet airplanes use engines in pods located a significant distance from the wing root for substantial wing bending relief.  The pods are in front of the wing to help avoid 
flutter of the wing which, in turn, allows a much lighter wing structure.  Locating the pod below the wing provides each engine with air undisturbed by the 
fuselage or wing.  The wing also blocks some engine noise from reaching the aircraft cabin.


Smaller jet airplanes which are not suited to podded engines below the wing because they would be too close to the ground commonly have two podded engines located at the rear of the 
fuselage.  For example, see the 

Cessna Citation
.  This mounting location provides no 
wing bending relief but, following an engine failure, does have much less asymmetric thrust than a wing-mounted engine.  Careful examination of such engines will show them typically mounted nose-high.  These engines are mounted to face the local flow of air, and the local airflow at the airplane's tail is descending.


As unusual counter-examples, the 

VFW-614
 and the 
Hondajet place the podded engines above the wings.  The 

Antonov An-72
 and the 

Boeing YC-14
 also place their engines above the wings, mounted very close to the wing.  This placement utilizes the 
Coand  effect allowing a lower minimum flight speed and decreasing the amount of runway needed for takeoff and landing (i.e. 
STOL).


Modern jet fighters almost never use podded engines, instead typically embedding the engines within the fuselage.  This was not true of earlier designs, however.  The 

Messerschmitt Me 262
, for example, used under-wing pod mounted engines. The Bell 

P-59 Airacomet
 used engines mounted in pods tucked up against the fuselage.



 Advantages 






 Podded engines on the wings can act as 
vortex generators.


 Podded engines can be located significantly outboard on the wing, where the wing thickness is too small to accommodate a buried engine.  The further outboard, the greater the 
wing bending relief.


 Podded engines in front of the wing provide maximum resistance to 
flutter of the wing. This is why almost all of the engine pod is located ahead of the leading edge of the wing.


 Podded engines can ease maintenance access.


 Podded engines can reduce noise within the cabin (since the engines are farther from the cabin, and for engines mounted below the wing, the wing itself acts as a noise shield).


 It is often easier to change engine models when the engine is in a pod.  For example, the 

Boeing 747
 uses engines from 
GE, 
Pratt and Whitney, and 

Rolls Royce
, the changes being mostly isolated to the pods themselves.


 If a podded engine explodes, catches fire, or breaks free from its mounts, it is less likely to critically damage the aircraft than an engine embedded within the airframe. Although such events seldom happen to modern jet engines, this possibility helps explain why podded engines are commonly used on commercial and 
general aviation aircraft that may carry fare-paying passengers. Military combat jets are often occupied only by crewmembers who can 
bail out of the craft in an emergency, making this safety factor less crucial. 






 Disadvantages 





 Podded engines can increase drag.


 A podded engine hanging low from a wing can suffer more damage from foreign objects (i.e., objects can get sucked into a low-hanging jet).


 In a ditching or 
water landing, podded engines hanging from the wing increase the stress on the wing by increasing the amount of drag caused by the water. This can cause the wings to shear off or flip the aircraft and destroy the fuselage as happened to 

Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961
.






 Examples 





A 

Cessna Citation
 uses two engines podded in the rear.








 Examples of non-podded engines 





The 

De Havilland Comet
 used engines embedded within the wing.






The 
F-16 Fighting Falcon uses a turbofan engine embedded in the fuselage.

The General's forces wiped out the family through the years leaving Marty the sole blood heir to the family legacy.  Their ancestral home is a huge fortress surrounded by bamboo forest. Underneath the home is the family's ancestral training ground that includes wood training drones and tests to hone the family's martial arts skills. The home has fallen into great disrepair since the death of Marty's father.





Eon   Eon was the hero who ended the Second Robot War by destroying the General, but unfortunately he died in the process. His weapon, later called the fist of Eon, was passed down through his family for 100 years. 







 Marty   Marty is the lead character of the series.  While scavenging for robot parts to sell he finds the fist of Eon and puts it on, although unwillingly.  Marty later discovers that he is a direct descendant of Eon, who 100 years prior to the series start defeated the General and ended the Robot War. Endowed with the power of the fist he must fight the evil forces of the general. He was originally named Iron kid in the original Korean version. Marty is the last descendant of the Eon family and is also the last heir of Eon. He is the final carrier of the Fist. He's shown to possess a natural talent for fighting, and grow stronger as the series goes on. He resembles 
Mega Man.







 Gaff   An ancient robot who has served the Eon family for more than 130 years. He safeguarded the fist for one hundred years until its successor, Marty was found. Somewhat a mentor to Marty and has watched over the Eon family for years and defended the family from the general's forces as best he could. His weapon is a sword.







Master Zhang   An unofficial member of the Eon family Master Zhang waited for the fist's successor at the family's ancestral home. He is a martial artist master who has trained several generations of the Eon family. Although he is quite old he is still a formidable teacher and opponent but can be quite silly.







Charlie   Charlie is another unofficial member of the Eon family. In flashbacks it is revealed that he was a servant of the Eon family and a close friend of Marty's real father. During an attack he flees with Marty and raises him as his own, per his real father's instructions.  His current location is unknown because he was captured by Black Beauty shortly after Marty flees to Crystal City.






Marty's friends






 Ally   A mysterious girl who runs into Marty and becomes his ally. She is the adoptive daughter of Duke Von Rhymer. She has the ability to read and decipher the computer code that was used to make the General and other robotic creations during that time. Most of her life has been spent in the Iron Tower, but she quickly adapts to the outside world and becomes Marty's close friend.







 Buttons   Marty's robotic dog and good friend. He constantly talks too much and provides great comic relief.






Government Central Defence Force (CDF)






 Captain Magnum   The leader of a group of soldiers in the Central Federation Army. He and his troops wear blue armor. He brought Marty to the government's attention. His weapons are a pair of cannons mounted in his arms and a set of missiles hidden within his upper body armor.







 Violet   A special agent and spy for the CDF.  She infiltrates the Iron Tower and discovers the General's resurrection. She later tutors Ally and becomes her good friend and surrogate big sister.







 Shadow   A rehabilitated criminal who now works for the CDF. He has 108 combat weapons and is an expert at covert-ops. He was reprogrammed after an 18 month hunt for him, only Captain Magma was able to subdue him. He is 99% loyal as he sometimes forgets which side he is on and could constantly change.







 Chief Gibson   The leader of the CDF.  He is the one in charge of all the operations and duties of the soldiers and makes all the decisions about what to do, although sometimes his decisions come too late.  Has access to vault where the General's mechanical heart is stored in the top floor







 Kelly   Chief Gibson's secretary and right-hand woman.  She does all the research for Chief Gibson and is the main speaker who briefs the leaders of the CDF forces in enemy tactics and strategy.







The General's Forces






 General   The General was the ultimate robot in his day who ended the first Robot War that involved the Gigantors. He was created by a pooling of the world's greatest technology around a supernatural human brain. The experiment was a success, but the General started the Second Robot War when he decided robots were superior and he should rule. The Second Robot War ended with his defeat 100 years before the series began when Eon used his mighty fist to destroy him in a suicide attack. Unfortunately the General's brain survived and was saved by his followers. Since his defeat his followers have worked in secret to collect his many pieces and rebuild him so that they can once again take over the world. However, since his defeat, the General lost his sense of honor and resorted to more harsh methods like using the very Gigantor he was build to destroy.He has a red coating which is so powerful even light cannot enter it.Finally Marty with his fist of eon defeats him.







 Doctor Chen   An evil man who was a CDF scientist who secretly left the organization with the General's brain. Years later, Chen personally spearheads the General's reconstruction, later becoming his chief strategist when he sets out to take over the world.







 Kahn   Kahn is second in command only to the General himself, following him out of honor. During the Robot War he was unstoppable, taking out an entire Federation battalion alone. He acts as leader to the General's forces after his defeat until he is rebuilt, with Kahn horrified of his leader's new outlook. He mainly battles using his fighting skills and brute strength, but is also capable of creating winds that pull or push his enemies, and can fire a set of rockets from his hand.







 The Four Invincible Lords;  The four invincible lords are four of the General's most powerful allies. They are each named after a weather condition; Lightning, Rain, Wind, and Cloud. They are quite large and carry abilities that link them to their names. They each are designed with gold colored amour and a red and orange flame patterned loincloths. There is one female robot and three males. Combined they can create a powerful storm.







 Black Beauty   A 
kunoichi robot whose main goal is to take the Fist of Eon from Marty and is a rival to Gaff. She was at the General's side during the Robot War and never let a target escape. She leads a army of black armored ninja robots.







 Scar   Scar was one of the General's most trusted fighters during the Robot Wars, a rival of Black Beauty's in rank and his own personal lackies. His past is shrouded in mystery and no one knows where he came from. He carries two large axes that he uses for battle. He is also equipped with battle claws that have an organic toxin that he uses is close combat against other robots. He was eventually defeated for good by Marty while he was under the influence of the Fist of Eon.







 Eiger   Eiger is an enormous robot who was the General's most powerful warriors. He was encased in ice by Eon 100 years ago. As a statue of ice he is easily recognizable at the entrance to the Temple of the Iron Soul in the Mystic Glacier. When Marty comes near the glacier the ice is melted from the sheer power of the fist, with Eiger attacking Marty under the assumption that he was Eon. But in the end, Marty defeats him.







Centaurs   Centaurs are the main component of the General's army. They are called his cavalry and resemble their mythological counterparts and are lead by one with golden armor.






Other villains





 Duke Von Rhymer  The evil chairman of the Iron Tower and Ally's stepfather. He was secretly helping Chen in rebuilding the General while carrying his own agenda involving the Gigantor. However, Von Rhymer was betrayed by Chen once the Gigantor is operational and ends up incarcerated in CDF.







 SteelJaw Jack   A robot created by Doctor Chen who currently sits atop the governments most wanted list as a hired mercany. He is an accomplished fighter and has no match in the government forces. Though he overpowered Marty when he was sent to bring Ally back to the Iron Tower, SteelJaw Jack is defeated by the boy in their rematch.






Others






Orange Mama   Orange Mama is the leader of the Orange Bandit, a group of outlaw robots that ravage the desert.







George   A former robot fighting champion who helped Marty and Ally through the Orange Valley.







Jenny   Orange Mama's granddaughter and friend to Ally.







The Bullybots  These three robots are trying to become master thieves after Espinoza and lead the good life. The group consists of Och, Tito, and Waddy. They are following Marty to try and steal the fist of Eon. They consider Buttons their boss, after he defeated them in a quick sparring match, and help out Marty and Buttons in the future.







The White Monks  A group of small robots that guard the Temple of the Iron Soul. They worship Eiger and believe a very different story about him. They believe that he is Eiger the Patient, who 100 years ago, roamed the glaciers in search of enlightenment. He came to a stop at the Temple of the Iron Soul and has since waited.

Two 
clarinet mouthpieces with ligatures. On the left, a well-used silver 


Vandoren

 Optimum ligature (with interchangeable plates), and on the right, a well-used naugahyde Rovner wrap-around ligature. Both are displayed without reeds.




A ligature is a device which holds a 
reed on to the 
mouthpiece of some 
woodwind instruments such as the 
saxophone and 
clarinet. On early clarinets the reed was instead secured by wrapping it with string, and this method is still preferred by most German clarinetists.   Modern German mouthpieces have a groove cut into the outside of the mouthpiece to facilitate wrapping with a string ligature.   


Ligatures are most commonly made out of metal, such as brass, and can be plated in nickel, silver, gold, rhodium, etc. Some players feel that a ligature plated with an exotic metal sounds better than a plain brass one. The more a ligature comes in contact with the reed, the  darker  the sound is. The less it comes into contact with the reed, the  lighter  the sound is.


Ligatures are also made out of wire, wire mesh, 
plastic, 
naugahyde, string, or 
leather. Dozens of styles and materials of ligatures are available today.

Cloud Peak Glacier is located in the 
Bighorn Mountains in the northcentral section of the 








U.S. state







 of 

Wyoming
.1 Centered within the 

Cloud Peak Wilderness
 of 

Bighorn National Forest
, Cloud Peak Glacier is the only active glacier in the Bighorn Mountains.2 The glacier is in a deep 
cirque immediately northeast of 

Cloud Peak
, the highest peak in the Bighorn Mountains.

Cloud Peak Glacier is retreating rapidly and is expected to disappear entirely sometime between the years 2020 and 2034. Photographs taken in 1905 and again in 2005 demonstrated an obvious reduction in the area the glacier, and more ominously, a huge loss of thickness. Between 1905 and 2005, the glacier has been reduced in size from an estimated 506 million cubic feet (14,300,000 cubic meter) to 78 million cubic feet (2,200,000 cubic meter).2

 Summary 






Nick

 takes the lead on a case where in the house a family of four, three pools of blood are found. Nick thinks that the little girl may still be alive, but 














Sara













 is doubtful, thinking that Nick's recent near-death experience is affecting his judgement. Throughout this episode we see a more nurturing side to Sara Sidle as she tries to help her friend cope not only with this particular case, but with his experience being buried alive the previous year. Nick finds the little girl on a river bank with her throat slit half way showing that her attacker was hesitant to hurt her. The girl is still alive and Nick stays by her side while she is in the hospital and tells her what has happened to her family. Nick shows great compassion to save her given his molestation when he was a young child. Nick really tries his hardest to help save young children from killers.

Sang Doo! Let's Go To School




Sang Doo! Let's Go To School (   ,     ! ; Sangdooya, hakgyo kaja!), aka Let's Go, Sangdoo, is a 16-episode 

South Korea
n television drama broadcast in 
2003, starring singer 
Rain.


Storyline


Live life to its fullest! 


27-year-old Sang Doo shows us his way to live his life to the fullest, even in times of adversity. Sang Doo was put in jail for fighting with a man who tried to pick on his first love, Eun Hwan. Eun Hwan's mother had run off with the neighbor's money, and the neighbors came to take all their furniture and belongings. The man starts walking off with a phonograph that belonged to Eun Hwan's dead father. Sang Doo, sees her misery, runs after the man and tries to steal it back. However, through that process the man is pushed into a lake and drowns.


Eun Hwan does not know this, and leaves with her mother. Sang Doo returns from jail to find Eun Hwan gone and his house empty; his parents abandoned him to move to the states. He drops out of high school to live with his uncle.


Having an ailing daughter, Sang Doo makes money to settle the medical bills by working as a boytoy and going out with rich women, most of whom are many years older than him.


One day, when he runs into Eun Hwan again, he knows deep down that she is the one he has been waiting for all his life. To approach Eun Hwan, Sang Doo begins to work as a security guard at the school she works in. Then he became a student after being fired from his security job.
He wanted to work at the school because he wanted to see Eun Hwan (whom was a teacher at that school).

Westminster School is an 





independent




, 
Uniting Church school located at 

Marion
, 
South Australia, 12km south of 
Adelaide.


Founded as a Methodist Day and Boarding School for boys, the School was opened by the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, in 1961 and is named after 

Westminster School
 in London. 


The foundation Headmaster, Douglas Forder, presided over an initial enrolment of 143 students with a staff of seven. The School became coeducational in 1978, and has a current enrolment of just over eleven hundred students.


Subsequent Principals have been Michael Murray (1977 - 1993), David Hone (1994 - 1998) and Bradley Fenner (1999 - present).


Deputy Headmasters of the school have included 







Thomas Edmonds






, who was one of the founding members of staff in 1961, and who became Deputy Headmaster of the school in 1965 



 History 


Westminster School was born out of a perceived need by the 


Methodist

 Church in 
South Australia for a day and boarding school in 

Adelaide
 to accommodate demand additional to that satisfied by the long-established Methodist-based school 






Prince Alfred College





.  


Planning for Westminster began with a meeting on the 7th June 1957, although at that stage it was not known where the school would be built, or when. With growing momentum, it was resolved in December of that year to purchase twenty five acres of vineyards from the South Australian Housing Trust at 

Marion
. At the inaugural fundraising dinner on 9th June 1959, 160 men volunteered to solicit 3000 prospective contributors to achieve a target of $200,000 for the first building phase. The amount ultimately raised by those who have been affectionately called 'the Men of Westminster' was $320,000.2


The school commenced on 7th February 1961, with its initial enrolment boosted by a number of former 






Prince Alfred College





 students. At the School's first assembly, broadcast on radio station 5KA, the Headmaster's opening address began with the words, Let the life of the School begin . 


The initial buildings comprised a single classroom block (known today as the '200 block'), the Headmaster's residence and a changeroom block. Throughout the 1960 s the campus expanded from its modest beginnings with the addition of the Boarding House (1962), Preparatory School (1963), Administration Block (known as the  100  block) (1965), Carter Laboratories (1965), Chapel (1967), Gymnasium / Hall (1967) and in the early 1970s the Fricker Library was built. 


Boarders were originally housed at Shaftsbury House in Adelaide, before on-campus dormitory style accommodation (known as 'Heaslip House') was opened in 1962.The boarding facility also included a dining room and common room. In 1964 a further dormitory wing was added, which became known as 'Woollacott House'. In the 1980s following the introduction of female boarders, the School acquired existing home units in Adeline Court, adjoining the school property, and progressively purchased additional units and land as boarding numbers grew.  


The move to become coeducational in 1978 arguably provided a catalyst in transforming Westminster from an institution that had been formed in the shadow of 






Prince Alfred College





 to a significant entity in its own right.


The school attracted minor controversy in July 2007 when fifteen students and five adults had to be rescued in severe weather off  Victor Harbor.3




 Campus 


The Sir Shirley Jeffries Memorial Chapel was opened in 1967. Located in the central entranceway between the Preparatory and Senior Schools, the Chapel commemorates a former South Australian  Minister of Education, 
Sir Shirley Jeffries, who was one of the early benefactors and supporters of the School. 


The Michael Murray Centre for the Performing Arts is a multi-purpose theatre opened in 1988 by the Headmaster of Westminster School, London, Mr. D.M. Summerscale. The School's second Headmaster, Michael Murray, was a keen supporter of the arts during his tenure at Westminster.


The Cloisters, between the 100 and 200 blocks, opened in 1991, and involved the creation of wide arched verandahs, a brick staircase, fountain and lawn area reminiscent of English public school design.


The Sports and Swimming Centre was opened in 2003 by the Chairman of 

Round Square
, His Majesty 

King Constantine II of Greece
. Occupying the site of the former gymnasium, the Centre comprises a ten lane half size Olympic Pool, training pool, two full size basketball courts, rock climbing wall and a weights area. The dance studio and multi-purpose meeting room, The David Jarman Room, opened on 18th May 2007, is an upper floor area within the Centre with a large balcony overlooking the main oval. This multi purpose room is named after former long-serving staff member and Registrar, David Jarman.




 Houses 



Houses were introduced in 1962. The inaugural houses were Heaslip, Jeffries, Woollacott and School (the Boarding House). 


The present Houses in the Senior School, named primarily after early benefactors of the School, are Carter (sky blue), Clark (green), Dunstan (maroon), Fereday (dark blue), Forder (brown), Fricker (orange), Heaslip (red), Jeffries (yellow), Kelly (lilac) and Woollacott (white).
In the Preparatory School, the Houses follow a more English theme and are named Abbey, Charter, Crown, Mace, Wesley and Wyvern.




Glenroy Westminster



The school owns a 68 hectare property at Point Sturt on the lower River Murray. The property is being revegetated and is used as a base for 'Westventure', the school's 12 day outdoor education programme for year 10 students. Glenroy commemorates the name of the property owned by the school's first Chairman of Council, Frank Heaslip.

Companies based in Arizona




Soultone (full name: Soultone Amplification, Inc.), is an American 
guitar amplifier manufacturing company, based in 

Chandler, Arizona
, and known for making hand wired 
instrument amplifiers using vintage and modern techniques, components, and features. 

Soultone is exemplary of 
boutique musical instrument manufacturers.



 Company History 


The founder of Soultone was an 
amateur musician and 
DIY amplification enthusiast Michael Corrieri. Frustrated with modern guitar amplification offerings, he began producing modern variants of vintage amplifiers. Early success, owing to the short-supply and high-demand of top-quality products, led to a full blown business model and corporate identity.




 Design Philosophy 


While original examples of classic vintage amplifiers can be purchased for large sums of money, they are also reputed to exhibit unreliable performance. 
Vacuum tube amplifiers are susceptible to (and sources of) 
noise, and usually produce 
sound pressure levels only suitable for larger performance venues. Nonetheless, many purists believe that 
Digital Signal Processing will never be able to produce the 
dynamics (music), warmth, and complex 
harmonic distortion of 
vacuum tubes. Soultone advocated improved manufacturing techniques and materials, as well as carefully selected 
new old stock (NOS) and modern manufactured components, would produce modern variants of vintage classic amplifiers  with greater reliability and significantly less noise.


With their modern power controls, Soultone amplifiers can reproduce stadium sized tube distortion sounds all the way down to recording studio, or even bedroom levels. Power Scaling is a power controlling technology, licensed from 
London Power / Power Press, that lowers the power tube voltages, including proportionately scaled bias voltages, in order to reduce the audible volume; the power amplifier itself is changed from larger to smaller with the turn of a knob.


By carefully crafting each instrument by hand, boutique builders like Soultone are able to retain a vintage character and flavor not found in mass produced products, even when using high-tech innovations.




 Manufacturing Technique 



Soultone is most notable for its sophisticated  modern vintage  
manufacturing process.


New products are first blue printed using electronics fabrication test fixtures, that allow the easy replacement of components and component values. When a circuit design is arrived at, all components are fed into a modern 
3D CAD/CAM system, in order to arrive at an optimum layout. Issues with component placement are removed early in the design process.  Once a design layout is perfected, mechanical drawings are printed and code generated for sheet-metal production.


The actual circuitry is then built upon hybrid 
PCB/Turret boards, using the hand wiring techniques typical of smaller 
boutique instrument amplifier makers. A hybrid PCB/Turret board is produced with the supply circuit traces, and the remainder of the board is perforated for placement of turrets. The tone circuit is then laid out by a careful placement of the turrets, and then hand wrapping components onto the turrets. 
MILSPEC 
teflon-coated, silver-plated, aircraft control wire is then 
tinned, and wrapped upon each turret, making the final connections to power, ground, tube sockets, and controls.


These amplifiers are esteemed for the artistry of their wiring, their top-down engineering, high quality enclosures fabrication, hand wound transformers, NASA grade precision soldering, modern power features, and excellent sound.




 Virtual business model 


The internet and online forums have greatly aided boutique style manufacturers, by spreading word of mouth marketing directly to potential buyers, relying upon news group 
word-of-mouth, as wells as capitalizing upon the publicity generated by 
consumer advocates sourcing 
flame wars over old versus new methods of manufacturing. The new manufacturing model is favored by a virtual presence, out-of-state tax free internet catalog sales, online payment methods, and easy world-wide shipping, all available via the Internet. Savvy manufacturers can generate all necessary code for sophisticated metal manufacturers as far ways as China, greatly reducing their operating costs.




 Mainstream Competition 


With the success of this booming 
cottage industry in high dollar musical instrument amplification, the big four manufacturers jumped head long into the boutique manufacturing market. 






Marshall





, 

Fender
, 

Gibson
, and 
Vox all currently offer entirely hand wired re-creations of their vintage products, often at costs lower than boutique competition. These products hold an even greater appeal to consumers, as they join the coveted hand-wired hype with household names and corporate longevity. While builders like Soultone have managed to survive this onslaught by combining modern and vintage processes, techniques, and materials, much of this cottage industry is quickly vanishing. Only time will tell if any of these new companies will remain viable, as the big four manufacturers become more responsive to potential buyer's actual desires, thanks largely to the internet. These larger companies have deeper products to dedicate to extensive market research, which could revitalize the musical instrument market with newer products that utilize the  modern vintage  approach. Boutique builders may in the end be relying upon their early reputation and momentum to sustain business growth.




 Product Line 


The Soultone line currently includes 
valve amplifiers from 18 to 45 
watts, in head/cabinet as well as combo formats.

The Moonshiner is a folk song with disputed origins. It is believed that the song originated in America, then later made famous in Ireland. Others believe that it was the other way around. 







The Clancy Brothers






 stated on their recording that the song is of Irish origin, but again, this is disputed. 


Bob Dylan

 performed  Moonshiner  around 1963 on his Bootleg series, 1-3. The song has also been performed by

Lyrics:
I've been a moonshiner for many a year,
I've spent all me money on wisky and beer,
I'll go to some hollow and I'll set up me still
and I'll make you a gallon for a ten shilling bill.


Re: I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home,
and if you don't like me, well, leave me alone.
I'll eat when I'm hungry and I'll drink when I'm dry,
and if moonshine don't kill me, I'll live till I die.


I'll go to some hallow in this counterie,
ten gallons a wash I can go on a spree,
No women to follow, the world is all mine, 
and I love none so well as I love the moonshine.


Re.


O moonshine, dear moonshine, oh how I love thee,
you've kill me old father, but ah you try me,
now bless all moonshiners  and bless all moonshine,
there breathe smells as sweet as the dew on the vine.

The Birds of America is the title of a book by 
naturalist and 
painter 


John James Audubon

, containing paintings and scientific description of a wide variety of 
birds of the 








United States







. It was first published as a series of sections between 1827 and 1838.


The work consists of hand-colored, life-size 
prints made from 
engraved plates measuring around 39 by 26 
inches. The original edition was engraved in 
aquatint by Robert 
Havell Sr. and son, 
Robert Havell Jr.; known as the  Double Elephant folio , it is often regarded as the greatest picture book ever produced. A copy in excellent condition sold at 
Christie's in March of 2000 for $8,802,500, is still (
as of 2007) a world record for any printed book.


All 435 of John James Audubon's known extant watercolors preparatory for Birds of America are housed at the

Koilonychia is a 
nail disease that can be a sign of iron-deficiency 
anemia.1 Koilonychia literally means  spoon nails.    It refers to nails (usually of the hand) which have lost their convexity, becoming flat or even concave in shape.  In a sense, koilonychia is the opposite of

The O'Brien Theatre



The O'Brien Theatre is an historic 
cinema in the town of 

Arnprior, Ontario
. Arnprior's first cinema opened on the site in 1906, and the current building dates from 1919. It was originally both a cinema and venue for vaudeville performances. With the growth in popularity of films the building renovated and became a full time cinema in 1929. It was owned by the O'Brien Entertainment Corporation, which owned a number of cinemas in the 
Ottawa Valley. Several other towns in the area had O'Brien cinemas. The equally historic 
O'Brien Theatre in 

Renfrew, Ontario
 is the only other still open, and both theatres are today again owned by the same company. Not part of any of the major theatre chains, the O'Brien has been owned by several small businesses over the last decades. In 2000 the theatre was completely refurbished and restored to its 1930s appearance.

State of Mexico

Seat





Ciudad Lopez Mateos is a city in the 
State of Mexico, 
Mexico and the seat of the municipality called Atizapan de Zaragoza. The municipality takes its name from the 
nahuatl word  t zapan, which is formed by three words:   , which means  water ,  t za-tl , which means  white clay  and   pan , which means  over  or  place over  in a metaphorical form. Finished this, the name means  Place over clay waters . Atizapan is located east from 

Toluca
, and inside the 



Greater Mexico City


 limits.



The city


The city was previously named Atizapan de Zaragoza, but the official name was changed after president 
Adolfo Lopez Mateos who was born in that town. However, the city is still known as Atizapan. There were 471,904 inhabitants counted with the 
2005 census. It is the seventh-largest city in the state. The city is the municipal seat of the 
municipality of Atizapan de Zaragoza, and for all practical purposes is coextensive with it. 


During the French Intervention, General 











Ignacio Zaragoza










 stayed here, and used the town for the gathering of weapons.


This was the hometown of Mexican President 
Adolfo Lopez Mateos, and a mausoleum was built in his memory in downtown Atizapan.




The municipality


While the city takes up almost all of the municipality, Ciudad Lopez Mateos has governing jurisdiction over: Campos los Cedros, El Pedregal, Presa las Ruinas, Presa San Juan, Valle de Paz, Viejo Madin and Rancho Blanco Ejido de Espiritu Santo, the only one with any significant population at 501 people.


The municipality has an area of 89.9 km  (34.71 sq mi) and reported a population of 472,526. It lies in the northeastern part of the state, just northwest of the 


Federal District (Mexico City)

. This municipality is in the northwestern part of the state (in the metropolitan area of Mexico City). The municipality borders 








Naucalpan







, 

Tlalnepantla de Baz
, and 
Cuautitlan Izcalli. 


In 
1984, the city hall was transferred from downtown Atizapan, to a new building near the municipal limit with the municipality of Tlalnepantla de Baz


Since 
1997, Atizapan has been under the government of the 

National Action Party




 The Antonio Dominguez Scandal 


In 
2000, 
Antonio Dominguez Zambrano was elected as the President of Atizapan, representing the National Action Party. After taking possession of the government was discovered that he was the head of many corruption and fraud events and also bullying rivals and fraud.


But the main charge was the murder of fellow party partner Maria de los Angeles Tamez Reyes, which at the time was working as part of his government.


As a result, Antonio Dominguez was found guilty on all accounts and sent to prison with his secretary Daniel Garcia.





 Geography 



Three 
rivers have their waterway across Atizapan: Tlalnepatla River, San Javier River and Moritas River, all of them located north of the municipality.


Inside Atizapan, near the border with Naucalpan, is located the Madin Dam, which provides water to the north west part of the Greater Mexico City area.


Also, various 
streams have their waterway across Atizapan such as  La Bolsa , La Herradura,  El Tecojote  and  El Xhinte .


Its main elevations are Biznaga

Although none of the main transportation ways in greater Mexico City have stations in Atizapan, many bus lines cross Atizapan, and go mainly to the north, center and south west parts of Mexico City.


In the beginning of the 
20th Century, a train line called  Montealto  had its end in Atizapan.


In the north part of Atizapan is located an Airport, which has minimal use, as no 
airlines are established.


Also, one highway passes across Atizapan, and serves to communicate Atizapan with the Capital City of the 
State of Mexico Toluca, the Interlomas, Santa Fe and Herradura 
Boroughs, and with the Mexico-Queretaro highway.

Medical_tests




The KOH test is a procedure in which 
potassium hydroxide (KOH) is used to detect 
fungi by dissolving human cells in a culture.  The difference in cell wall composition of human cells and fungal cells allows this procedure to help distinguish the two cells.  KOH denatures the proteins in the human cell; only the fungal cells remain to be seen under the microscope.

KOH test procedure:





 Take scraping from margin (not center) of lesion


  Place on clean slide


  Add 2-3 drops of 10% KOH in water


  Warm the slide (don't boil)


  Optional - add 1 drop of lactophenol cotton blue


  Add cover slip


  Examine immediately under high dry magnification with light microscope




It is used to detect whether a patient has Athlete's foot and many other fungal infections.

1889) was an 








American







 lawyer and politician from 

Abingdon, Virginia
. He served in the

Virginia
 in the 

United States Senate
 when the state was readmitted after the 

Civil War
. Johnston was initially ineligible to serve in Congress due to the 









Fourteenth Amendment








, which removed the ability of anyone to hold public office who had sworn allegiance to the United States and subsequently sided with the 
Confederacy during the Civil War. However his restrictions were removed at the suggestion of the 
Freedman's Bureau. Thus, he was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy  to serve in the U.S. Senate.

Bernard






First appearance



The Rescuers
 (1977)



Created by







Margery Sharp








Voiced by



Bob Newhart




Bernard, the 
mouse, is a fictional character in 





Margery Sharp




's Miss Bianca stories, and a protagonist in 
Disney's 
1977 animated film, 

The Rescuers
 and its 
1990 
sequel, 


The Rescuers Down Under

.


Bernard and Miss Bianca



The timid mouse Bernard works as a janitor at the Rescue Aid Society, a mouse organization for rescue in an underground floor inside the 
United Nations.  Bernard is secretly in love with Hungary's representative, the lovely Miss Bianca, but he is too shy to let her know his feelings and is ignorant to the fact that Miss Bianca feels a friendly affection towards him as well.  When the Rescue Aid Society finds a human bottle containing a plea for help, the delicate 


Miss Bianca

 is heartbroken after hearing the message which is from a little girl.  


Miss Bianca

 begs Mr. Chairman that he'll allow her to take part in this dangerous mission and Bernard is surprised when she asks him to be her partner in this journey.


The two mice then follow their only clue and come to Morningside Orphanage, where they meet Rufus.  Rufus, an old cat tells his story of the poor little orphan girl who wanted nothing more than a loving family and who now seems to have run away.  Unconvinced, Bernard choses to believe that Penny did not run off, instead, he believes she might have been kidnapped.  Rufus gives them their newest clue, 


Madame Medusa

.  After further investigation, the courageous duo discover that the girl has indeed been kidnapped, by 


Madame Medusa

 and her three henchmen, 


Mr. Snoops

 and her two crocodiles, 


Brutus and Nero

.  Madame needs a small girl to squeeze into an underground pirate cave and search for the Devil's Eye, the world's largest diamond.




Personality



In the film, Bernard is a symbol of bravery.  Although 


Miss Bianca

 is often credited with being the  brain  of the duo, Bernard is no less intelligent. Still, when the situation becomes critical, Bernard will take courage from wherever inside him and will not fail to do his part with considerable heroism.  An important aspect of Bernard's personality is that of a highly 
superstitious being.  Terribly afraid of the number 
13 (As well as flying), Bernard often encounters obstacles in his responsibilities.




Miscellanea






 Bernard was voiced by 

Bob Newhart
 and his animation was directed by 


Frank Thomas

 and 

Ollie Johnston
.


 

Bob Newhart
, who voiced Bernard, was afraid of flying himself.  One of Newhart's comedy routines was called  The Mrs. Grace L. Ferguson Airline (And Storm Door Company) , wherein he explains why he hates to fly.  The Disney crew then used this information when it came time to develop the personality of their animated character.






Origin



Disney's Bernard was inspired by Bernard in 





Margery Sharp




's The Rescuers series and much of his personality and character were kept.  However, in Disney's 

The Rescuers
, Bernard's role is more significant, as opposed to in the novel, Miss Bianca in which Bernard has a very minor role and the rescue was left almost entirely to 


Miss Bianca

 herself.

Hekman's boo in Schoonebeek.



A boo (also spelled boo or boe)  ( 


info


) is an old 
Saxon building where a farmer could spend the night with his 
cattle if he let them graze far outside the village. The building, which had separate areas for cattle and farmer to live, would have been made with cheap materials. Walls were made of 
straw or braided twigs covered in cow 
manure or 
loam; the roof was also made of straw.


Etymology


The word boo is a cognate of the German word 'Bude' which means 'shack'.1 The 
circumflex on the second 'o' indicates that a letter is left out. In Danish, 'bo' means 
house. The word boo is 

Low German
.




History


A (usually unmarried) 
cattle 
farmer who spent time in a boo was called a boo-heer and was employed by a so-called  broodheer  (literally: bread lord). Once every fourteen days, the boo-heer would return to the farm for food supplies and clean clothes. He could keep the earnings of his only 
milk cow and the eggs his chickens laid.


The villages of 








Schoonebeek







 and 








Nieuw-Schoonebeek







 in the border area with 

Germany
 in the Dutch province of 

Drenthe
 are the only places where these buildings can be found. Because of this, Nieuw-Schoonebeek was known as Booendorf on the German side of the border. The boos that can be found there today are 
replicas, which were not built in the original boos' locations.


The last genuine boo, the Wilmsboo (owned by the Drents Historical Society De Spiker) in Nieuw Schoonebeek (
1640) burnt down in October 2004.2 The historical society suspected 
arson as the building had no gas or electricity.3 In March 2005, a restoration programme was begun. Before it burned down, plans were afoot to have the original building listed on the 
European list of monuments.


Another replica, the Hekmansboo, is on the terrain of the 
dairy farm  De Katshaar  (not its original location) along the Europaweg (N863) in Schoonebeek.

Red Stone (or Red Gem) is a 2D 
MMORPG developed by L K Logic Korea. There are currently three companies that hold licenses to the game, including GameOn and K2 Network. You have the choice between eight classes; these however are all divided into two subclasses each (for example a character can both the squire and warrior skill sets. Sometimes characters go through a sort of  metamorphosis  to transform from one subclass to another (e.g. magician to werewolf). http://playredstone.gamersfirst.com/classes.php ) 
There is also a very large array of weapons built on the principle of prefixes and suffixes (as in 
diablo. There is also a system of graded rarity, again derived from diablo. Parties of up to eight different people may be formed, and are often required to complete secret dungeons (SDs) where the best experience may be found. A guild system is available, and guild wars is the only form of pvp in the game.

 Danish fairy tales




Niels and the Giants is a Danish 
fairy tale.  















Andrew Lang














 included by 
The Crimson Fairy Book.


Synopsis


A couple had two sons.  The older was content to be a shepherd like his father, but the 


younger

, Niels, wanted to be a hunter.  He got a gun, practiced with it, and became a good shot.  The mother decided she wanted to go on a 
pilgrimage to Rome.  The family sold everything they own and set out; Niels brought the gun.  One night, they did not stay at an inn because the heat had made them go slowly that day, and the moon was up.  They came to a crossroads in the forest and did not know which way to go.  They decided to stay there.  In the first watch, the older son shot a stage; in the second, the younger climbed a tree and saw three 
giants.  They were eating, and by careful shots, he had them quarrel about knocking each others' hands and making them prick themselves with the forks.  The third giant realized he was about and caught him.  


They demanded a service of him.  They wished to carry off the king's daughter, and had put everyone to sleep in the castle except a little black dog.  If he shot the dog so it did not bark and wake everyone, they would spare his life.   They threw him in and he landed on grass.  He shot the dog and went to the gate, but on the way, he saw an enormous sword, a drinking horn, and an inscription saying that whoever drank from the horn could wield the sword.  He looked through the castle and found the princess.  He took half her handkerchief and one of her slippers.  Then he drained the horn and could wield the sword.  He went to the gate, where there was a small door and a large door.  He opened the small door, claimed he was too weak for the large one, and cut off their heads as they came through.  Then he ran to rejoin his family, with his sword.  He shut the door with such a bang that the castle woke.  They were astounded by the bodies.  The princess said they must find the giant-slayer, because she was honor-bound to marry him.  She had a house built, and put over its door that whoever told the story of his life could stay there for nothing.


Meanwhile, Niels and his family went on toward Rome, but they met a man who showed them the holes in his shoes, and told them the shoes had been new when he left Rome.  Discouraged, they turned back.  They came upon the house and decided to stay there.  The steward questioned the father and the older son, and told the princess that nothing had happened to them, but admitted he had not asked them all.  The princess went herself.  The older brother put in that he had forgotten to tell that his brother had found a sword.  Niels, who had guessed this was a way to discover him, wanted to escape, but they found the sword, and searched him, finding the handkerchief and slipper. Niels was afraid that they would punish him, but the princess said only they must wait until her father returned.  When he did, the princess married Niels, who was king after the king died.

Peter Zoller (born 
16 September 
1952) is a theoretical physicist from 

Austria
. He is 
Professor at the 

University of Innsbruck
 and works on 
quantum optics and 
quantum information and is best known for his pioneering research on 
quantum computing and 
quantum communication and for bridging quantum optics and 
solid state physics.



Biography


Peter Zoller studied physics at the 

University of Innsbruck
, obtained his doctorate there in February 1977, and became a lecturer at their Institute of Theoretical Physics. For 1978/79, he was granted a 






Max Kade





 stipend to research with 
Peter Lambropoulos at the 


University of Southern California

. In 1980, he stayed in 

Auckland
, 









New Zealand








, as a researcher with the group around 
Dan Walls. In 1981, Peter Zoller handed in his book  Uber die lichtstatistische Abhangigkeit resonanter Multiphoton-Prozesse  at the University of Innsbruck to qualify as a professor by receiving the  venia docendi . He spent 1981/82 and 1988 as Visiting Fellow at the 
Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) of the 

University of Colorado
, 
Boulder, and 1986 as guest professor at the 




Universite de Paris-Sud 11



, 





Orsay




. In 1991, Peter Zoller was appointed Professor of Physics and JILA Fellow at JILA and at the Physics Department of the University of Colorado, Boulder. At the end of 1994, he accepted a chair at the University of Innsbruck, where he has worked ever since. From 1995 to 1999, he headed the Institute of Theoretical Physics, from 2001 to 2004, he was vice-dean of studies. Peter Zoller continues to keep in close touch with JILA as Adjoint Fellow.

Austrian Academy of Sciences



.




Research


As a theoretician, Peter Zoller has written major works on the interaction of 
laser light and 
atoms. In addition to fundamental developments in quantum optics he has succeeded in bridging quantum information and solid state physics. The model of a quantum computer1, suggested by him and 
Ignacio Cirac in 1995, is based on the interaction of lasers with cold 
ions confined in an electromagnetic trap. The principles of this idea have been implemented in experiments over recent years and it is considered one of the most promising concepts for the development of a scalable 
quantum computer. Zoller and his researcher colleagues have also managed to link quantum physics with solid state physics. One of his suggestions has been to build a 
quantum simulator with cold 
atoms and use it to research hitherto unexplained phenomena in high temperature 
superconductors2. Zoller s ideas and concepts attract plenty of interest within the scientific community, his works have been cited more than 18,000 times to date (2008).




Awards


Peter Zoller has received numerous awards for his achievements in the field of quantum optics and quantum information and especially for his pioneering work on quantum computers and quantum communication. These include the 
Dirac Medal (2006), the 6th 
International Quantum Communication Award (2006), the 
Niels Bohr/UNESCO Gold Medal (2005), the 



Max Planck Medal


 (2005) of the 

Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft
, the Humboldt Research Award (2000), the 
Schrodinger Prize (1998) of the 




Austrian Academy of Sciences



, the 
Max Born Award (1998) of the 




Optical Society of America



, as well as the 
Wittgenstein Award (1998), Austria s highest scientific accolade. In 2001, Peter Zoller became full member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in 2008 he was elected to the 






United States National Academy of Sciences





 and the 
Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Indian magazines




The Calcutta Review is a bi-annual periodical, now published by the 
Calcutta University press, featuring scholarly articles from a variety of disciplines.


History


The Calcutta Review was founded in May 1844, by Sir 






John William Kaye





. Through the journal, Sir Kaye aimed  to bring together such useful information, and propagate such sound opinions, relating to Indian affaire, as will, it is hoped, conduce, in some small measure, directly or indirectly, to the amelioration of the condition of the people .


The periodical proved to be successful, and was published as a quarterly up until 1912. Sir Kaye was Editor of four issues, and then retired due to ill health. He remained the owner of the review until 1855, when it was purchased by Meredith Townsend. Thacker, Spink and Company bought it in 1857. It was printed by Sanders and Cowes until 1857, when it moved to the Serampore Press. When Rev. T. Ridsdale took over as editor, it was published by R. C Lepage and Company.


The journal was not published in 1912. In its second series, from 1913 to 1920, it was published bi-annually. In 1921, it was acquired by the Calcutta University press, who now releases it bi-annually.

The Aga Khan Mzizima Secondary School, 

Dar es Salaam
 is a co-educational non-government school in 

Dar es Salaam
, 

Tanzania
. It was founded in 
1967, and is operated by the 



Aga Khan Education Services


, an agency of the 






Aga Khan Development Network





. The school's motto is  Better Always Better . 
Established in 1967 as a co-educational institution, the Aga Khan Mzizima Secondary School is one of Tanzania's leading non-government schools. The Aga Khan Mzizima Secondary School motto is  Better Always Better .


The School strives to create a harmonious balance between academic demands, sporting and cultural activities and community life. It challenges its pupils to be intellectually inquisitive and socially conscious. The School believes that while what students know is important, the true measure of a student s education is to explore the limitations of their knowledge.


For three consecutive years (2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003), Mzizima was awarded the Certificate of Excellence (Ist Grade) from the Minister of Education and Culture and Inspectorate for exemplary performance at the Tanzanian National Examinations.
It adopted the International Baccalaureate system before the 2005/2006 academic year began.





  The School's History 




Established in 1967, as a co-educational institution, the Aga Khan Mzizima Secondary School is one of Tanzania's leading non-government schools. The Aga Khan Mzizima Secondary School motto is  Better Always Better .


The School is part of the Aga Khan Education Services (AKES). AKES has a long tradition of leadership in educational development. The foundations of the present system were laid by Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah, Aga Khan III, under whose guidance over 200 schools were established during the first half of the 20th century, the earliest of them in 1905 in Zanzibar, Gwadur in Pakistan and Mundra in India. Since the creation of Aga Khan Education Service companies in the 1970s, the schools have been centrally administered and managed.


AKES currently operates more than 300 schools and advanced educational programmes that provide quality pre-school, primary, secondary and higher secondary education services to more than 54,000 students in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Uganda, Tanzania and Tajikistan. Schools are also envisaged, or under development, in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique and Syria.


In the last 36 years, the School has undergone three major changes. The first came in 1980, when Mzizima introduced a six-week orientation course for Form I students. This initiative assisted students who could not cope with the change from the Kiswahili primary level instruction to English-based instruction in secondary school.


Students were taught sufficient language skills to help them better grasp English-medium classes during the orientation course. Other subjects were also taught in English at a level accessible to students.


After 1980, Mzizima introduced student-centred education (then a novel idea in Tanzania). Before this change, teaching at the School was passive, with the teacher lecturing the class and providing notes. In today s curriculum, class discussions and projects are of equal importance to tests and exams.


As a result of these changes and a rise in academic rigour, the School began to receive more prospective students than it could accommodate. In 1990, a merit-based entry system was introduced. Prospective Form I students were admitted based on their performance at an entrance test.


Over time, the School s existing A-level streams - PCM (Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics) and PCB (Physics, Chemistry and Biology) no longer fully catered to the academic interests and needs of all students. This prompted the School to introduce the ECA (Economics, Commerce and Accountancy) stream in 1995. Today, the School offers the PCM, PCB and ECA combinations at Advanced Level.
In line with the commitment to provide educational leadership in Tanzania , in 2005, the centenary of Aga Khan schooling worldwide, parents were offered an alternative to the national curriculum for their children. This new program has introduced the British-based IGCSE and an application to the International Baccalaureate Organization for accreditation to the Diploma Program to allow students to graduate with an internationally recognized qualification. The culmination of this initiative will be the opening of a purpose built facility near the University of Dar es Salaam. The foundation stone for this state-of-the-art school was laid by His Excellency the President of Tanzania Benjamin William Mkapa in the presence of His Highness the Aga Khan.

 School population 



The School has a population of 725 students. There are 365 students studying for  O levels (Forms I - IV) and 160 for the  A  Levels (Forms V - VI). 200 students are studying in the new curriculum section leading on to the IGCSE exams at Grade 11. 45% of the student population is female.


English is the medium of instruction and the School offers the Tanzanian National Curriculum at both the  O  and  A  Levels. And also the IB Diploma for students who have completed their middle school years.  The Head of School has a team 5 Mentor teachers, 50 teachers, 13 administrative and 15 support staff to effectively facilitate the teaching - learning process.




 Parent Teacher Meetings 



Open Days serve as an occasion for parents and teachers to interact and complete the triangle of the three important stakeholders in any school; teachers, parents and students.


Every term, the School organises an Open Day for each level. Subject teachers spend two to three hours with parents discussing their child s academic progress, attendance, discipline and school participation. The Head of School also addresses queries from parents, seeks feedback, solicits parental involvement in various activities and updates them of various curricular and co-curricular developments and achievements.


The School also organises an orientation programme for new Grade 8 students. It serves as an induction for parents and students to the school ethos, tradition, culture, facilities and its staff. We encourage parents to be involved in the social and emotional development of their child. Our focus lies in developing parents as critical partners, actively contributing to the effective functioning of the School.





 Curriculum 


The School follows the Tanzanian National Curriculum, both for O and A levels. The School curriculum is continuously being enriched to ensure students receive a balanced educational experience. The following subjects are offered at O levels:


English 
French 
Kiswahili 
History 
Geography 
Civics 
Mathematics 
Physics 
Chemistry 
Biology 
Commerce 
Book Keeping 
Computers
At A -Levels the following subject combinations are offered:


Economics, Commerce, Accountancy (ECA) 
Physics, Chemistry, Biology (PCB) 
Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics (PCM)
In January 2005, the school introduced a new curriculum that leads to the IGCSE examinations at Grade 11. The International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) Examinations are administered by CIE, University of Cambridge International Examinations, which is part of the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES).


IGCSE provides a foundation for higher-level courses such as: GCE A-Levels, the Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE) Diploma, North American Advanced Placement Test and the IB International Baccalaureate Diploma.


The IGCSE curriculum programme at Mzizima is taken over a period of two academic years in Grade 10 and Grade 11. The exam is taken in May/June.


Students at Aga Khan Mzizima Secondary School make their subject choices for the IGCSE from the following list:




Group I Languages English
French
Kiswahili - GCE O Level 


Group II Humanities and Social Sciences Economics
Geography
History 


Group III Sciences Biology
Chemistry
Physics 


Group IV Mathematics Mathematics
Additional Mathematics 


Group V Business, Creative,
Technical and Vocational Business Studies
Art and Design
Accounting
Computer Studies 


Students choose a total of eight subjects with at least one subject from each group. All subjects are to be taken at the extended level. The achievement grades available at extended level are A. B. C. D., A. B. C. being O-level equivalent grades.


An ICE (International Certificate of Education) is awarded to candidates who pass in seven subjects including 2 from Group I and one from each group II to V. The seventh subject may be from any of the syllabus groups.


Aga Khan Mzizima Secondary School has been inspected by a British Council Exam Manager on behalf of CIE of Cambridge University. Subsequent to that examination, the School was recommended as an IGSCE centre and as a school able to offer the IGCSE curriculum programme. The facilities at Mzizima Secondary School , including science laboratories, a well-stocked library, a Computer Centre, text books, classrooms and a team of committed trained teachers with many years of professional experience, are well-suited to the IGSCE,

Gaioz Devdariani



Gaioz Devdariani (

Georgian
:                 ) ( 
October 2, 
1901 1938) was a 

Georgian
 
revolutionary, 
intellectual, 



Soviet


 politician and a victim of the 
Great Purge. Devdariani was born in the village of 
Kharagauli, Western 

Georgia
 into a large middle class family. In 1919, Devdariani was arrested by the 

Menshevik Government of Georgia
 for alleged plotting and masterminding an insurrection against the government. He was imprisoned in 
Metekhi and managed to escape from the prison in 1920. During the same year, under the instructions of the 

Bolshevik
 party, Devdariani was sent to 


South Ossetia

 to quell the rebellion.  Between 1921 and 1923, Devdariani worked in various communist ministries in 
Georgian SSR. Devdariani was one of the most highly educated intellectuals in the Georgian Bolshevik circles. Due to his academic and educational background he became the first 
Minister of Education of Georgian SSR in 1931. After only a year as a Minister, he was promoted to the First Secretary of the 
Communist Party of the 
Georgian SSR. 1 However, soon after his appointment, 

Lavrentiy Beria
 (Communist Party Secretary of 
Transcaucasia) started agitations and provocations against Gaioz. 

Brothers of Devdariani, 
George Devdariani (commanding officer of Soviet Division in 
Transcaucasus) and 
Shalva Devdariani held important positions in Georgian SSR and the communist party. They became the first targets of Beria and 





Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze




. In 1933, George Devdariani was shot by one of the deserters from his division. It has been alleged that Beria plotted the 
desertion and instructed the soldier to kill his commanding officer. In 1934 Shalva Devdariani was arrested in 

Tbilisi
 and was said to have been personally executed by Beria. After learning of his brother s arrest and execution, Devdariani resigned from his position and moved to 

Zaporizhia
, 

Ukraine
.  There he became the head of military aviation factory. Under the pressure from Beria, 
Stalin gave an order to arrest Devdariani and indict him with charges of plotting to assassinate Lavrentiy Beria and of having links with exiled 


Leon Trotsky

. Devdariani was declared an  enemy of the people  and was denounced for 
Trotskyism. While the charges against Devdariani were entirely false, Beria, a master provocateur, persuaded Stalin to grant him an approval for Devdariani's liquidation.


Before the arrest and murder of his brothers, based on his personal letters and diaries, Devdariani lost any belief in communism and confessed to his family members of being intolerant to the totalitarian regime of Stalin, Beria and the Bolsheviks. Before his final days in Tbilisi prison cell, he hoped for the chance to emigrate to 
Laville 

France
 where he would join the Menshevik government of 












Noe Zhordania











 in exile. However, he was condemned to death by 
NKVD troika and executed in 1938. His son, 
Spartak Devdariani  was sent to the 

Eastern Front
 in  
Penal military unit (being charged under 




Article 58 of counter-revolutionary activities



)  where he was killed during the 

Prague Offensive
. His second son 









David Devdariani








 was imprisoned for being the 
 the son of the enemy of the people  (

Russian language
:                   ). He later became a political 
dissident and activist for independent Georgia. He was finally released by the order of 


Nikita Khrushchev

. 


Devdariani published numerous books and articles about Communism and Georgia, of which the most popular one was The History of Communism in Georgia.

The Pacific Northwest Inlander is a free weekly newspaper published in 

Spokane, Washington
 and circulated throughout the

This is a list of tributes and references to the 








American







 
composer,

singer, 
film director, and 
satirist, 




Frank Zappa



.


Appearances in media





 Zappa made an appearance on 

The Steve Allen Show
 in 1963. This appearance featured Frank demonstrating the wide scope of percussion by playing the spokes of a spinning bicycle wheel with drum sticks.1


 He made a 
cameo appearance in the 



1968 film


 starring the 
Monkees, 
Head, with a talking cow. He also made a cameo appearance on an episode of the Monkees' TV series entitled  The Monkees Blow Their Minds  (air date: 3/11/68). Here, he was shown  playing  a car by beating it into submission. This is done in a Monkees-style montage to the Zappa song  Mother People  after being interviewed by Monkee 


Michael Nesmith

. Zappa agreed to appear on the show provided he could be Nesmith. Nesmith liked the idea, so long as he could be Zappa. The two wore cheap, exaggerated disguises and the interview was performed as if Mike was Frank and Frank was Mike.


 He appeared on 
What's My Line? in 1971, during the show's syndicated run, as a mystery guest.2







 Zappa was the host and musical guest of a season four episode of 

Saturday Night Live
 in October 1978. His odd sense of humor and constant mugging to the camera has led 

Lorne Michaels
 to ban this episode,2 just like he banned the episodes hosted by 

Louise Lasser
 (from season one) and 

Milton Berle
 (also from season four). This, however, proved to be temporary as the Zappa episode has been rerun a few times on NBC. In the same show he portrayed 







Connie Conehead's






 date. He was also part of another skit, entitled  Night of Freak Mountain , in which Zappa met with a couple hippies who offered various drugs to him, which he declined, stating  I don't do drugs.  The hippies regarded his statement in awe and surprise. As part of the musical performance of  I'm The Slime  (on an earlier episode hosted by 



Candice Bergen


), the transparent screen of a fake television monitor fills up with a slimy green goo.


 He played a 
drug dealer in the episode  Payback  of TV show 

Miami Vice
.


 He played Attilla the Hunchback in 

Shelley Duvall
's Faerie Tale Theatre, in the episode titled  The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About the Shivers  (1984).


 Zappa was the voice of 
the Pope in the 
1992 
Ren and Stimpy episode  
Powdered Toast Man .






Portraits






Frank Zappa-statue by Vaclav Cesak in Bad Doberan


 



 In 1995 a cast of Zappa was installed in the center of 

Vilnius
, the capital of 



Lithuania


. Zappa was immortalized by Konstantinas Bogdanas, the Lithuanian sculptor who had previously cast portraits of 


Vladimir Lenin

.


 In 2002, a bronze bust was installed in a square in 

Bad Doberan
, a small town in the north of 

Germany
, where, since 1990, there has been an annual international festival celebrating the music of Frank Zappa, the  Zappanale .3






Things named after Zappa



In the 1980s, biologist Ed Murdy named a 
genus of 
gobiid fishes of New Guinea 
Zappa after Zappa, stating that he liked  his music... his politics and principles  and that  the name itself is a good one for scientific nomenclature. 4 


Biologist Ferdinando Boero named a 
phialellid jellyfish 
Phialella zappai5 in order to get the chance to meet the singer. A Zappa concert in Genoa focused largely on the jellyfish and on Dr. Boero. A small portion of this concert was released on  as  Lonesome Cowboy Nando .6 Zappa stated,  There is nothing I'd like better than to have a jellyfish named after me. 7 


Other species named after Zappa include a fossil snail named 
Amaurotoma zappa and the 

Cameroon
ese spider 




Pachygnatha zappa



, so named because a marking on the female's ventral surface resembles the Zappa mustache.8 A gene of the bacterium 
Proteus mirabilis that causes urinary tract infecti is named ZapA (others are named ZapB through ZapE).9 


After his death, an internet campaign to the 
International Astronomical Union's 
Minor Planet Center led to an 
asteroid being named in his honor: 




3834 Zappafrank



, the asteroid having been discovered by Czech astronomers in 1980.1011

One of the many fountains in the Villa Comunale of Naples.



The Villa Comunale is the most prominent and visible park in 


Naples

, southern 



Italy


. It was built in the 1780s by 
King Ferdinand IV (later known as Ferdinand I of the 
Two Sicilies) on land reclaimed along the coast between the main body of the city and the small port of 
Mergellina. The park was originally a  Royal Garden , reserved for members of the royal family, but open to the public on special holidays such as the Festival of 
Piedigrotta. The park was opened to the general public on a permanent basis in 1869 after the unification of 



Italy


.

The park houses the 







Anton Dohrn






 aquarium, a renowned scientific institution built in the 1870s.  The seaside road, via 

Caracciolo
, which now lies between the aquarium and the sea, is another more recent reclamation project added to the city in 1900 to provide another connecting road between the city and the suburbs to the west.

 The only incarnation of the 







Heidi






 series to reach the United States was an English dubbed version of the 1979 feature-length movie adaptation of the TV series, released on video in 1985. Most fans of the series in North America saw it first in other countries.




Reception


Heidi, Girl of the Alps is still popular in Japan today: the love for Heidi has drawn thousands of Japanese 
tourists to the 


Swiss Alps

.1




English Versions



Despite this series' international popularity, it is less well-known in the English language in the United States.  The entire series has been redubbed into English on two separate occasions - first in the late 1970s, when the series was shown in the 

Philippines
, and again in 
2001 for broadcast in 

India
 on Cartoon Network.  



U.S. Release



However, the only version of the Heidi anime to have been commercially released in the United States is the feature-length movie version of the TV series, released in Japanese theaters in 
1979 and directly to home video in the U.S. sometime in the 1980s under the title The Story of Heidi. The American version was produced by Claudio Guzman and Charles Ver Halen and featured a voice cast including 

Randi Kiger
 as Heidi, 
Billy Whitaker as Peter, 
Michelle Laurita as Clara, 

Vic Perrin
 as Alm-Ohi, and legendary voice talent 






Janet Waldo





 as Aunt Dete. (
1)





Movie


A feature length film was edited from the series in 
1979 by Zuiyo (which by then was a separate entity from Nippon Animation, which employed many of the TV series' animation staff). All cast were replaced excluding Heidi and the grandfather. This movie is also the only incarnation of the Heidi anime to have been released commercially in America in English (on home video in the 1980s). Isao Takahata remarked  Neither Hayao Miyazaki nor I are completely related to any shortening version  on this work.




Trivia





Peter, Clara, Heidi, and her Dog Joseph






The opening credit roll was animated by 





Hayao Miyazaki




, except for two scenes by experienced animator 





Yasuji Mori




. Assigned to animate a ring dance of Heidi and Peter, Mori wanted to analyze a movement of two real people, so Miyazaki and animation director Yoichi Kotabe did a ring dance in a parking lot next to their studio, and Mori shot them with an 8mm camera for reference.







In the Spanish version, the name of the dog is  Niebla  (Fog).







In the Italian version, the name of the dog is  Nebbia  (Fog).







In the Brazilian Portuguese version, the name of the dog is  Nevoa  (Fog).







In the Spanish version, many scenes were deleted with no justification.

The Union Trust Building (435 
Grant St., downtown 

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
), was erected in 1915-16 by the industrialist 

Henry Clay Frick
. The Flemish-Gothic structure's original purpose was to serve as a shopping arcade. Known as the Union Arcade, it featured 240 shops and galleries. The 
mansard roof is adorned with terra cotta 
dormers and two chapel like mechanical towers. The interior is arranged about a central rotunda, capped by a stained glass dome. The building is listed on the 





National Register of Historic Places




.


Designed by 





Frederick J. Osterling




, the building was constructed on the site of Pittsburgh's nineteenth century St. Paul's Catholic Cathedral. The Union Trust Company purchased the structure in 1923, renaming it from the Union Arcade to the Union Trust Building, as well as remodeling the first four floors. Its current owner is the 
Mellon Financial Corporation and shares the title  2 Mellon Center.


The building's unique roof is the result of a restrictive covenant placed on the land by its previous owner, the Diocese of Pittsburgh. The bishop at the time placed the restrictive covenant on the land when Frick purchased it so that, although it would now have commercial purposes, residents would always remember the cathedral once stood there.

Childer Thornton





Childer Thornton is a village on the 







Wirral Peninsula






, 

Cheshire
, 

England
, located between 

Hooton
 and 

Little Sutton
.


The busy 



A41 road


 runs through the middle of Childer Thornton. Despite this, the area is relatively unspoilt, with the 





M53 motorway




 effectively diverting away the bulk of through traffic.


The village has three 
pubs, one school and a garden centre. Childer Thornton is exactly half way in distance between 

Birkenhead
 and 

Chester
 and one of the pubs is named 'The Halfway House', which was a stage coach stop between Chester and 

New Ferry
 in the 1770's.1 Childer Thornton's other pubs are 'The Burleydam' and 'The White Lion'.


Childer Thornton is in the 
Anglican 
parish of Hooton, with an attractive parish church made of local sandstone, situated just outside the village itself. It was built between 1858 and 1862, at a cost of  5,000.2

According to 


Herodotus

, when the 
Chersonese on the 
Hellespont came under Athens' rule, 
Miltiades the son of 

Cimon
 came from 








Elaeus







 on the Chersonese to 


Lemnos

 where he proclaimed the 
Pelasgians must submit. The Hephaestians obeyed, giving up their city Hefaestia, but the Myrinaeans from the city Myrina would not be as easily pursued until they too submitted to Athens, thus given control of the island to Miltiades and the Athenians. (Herodotus: The Histories (ed. A. D. Godley, 1920), Cambridge. Harvard University Press. Cited Febr 2004 from The Perseus Project)

The municipality's economically active population in 2001 was 3,007. Of them, 14.5% were employers, 12% self-employed, 65.4% wage-earners, 4.1% unpaid, auxiliary family members, and 4% did not declare line of occupation. Of the economically active population, 6.7% worked in agriculture, 4% in light manufacturing, 12.3% in construction, 8.5% in hotels   restaurants, and the rest in other lines of business (source: 2001 Census, National Statistical Service of Greece).


The town of Myrina


Modern day Myrina is built upon a shallow bay split into two by a promontory jutting out to sea and carrying the ruins of a 

Venetian
 castle. To the north of the promontory lies the so-called Roman Shore (in Greek,                 ), along which the Greek community had their homes during Ottoman times (prior to 1913). To the south of the promontory lies the so-called Turkish Shore (in Greek,                  ), along which the Turkish community similarly had their homes, before the exchange of populations between modern Greece and modern Turkey.


In 2001 the town had 3,022 regular dwellings, of which 30.4% were stone-built, and 75.6% had pitched roofs made of red tiles (source: 18.3.2001 Census, National Statistical Service of Greece).

Town quarters


Behind the fronts of the two Shores, the town is divided into 4 parts: the old town core (encompassing the aforementioned Shores), referred to as Kastro (after the Castle atop the promontory); Androni, to the north (where the women of prehistoric Lemnos are said to have drugged their men before tossing them from the cliff of Petasos (the north horn of the bay of Myrina)); Tchas (most probably from the Russian word        , which means sentinel, sentry, or guard - due to there being a Russian garrison stationed there for a short time at the end of the 18th c.; less probably from the Russian word    , which means hour), just behind the harbour area; and Nea Madetos, a new (post-1980) settlement of workers and fishermen's houses on the hill overlooking the Turkish shore from the south. The heart of the town is the market street, running north to south, and joining the Roman Shore to the Turkish Shore. Other landmarks are the OTE (Hellenic Telecoms Organisation) square, also called the bank square because it is the hub of all bank branches of the island, halfway along the market street, and the Perivola square, behind the Roman Shore, where the Lemnos bus station is (providing bus service from Myrina to the villages and back). The Town Hall building is located in the harbour, near the Port Authority building. Myrina also boasts a good provincial hospital, in the Tchas quarter, while presently is in the process of modernising its sewage system.

Town features


Many of the town's streets are stone-paved alleys. The Roman Shore in particular is quite beautiful, aligned as it is with stone-built houses of neoclassical design (built from the mid-19th to the early 20th century), where the island's rich Greeks lived (many of the houses are still occupied by the descendants of those Greeks, most of whom made their fortunes in Egypt, part of the Greek diaspora there). The archaeological museum displays numerous exhibits from the island's remote (mostly prehistoric) past. With its clean, long, and sandy beaches, and its own Castle to boot, Myrina is a tourist attraction (although in recent years it suffers from increasing noise pollution from vehicles, motorcycles, night clubs and musical taverns, rubbish collection, and church bells, in combination). Visitors and locals like bathing in the Roman Shore (or the Shallow Waters (in Greek,          ) beach, adjacent to the Roman Shore on the north), and having dinner at one of the fish taverns circling the traditional harbour in the Turkish Shore, enjoying the caiques there and a view of the castle at night. During the summer Myrina holds various outside theatrical and musical events.

Comics creators|Created by

William Christensen




Pandora is a fictional character created by William Christensen, Editor in Chief of 

Avatar Press
 
comics. 


Background



From Avatar Press' site:






 

Considered by many to be one of Avatar's flagship characters, Pandora was the very first creation published by Avatar Press -- the original Pandora #1, released in November 1996, was Avatar's debut release. Ever since, the mysterious and alluring Girl of Myth has proven to be one of Avatar's most popular and enduring characters, starring in numerous mini-series, specials, Threshold serials, and crossovers (including Pandora/Avengelyne, and Pandora/Razor).

Centuries old but with body and spirit as young and strong as the day she was created, Pandora's saga has encompassed a huge variety of stories -- from the epic heights of myth to the horror of the denizens of Hell itself, from the drama of open struggle and war to the furtive intrigue of the conflict with the demons who hide among us, Pandora's story has unfolded with ancient magic and modern science, old enemies struggling in the new world.''

American physicians




James R. Privitera, Jr., M.D. is an 








American







 
physician who has been involved in several controversial forms of 
alternative medicine and 
nutrition.


Education and publications



Privitera graduated in 1962 with a 
Bachelor of Science in Biology and Chemistry from 

Canisius College
. After taking graduate Biochemistry courses at 

University at Buffalo, The State University of New York
, he earned an 
M.D. from 

Creighton University
 in 1967. He did a one year 
internship in 
internal medicine at Providence Hospital, 

Seattle, Washington
, then a one-year 
residency at Presbyterian Hospital, 

San Francisco, California
. From 1969-1970 Privitera took a Clinical Fellowship in Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology at 


The Scripps Research Institute

. He has practiced in 

Covina, California
 since 1970. 1


Privitera is author of a book promoting the health benefits of olive leaf extract2, and another on use of 
live blood analysis to detect  silent clots .3




Laetrile controversy and legal ramifications



In 1975, Privitera was convicted of selling 
laetrile, an illegal and ineffective alternative treatment for 
cancer.4 Privitera was sentenced to six months imprisonment in California but appealed the decision. 5 The case led to a 





Supreme Court of California




 decision in 1979. Citing 
Roe v. Wade, Privitera's lawyers contended that the right to obtain laetrile is a fundamental 
right of privacy. 6 The 
California Court of Appeal overturned the conviction citing a 
compelling interest, and the state appealed. 7 The Supreme Court of California ruled 5 to 2 that the right to obtain drugs of unproven efficacy is not encompassed by the right of privacy embodied in either the State or Federal Constitutions. The majority wrote that  the lesson of Roe v. Wade for our case is that a requirement that a drug be certified effective for its intended use is a reasonable means to 'insure maximum safety for the patient.'  8 Privitera was unsuccessful in an attempt to have the 

Supreme Court of the United States
 review the case. 9 Consequently Privitera had his medical license temporarily suspended and he was placed on 10 years' probation. 10 Having exhausted all his legal appeals in 1982, he served about two months in prison, but was soon 
pardoned by California governor 

Jerry Brown
 after the governor received more than 10,000 letters from citizens asking him to do so.11 Privitera, who was also granted a license to practice medicine in Colorado in 1983, was also put on probation in that State in 1986, solely because of the temporary suspension of his California licence. 12 In 1987, the State of California moved, unsuccessfully, to revoke his probation and end his practice. 13 James Privitera is still in practice in Covina, California. 1




Live blood analysis controversy





Main article: 







Live blood analysis









During his probationary period, Privitera, a proponent of the unproven 
alternative medical technique of 
live blood analysis (LBA), founded two companies for commercializing LBA, Livcell Analysis and NutriScreen.14 Privitera's work was defended with the argument that  orthodox medicine has worked overtime to prevent [LBA's] acceptance in the medical community. 1


In 2001, the 
Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General issued a report on regulation of  unestablished laboratory tests  such as live blood analysis.15




Disciplinary action



In 1999, a patient's death led to action by 


California Attorney General

 

Bill Lockyer
. According to the charges, a 71-year old patient with multiple medical problems had been seeing Privitera since 1991. She came to his office in March 1999 while she had been suffering from pain in the left arm for a few days. While in the waiting room she complained of a headache and asked for Tylenol. She was treated with 20,000 units of the 
anticoagulant 
heparin under the tongue and subsequently with another 20,000 units subcutaneously while in Privitera s office. The woman collapsed shortly after and his staff called 911. She was taken to the hospital 
comatose and bleeding from several orifices. The emergency room tests showed she was fully anticoagulated and unable to stop the bleeding in her head. She was declared 
brain dead and died the next morning.


The State charged Privitera with gross negligence, repeated negligent acts, incompetence, prescribing without indication, and inadequate records. 16 Prior to trial, in a plea bargain with the State, Privitera admitted to  failing to perform an adequate history and physical of a patient before commencing treatment and failing to maintain adequate and accurate records of the care and treatment provided to a patient in the manner set forth in the Accusation,  all other charges were dropped 16 and he was reprimanded, fined and required to take courses on prescribing practices and recordkeeping by the California Board of Quality Medical Assurance for the above admission.16




Criticism



Privitera has been criticized by 


Stephen Barrett

 for his involvement in several controversial practices, including laetrile, 
calcium pangamate, and 
DMSO.17 Scott Tips explains the following about Barrett:  in 1998, the self-proclaimed  quackbuster  Stephen Barrett sued Dr. Privitera for defamation because of certain statements appearing in the book that were critical of Barrett.  However, Barrett lost this suit when the court granted a summary-judgment motion in favor of Dr. Privitera.  1

1921 elections







Social Democratic leader Hjalmar Branting




The Swedish general election held in 1921 (

Swedish
: Riksdagsmannavalet till andra kammaren), was the General election to the second chamber of the Swedish 
Diet, (the 
Riksdag), and the first fully democratically elected 
Parliament of 







Sweden






. The Social Democratic Party with leader 

Hjalmar Branting
 formed its 
second government.


In 1921, a universal and equal 
franchise was introduced for men and women alike, and the Riksdag finally achieved a system of democratic representation for all 
citizens who were at least 23 years old on election day. Nevertheless, it was still possible, even after 1921, to exclude certain groups from the right to vote. An example was individuals who had been declared incapable of managing their own affairs by a court of law. This limitation of the franchise disappeared only in 
1989 when the Riksdag abolished 
incapacitation.


Alongside the universal franchise reform, a 
parliamentary system of government developed and gained acceptance, implying that the government requires the Riksdag's confidence and support for all major decisions. As of 1921, all major treaties with foreign states had to be approved by the Riksdag, and the two chambers of the Riksdag now elected their own 
Speakers along with two deputy speakers each.

Before the elections in 1921, the Swedish Socialist Left Party accepted 
Lenin's April Theses, and accordingly split in two parties: the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Left Party - a party which was formed by some 6,000 socialists who hade been excluded by the communists as non-revolutionary elements.

Evadne Price (1896/1901-1985) (pseudonym Helen Zenna Smith) was a 

British
 
freelance 
journalist, 
columnist, 
author, 
playwright, 
actor, 
television presenter, 
screenwriter, and 
astrologer. She is well  remembered for her serialized romance novels under her Helen Zenna Smith pseudonym, her children's books featuring the character of 


Jane Turpin

 and as the Astrology columnist for the SHE magazine. However, she is arguably best remembered as the author of the feminist reprise to the novel 





All Quiet on the Western Front




 titled , a semi-biographical novel based on 

World War I
 which was brought into prominence by 
The Feminist Press reprint of 1989.


Birth and early years


Evadne Price was born at sea off the coast of 




New South Wales



, 

Australia
 to English parents. The 
National Union Catalogue lists her birthdate as 1896, but Kenneth Attiwill (her second husband of 54 years) claims she was born in 1901. She was educated in New South Wales and 

England
. She first worked as an actor in 

London
, and then turned to journalism. She wrote a column for the 
Sunday Chronicle and other newspapers.




Journalism and the war



Many of Price's stories are set in a backdrop of the World Wars. Price's semi-biographical sketch of a group of ambulance drivers in 

World War I
 -  (1930), received critical acclaim, and was published under her pseudonym. A British publisher initially approached Price to write a spoof on 



Erich Maria Remarque


's 





All Quiet on the Western Front




. Price managed to persuade him to publish an account of a woman's experience of the war instead. She contacted Winnifred Young, a British ambulance driver who had kept war diaries to provide her with a basis for her story. It was translated into French as  Pas Si Calme  by 
Gallimard, 

Paris
 in 1931. Also translated into Dutch; a trilogy  Gij vrouwen ....! ,  Vrouwen in nood  and  Vrouwenroeping .


During 







World War II






, Price was the war correspondent for The People from 1943, covering the 

Allied invasion
 and all of the major war stories through the 












Nuremberg Trials











. Her husband was a 
POW in 
Japan, and was presumed dead for two years.




Romance novel author



Evadne Price was a very successful romance novelist and wrote 
romance novels under the pseudonym Helen Zenna Smith. Some of her books were serialized in the weekly British weekly The People. Several hundred of her novels were serialized in the 
Novel magazine.  Among her more popular books were Society Girl, Glamour Girl, Escape to Marriage, and Air Hostess in Love.




Playwright and screenwriter



Price's career as a romance novelist took her into playwriting, radio scriptwriting and screenwriting. Her play Big Ben, written for the 
Malvern Festival in 1939, was a successful one (
The Times called it  a large, comfortable play with a soul to call its own ). The Phantom Light (1937) was a stage version of her novel, The Haunted Light. The play was also made into a film starring 


Gordon Harker

. Once a Crook (1939) - a play which was co-written by Price and her husband Kenneth Attiwill, was also both a play and a film. She also acted in the movie 
Trouble with Junia (1967) in the minor part of Miss Hallyday beside her husband Ken Attiwill.




Jane Turpin stories



Evadne Price is also remembered for her children's stories, which she often published in magazines. Her most well known creation in this field was 


Jane Turpin

, often referred to as the  Female 








William







  and serialized in the Novel magazine from 1928. Price, however, did not take kindly to Jane stories being referred to as a copy of the William series. She went on record saying she  had never heard of William , even though William stories were regularly advertised on Jane book dust jackets. The famous illustrator 
Thomas Henry Fisher, who illustrated both Jane and William books, even signed the illustrations for the Jane books as  Marriott  so as to distinguish the two series.




Astrology


Evadne Price had another parallel career as a broadcaster during the early years of 
British television. Her afternoon horoscope show called  Fun with the Stars  led to a long-running evening horoscope program. Price was dubbed the  new astrologer extraordinaire  for twenty-five years for the SHE magazine and published a successful collection of these columns as SHE Stargazes. When she and her husband retired to Australia in 1976, Evadne Price wrote the monthly horoscope column for 
Australian Vogue.




Final Years



Evadne Price died on 
April 17, 
1985 in 

Sydney
, Australia. Evadne Price has an unfinished autobiography which was to have been named Mother Painted Nude.

Plot summary



Bike messenger Jace Damon attempts to live under the radar in Los Angeles with his younger brother (Tyler, who has an IQ of 168). The two are raised by their mother, who does her best to remain anonymous. When she falls ill Jace takes her to the hospital, making sure that he is not associated with her. The mother dies, and her children cannot claim her body. Instead, Jace takes his brother to find a new place, deciding that the Chinese community would be the best for them; eventually an elderly Chinese businesswoman (Madame Chen) takes a liking to the pair of boys and gives Jace a part-time job and a place to stay. He also takes a job as a bike messenger, since he can be paid in cash for it. 


One night, Jace accepts a delivery just as he is about to go off-duty; it is a pickup from the office of one of L.A.'s sleaziest defense attorneys, Lenny Lowell. He is not happy about the late delivery since it is a wet miserable night, but the dispatcher tells him that everyone else has gone off duty, and he is the only one available.  Lowell is extremely (despite his reputation) nice to Jace, giving him a good tip.  When Jace approaches the delivery address, he finds an empty lot which makes him nervous, so he decides to abort the delivery. Before he can get away, a large black car comes racingt towards him to run him down. He barely survives the collision and is forced to abandon his bike. On foot, he is able to elude his pursuer, but loses his delivery bag (but retains the package). Jace returns to the scene of the collision and is relieved to discover that he will only have to replace the wheel. He returns to Lowell's office, only to find it crawling with police; he learns that Lowell has been murdered. Jace does not trust police, so he leaves the scene. 


In a city fueled by money, celebrity and sensationalism, the slaying of a bottom-feeder like Lowell won't make headlines.  So when LAPD's elite show up, homicide detective Kev Parker (assigned to Lowell's case) wants to know why.  Parker begins a search for answers that will lead him to a killer--or to the end of his career.  Because if there's one lesson Parker has learned over the years, it's that in a town built on fame and fantasy, delivering the truth can be murder.

Bishops of Dover
Anglican suffragan bishops in the Diocese of Canterbury







 



 
Anglicanism portal




The Bishop of Dover is an 
episcopal title given to a 
suffragan bishop in the 

Church of England
 
Diocese of Canterbury, 

England
.1 The title takes its name after the town of 

Dover
 in 

Kent
.  Unlike the other three suffragans in the diocese, he holds the additional title of  Bishop in Canterbury  and is empowered to act almost as if he were the 
diocesan bishop of Canterbury, since the actual diocesan bishop (the 










Archbishop of Canterbury









) is so frequently away fulfilling national and international duties. Among other things, this gives the Bishop of Dover an ex officio seat in the Church's 
General Synod.

150px





Robert Walter Quarry (born 
November 3, 
1925) is an 








American actor







. He is known for his 
horror film roles.


Quarry was born in 
Santa Rosa, 

California
, the son of Mable and Paul Quarry, a doctor.1 His films include 

Count Yorga, Vampire
 (1970), its sequel 

The Return of Count Yorga
 (1971), and 

Dr. Phibes Rises Again
 (1972), in which he was pitted against 


Vincent Price

 in a race to find the mythical 
elixir of eternal life. Price did not care for his co-star - once, when Quarry was singing in his dressing room during the making of Dr Phibes Rises Again, he said to Price,  You didn't know I could sing did you?  and Price replied:  Well I knew you couldn't act.  American International Pictures had plans for Quarry to succeed Price, but the decline in the company's fortunes, and old style horror films falling out of fashion, meant that it never happened. Quarry's career was further set back by a road accident that resulted in serious facial injuries, but he made several memorable guest appearances on TV shows, notably the 1977 
Rockford Files episode,  Requiem For a Funny Box,  as Lee Russo.

Military units and formations established in 1867
United States Navy organization




NOTE: This article is about a Naval organization.  For the Army Corps of Engineers, see 

United States Army Corps of Engineers
.

The Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) is a staff corps of the 






United States Navy





. CEC officers are professional 
engineers and 
architects, acquisitions specialists and 
Seabee Combat Warfare Officers.  They are responsible for executing and managing the planning, design, acquisition, construction, operation, and maintenance of the Navy's shore facilities.  CEC ranks range from 
CWO2 to 
VADM (N4 of the U.S. Navy).  The Civil Engineer Corps is under the command of the 
Chief of Civil Engineers, currently RADM 
Wayne Shear Jr..



 Insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps 



Civil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintend the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk. Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the 
Bureau of Yards and Docks until 1870, when their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July of that year fixing the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list, and appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of  Pay of the Navy .


The discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain (
CAPT), two with that of commander (
CDR), three with that of lieutenant-commander (
LCDR), and four with that of lieutenant (
LT).


The Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, which is a distinguishing mark of the line - with the following distinctive marks and devices instead of those worn by other officers:

 Shoulder straps - border embroidered gold, body light blue cloth and the letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.


 The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets. 




In 1905 two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two live oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called  Crossed Bananas ), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps in lieu of the Old English letters C.E., and worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat. While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by the enlisted sailors in the construction field in the pay grades of E-3 and below.

Regional Security System
Defence organisations based in Barbados




The Regional Security System (RSS) is an international agreement for the defence and security of the eastern 





Caribbean




 region.
The Regional Security System was created out of a need for collective response to security threats, which were impacting on the stability of the region in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In October 1982 four members of the 

Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States
, namely 
Antigua and Barbuda, 

Dominica
, 
St. Lucia, 
St. Vincent and the Grenadines signed a 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) with 



Barbados


 to provide for  mutual assistance on request . 
Saint Kitts and Nevis joined following independence in 1983, and 

Grenada
 followed two years later, after 
Operation Urgent Fury, a combined U.S. and RSS invasion of the country. The MOU was updated in 1992 and the system acquired juridical status in March 1996 under the Treaty which was signed at 
St. Georges, Grenada.

The RSS initially started as a U.S. instrument to combat the spread of Communism in the Caribbean region.

Old Japanese texts




Ishinp  (   , ishinp  or ishinh ) is the oldest surviving 
Japanese medical text. It was written by 
Yasuyori Tamba in 
984 and is 30 volumes in length.  The work is based on the 

Chinese
 
Bing Yuanhou lun, written by 

Sui Dynasty
 author 
Chao Yuanf ng. Many of the Ishinp  texts have been lost in China, and have only survived to the present day through their inclusion in the work.

The structural organization of the text is as follows:

The Ishinp  is notable for preserving some of the 
Taoist sexual manuals from the Han to the Tang dynasty. The twenty-eighth section of the Ishinp  contains a complete transcription of a Daoist text known as The Classic of Sunu which is a dialogue between the Dark Maiden provides advice on sexual practices to the 





Yellow Emperor




.


While the text is written in 
kanbun, 

Japanese
 terms are written to the side in 
Man'y gana for plants, animals, and minerals.

Gambling regulation
Organizations established in 2004
State agencies of Pennsylvania




The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board is a governmental agency of the Commonwealth of 





Pennsylvania




, founded in 2004 as the state licensing and regulatory agency responsible for overseeing 
slot machines and 
casino gambling in the state. The first completely new agency created in Pennsylvania in over 30 years, the PGCB administers the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act, also known as  Act 71 , and its regulations to assure public trust and confidence in the credibility and integrity of casinos in Pennsylvania. 

The PGCB does not oversee games of chance in the Commonwealth such as the 





Pennsylvania Lottery




 or other permitted games of chance at clubs and non-profit organizations.



Composition


The board consists of seven voting members, three of which are appointed by the 
Governor of Pennsylvania and four of which are appointed by the leadership of the 
Pennsylvania General Assembly.1 By statute, the State Treasurer, Secretary of Revenue, and Secretary of Agriculture are non-voting 
ex-officio members.2




Economic effects of slots gambling


Revenue produced from slot machines in Pennsylvania go to property tax relief and rebates, the horse racing industry, economic development, tourism, and the local governments of gambling establishments. It also funds the PGCB and other enforcement agencies, so that there is no taxpayer burden to pay for the oversight of this industry.


The PGCB estimates that slot machines will produce 15,000 new casino jobs, and 24,000 jobs in construction.3




Casino licenses


The board is authorized to issue up to 14 licenses for slot machine operations only. Seven licenses may be issued to existing horse race tracks, or 
racinos, five licenses may be issued to stand-alone casinos, and two licenses may be issued to existing hotel 
resorts. All can have up to 5,000 machines, except the last two resort licensees, which can have up to 500. The Act also mandated that two of the five stand-alone casinos be located in 
Philadelphia, one in 

Pittsburgh
, and the remaining two at-large. As of July 2008, 11 of the licenses have been awarded.  The remaining three are in the licensing process and include one more racino license and the two smaller resort licenses.



Racinos


On December 20, 2006, the board voted to grant six permanent casino licenses for existing 
horse racing facilities.4 The board previously voted to grant these locations temporary licenses on 
September 27, 2006.5 The licensed facilities are:



Harrah's Chester Casino and Racetrack in Chester


Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in Wilkes-Barre


Philadelphia Park Casino in Bensalem


Hollywood Casino at Penn National in Grantville


Presque Isle Downs and Casino in Erie


Meadows Racetrack   Casino in Washington






Stand-alone casinos


On the same day, the board voted to grant five permanent casino licenses for stand-alone casinos. The licensed facilities are:











SugarHouse Casino






, 
Philadelphia (yet to begin construction)


Foxwoods Casino 
Philadelphia (yet to begin construction) 


Majestic Star Casino 

Pittsburgh
 (opening 2nd or 3rd quarter 2009)

History


It was established in 1880 and named for the first postmaster in 1891, Vashti Strahan.   Bypassed by the 
Fort Worth and Denver Railway in 1882 and 




U.S. Route 287



 in the 1930s, the town never flourished.  It did survive, however, as a local economic and social hub for area farmers.  It reached its peak population in the 1920s at 264, and the community had a number of businesses, including a cotton gin, three general stores, a drugstore, and a blacksmith shop; in addition, six churches and two fraternal orders operated locally. Its decline began in the 1950s as the urbanization of rural areas began across the United States following 







World War II






.   By 1950 the population of Vashti stood at 140, which remained stable until 1980. Cattle raising, dairy farming, potterymaking, and fruit production are the area's major industries.




Education


Vashti is served by the

The left margin of heart (or obtuse margin) is shorter than the 
right border of heart, full, and rounded: it is formed mainly by the 
left ventricle, but to a slight extent, above, by the 
left atrium. 

It extends from a point in the second left 
intercostal space, about 2.5 mm. from the 
sternal margin, obliquely downward, with a convexity to the left, to the 
apex of the heart.

The Longest Journey characters




Character in the adventure game 





The Longest Journey




.

Abnaxus is the Venar ambassador to the Ayrede Council, and keeper of Venar Stone, their piece of the Stone Disk. While he lives in the City Green of 
Marcuria, his true home is north of the Border Mountains. His wife is Abyanda, and his daughters are Abratha, Abelexe and Abpalmana.


Many players of 





TLJ




 have a love-hate relationship with Abnaxus, due to his lengthy, grammatically tense-challenged speeches. The dialogue goes a long way towards helping us understand what it is like to be a Venar, but he does tend to go on. He went on. He will go on. He will have been going on.


Abnaxus also has quite an eclectic collection of books, including:





Ruminations on the Chaos Principle, by Ror Agastanja


The Death of a Venar, by Ge'le


A Brief History of the Northlands, by Minstrum Lenyer


The Psychology of Stickmen, by G. Godager


Principles of Waging a Winning War Against Superior Forces, by General Hen Solber


Surviving the Border Mountains, by Tomi Strande




and even 





The Lord of the Rings




, by J. R. R. Tolkien.


----
The old website for The Longest Journey had Abnaxus give a rather 
foggy (well, normal for him) info session on the Venar, the veil and the coming of the Kan-ang-la:


 No, friend, I am not. For she will come. 


 I am Abnaxus of the Venar. I am an ambassador to the land of Ayrede, and the city of Marcuria has been my home now for a time. How long? I do not know, friend. My people do not know of time. We do not live in the now. We live in the always. 


 Farewell. 


 No, do not be confused. To speak to you is often a difficult task for me, for I may answer questions not yet asked, or questions asked a time ago. To even make myself understood demands greatly of me, and it is a skill acquired by study. I am the only one of my people to speak with 
outsiders. For the others it is too difficult, and they may reveal your future yet to be, or a future that will never be, or a past hidden by chance or choice. To speak with my people is to enter the true mind of the Venar, and for outsiders, that may not be a pleasant experience. 


 There is a veil in our path, however; a veil I cannot see past. We exist to that point, and at all points previous, but not beyond. For us, this sense of the unknown is like losing our sight. We are 
blinded. But we know of one person who is to lead us through the veil, to the other side. The Lady will one day unite the worlds, she will be the mother of a new world -- but first, she will lead us through the 
veil.  


 Am I afraid? 


 We are of 
trees, friend, and trees are of us. We plant the trees, and we care for them, and the trees care for us in return. A tree grows over time, yet it has always been there, and it always will be. And any moment is an eternity. Any moment is a lifetime. Do we die? I am dead, in this moment. I am born, in this moment. Any moment is all moments. 


 You wish to go? 


 No, friend, I am not. For she will come. 
----


Abnaxus is voiced by Jeff Meller.

Mountains of the Australian Capital Territory




This is a list of mountains in the Australian Capital Territory. It includes all mountains with a gazetted name.

This list is complete with respect to the 1996 
Gazetteer of Australia.1 Dubious names have been checked against the online 2004 data,2 and in all cases confirmed correct. However, if any mountains have been gazetted or deleted since 1996, this list does not reflect these changes. Strictly speaking, Australian place names are gazetted in capital letters only; the names in this list have been converted to mixed case in accordance with normal capitalisation conventions. Locations are as gazetted.

Private First Class Dick Simmons is a main 
fictional character in the 
machinima 
comic science fiction video series 








Red vs. Blue







. He is voiced by 



Gustavo Sorola


, co-creator of the series.  Simmons is the second-in-command of the Red Team, a position strengthened by his sycophantic demeanour to his superior, 

Sarge
.  Along with 

Grif
, Simmons is one of the first characters to ever appear in Red vs. Blue; the pair debuted at the start of 








episode 1







.



Character overview



Simmons acts as the 
straight man of the Red Team, usually acting rationally and thinking level-headedly.  When one of the other members of the Red Team concocts an implausible theory or plan, Simmons denounces the suggestion and gives a more logical statement; after one such situation, Sarge and Grif comment that he has no imagination.  Nonetheless, Simmons is often looked to solve problems.  Sarge once labelled him as the  unofficial science officer , which Simmons reasoned as meaning he was smart.  Simmons is extremely devoted to this image, doing whatever possible to appear intelligent to his teammates.  He once claimed he could multiply any two large numbers in his head, and when Grif attempted to test this theory, Simmons gave a false answer in a credible manner, which convinced his teammates.  When 

Church
 told him the other Reds all laughed at him and claimed he wasn't as smart as he pretended to be (see below), Simmons was distraught.


However, when circumstances fail to work in his favor, Simmons tends to break down and behave irrationally.  This is best evidenced in Season Four, when Simmons was demoted for claiming that 
Sheila, the Blue Team's tank, was still roaming Blood Gulch.  His position was filled by 

Donut
, who, in a radio conversation, unwittingly rubbed Simmons' nose in the fact that he, Donut, now had Simmons' job.  In an abrupt fury, Simmons painted his armor mostly blue, attacked the Red Base with Sheila in tow, and captured Grif.  Sarge and Donut's rescue attempt and execution of Simmons was interrupted by the timely arrival of Church, the Blue Team's self-appointed leader, who saved Simmons and sent the Reds back to their base.  Church, pretending not to recognize Simmons, then gave him an orientation on the Red Team's members and gave a scathing opinion of Simmons.  Simmons' reaction of running back to the base to cry shows he is also very self-conscious.  Despite the attempt on his life, Simmons still remains loyal to Sarge and the Red Team.  During the events of Sarge's  death , Simmons helps convince Sarge that he is truly dead, so that he could take command of Red Team.  Later on a  rescue mission  to save Sarge, it is revealed that he has an extreme 
fear of snakes.




Role in the plot


Simmons is first introduced with Grif at the beginning of 








Episode One







, being the first character to speak in the series proper.  Throughout Season One and the first half of Season Two, he acts as a supporting character rather than a focal member of the plot.  This changes in 








Episode 30







, when Simmons is selected by Sarge to be turned into a 
cyborg so the Reds will have someone with mechanical abilities.  Following the operation, Simmons is referred to as Simmons 2.0, although this eventually stopped occurring in Season Three.  Simmons's left-over body parts are then used to save Grif's life, the latter having been run over by Sheila.  Simmons expressed his displeasure at having his organs harvested by Grif after it became apparent that Grif was abusing them as he had done to his own by smoking, drinking and over-eating.


Simmons was instrumental in regrouping the Red/Blue Alliance in Season Three; after a malfunctioning teleporter separated the teams, Simmons, who had been transported to a facility filled with teleporters, managed to find Sarge and 

Caboose
, the Blue Team rookie and transport them to his location, saving them from some bizarrely homicidal characters called the 
Grunts.  After the Alliance had to use the teleporters again to get to Sidewinder, Simmons had to reprogram a teleporter in the facility while simultaneously directing Donut, still in Blood Gulch, to do the same.  According to Rooster Teeth, there was supposed to be a trait involved with his cyborg status that allowed him to manipulate teleporters, seen in the above instances and also to transport the 
Grunts to Sidewinder; however, this trait was eventually left out for pacing reasons.1


After being blasted into the future and the Red Team's re-entry of Blood Gulch, Simmons is exiled from the Red Team by Sarge after claiming Sheila is still inhabiting the canyon (see above).  This leads to Simmons' breakdown and subsequent spying on Church, who allows the ruse to continue so he can abuse Simmons and order him around.  After Church accidentally makes contact with 
Vic Jr., a descendant of their contact, 
Vic, Simmons returns to the Red Team to give them the information he'd learned, changing back into his maroon armor.  Before he is allowed to officially rejoin the team, Sarge and Grif hold a mock trial in which they force him to pay a fine for them to split, on the grounds of 
treason and 
insubordination.  On a few occasions since then, Sarge refers to Simmons as a traitor.  In season five, after burying Sarge, he realizes that there is a giant cavern under Blood Gulch.  He and Grif jump down into the cavern, and Simmons uses his radio to contact Sarge. After reuniting, he helps advance a plan to take over the Blue base and discovers the computer equipment under the cavern is being used to monitor both teams. In 
episode 100, Simmons is briefly taken over by the sinister 
AI, 
O'Malley, but he is chased out after Simmons is beaten up by 

Tex
. In the canon ending, after the (supposed) death of Tex, the soldiers return to their bases, and Simmons and Grif spy on the Blues in a manner almost identical to how the Blues spied on them in Season One, right down to the dialogue.  Sarge then orders them to come and inspect the new vehicle he had built, which Simmons wants to name.


After the conclusion of the Blood Gulch Chronicles, Simmons is transferred out of Blood Gulch to another location, like much of the main cast.  After Sarge was tricked by the Meta into attacking Agent Washington, Sarge regathers Grif and Simmons and pursues them in the Warthog.  They arrive at the windmill facility, but only allow the Meta to recharge by distracting Washington and Church.




Themes



Ethnicity


A recurring theme of Simmons's character is his ethnic background.  Somehow, Grif comes to the conclusion that Simmons is  of a 
Latino persuasion , apparently because he thinks that Simmons is a 
Hispanic name.  This exchange coincides with 
Lopez, the Red Team's robot, having gained the ability to speak, but only in Spanish owing to a damaged voice card; Grif believes that Simmons should know the language and thus should be able to translate.  Simmons, however, maintains that his background is 



Dutch


-

Irish
, but Grif does not believe him, and sometimes makes slurs on Simmons's ethnicity when Lopez is mentioned.  Not mentioned throughout Season Three, the joke was revived in 








Episode 63







, when Donut, acting as a telephone operator, gave instructions in Spanish, and then said  for unconfirmed Dutch-Irish, press one too, as in also .  The whole issue is an 
in-joke based on the 








Mexican







 ethnicity of Simmons' voice actor, Gustavo Sorola.2 However, in 
episode 99, Simmons calls the Wyoming clones  
crackers  and  
honky motherfuckers , prompting Grif to ask why Simmons is using such a slur if he's Dutch-Irish. Simmons simply replies  Fuck that shit! Shut up and drive, bitch!  and continues shooting.




Relationships with other characters


Simmons's main characterisation is brought out through his interaction with his teammates, particularly Sarge.  A compulsive 
sycophant, he supports Sarge almost entirely whole-heartedly, despite the latter's psychopathic and frequently delusional leadership.  Rooster Teeth notes that this was not an initial plan for Simmons; they never intended to have a character act as Sarge's right-hand man. But, because of the relationship shared between Sarge and Grif and the hatred that the former had for the latter, Simmons's relationship with Sarge was naturally formed.3  Initially, he would only decry Sarge's plans if they involved dying for foolish reasons, and even then, he would do so in a subtle manner.  He has referred to Sarge as his father figure, and claims he relies on Sarge for  love and support .  As a result, Grif frequently calls Simmons a  kiss-ass .  Sarge has, on occasion, acknowledged that all Simmons does is act slavishly to him, but does not mind.  Simmons is only frowned upon by Sarge when he outright claims Sarge is wrong, as in the situation where Simmons insisted Sheila had driven past.  Deprived of Sarge's support, Simmons slowly breaks down, and eventually mutinies (his character profile hints at this outcome).4 Despite his overwhelming loyalty to Sarge, it is revealed in Season Five that Simmons has lofty ambitions as Sarge's replacement and was quick to bury Sarge and take over his position.


At the end of the series, Simmons is briefly infected by 
O'Malley, and reveals his dreams to become in charge of Red Team. During his temporary rise in ego as a result of the infection, the motive behind his entire being is summed up in his statement that  Now people will kiss MY ass!  


Simmons outranks Grif and shares Sarge's dislike of him, and thus talks down to and openly expresses his displeasure of him, yet the pair have a 
love-hate relationship, and spend much of their time bickering and chatting with each other, with Simmons reacting to the various outrageous statements that Grif makes. When Simmons becomes an outcast for seeing Sheila, he takes it very hard. Grif tries to convince him to come back to the base, but he is reluctant at first because he believes Grif is merely telling him what he wants to hear. Grif acknowledges this and convinces Simmons that nothing has changed, leading Simmons to say  Ah, good ol' Grif. 





Filming and voice acting


Because Simmons's maroon armour color is similar to the standard issue red that Sarge wears, the producers have used Simmons more flexibly than the other characters.  While filming with the original Halo, characters of two different colors were unable to board the same vehicle at once.  Taking advantage of this, the producers would sometimes film Simmons in red armour so he and Sarge could both sit in their car, the Warthog, as from a distance, the difference in color is difficult to distinguish.25


For some deleted scenes in season 2, as Simmons was getting prepared for his cyborg operation, the script required the character to be drunk; as Gus by his own admission couldn't do a drunk voice, and finding no alternative, Gus decided to get himself drunk.5

American writers




Edward Winterhalder (born 1955) is an American author, entrepreneur, and leading authority on motorcycle clubs.

Author of a historical look into the secret world of 
motorcycle clubs (also known as a  
biker gang  or an  
outlaw motorcycle club ), his autobiography about the time he spent with the 



Bandidos


 Motorcycle Club titled  Out In Bad Standings: Inside The Bandidos Motorcycle Club; The Making Of A Worldwide Dynasty  (ISBN 0-9771-7470-0) was published in November 2005, according to large bookstores like Barnes   Noble
http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=PQ0nHIECoq isbn=0977174700 itm=1 and Amazon
http://www.amazon.com/dp/0977174700/. 


Winterhalder is also a contributing author to  The Mammoth Book of Bikers  (published by London's Constable   Robinson in September of 2007); the co-author, with Canadian motorcycle journalist Wil DeClercq, of  The Assimilation  (published by Canada's ECW Press in June of 2008); and the co-author, with Australian academic Arthur Veno Ph.d., of  Biker Chicks: The Magnetic Attraction of Women to Bad Boys and Motorcycles  (to be published by Australia's Allen   Unwin in June of 2009).


An October 2006 issue of Rockstar Magazine described Winterhalder as being the high ranking member of the 



Bandidos


 responsible for the assimilation of a Canadian 
motorcycle gang known as the 



Rock Machine


 in 2001, which then became the Canadian chapters of the 



Bandidos


. 


An executive producer of the  Living on the Edge  DVD/television reality series, Winterhalder was born in 


New England

,  grew up in 

Connecticut
 and moved to 





Oklahoma




 after serving in the US Army. In 





Oklahoma




 he joined the Rogues Motorcycle Club in the 1970s, and was a close associate and/or a member of the 



Bandidos


 for more than twenty years.


He has been seen on History Television (Canada), the History Channel (USA), the 

CBC
 Canadian TV evening news, been a featured author on Bravo TV's  The Word 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC2UCBTFfXc, and has been quoted by hundreds of magazines and newspapers worldwide such as the 

Seattle Weekly

http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0628/bikers.php, the 
Austin Chronicle
http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A366344, the Sunshine Coast Daily in Australia and 

The Guardian
 in England; the media recognizes him as one of the world's leading authorities on the 



Bandidos


, 
motorcycle clubs and 
bikers. 


Currently a consultant to the entertainment industry for television shows and feature films that focus on the biker lifestyle, the main character Jax in the new series 

Sons of Anarchy
 is partially based on specific aspects of Winterhalder's life as portrayed in his first book  Out In Bad Standings , according to the 
Laconia Citizen
http://www.citizen.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080617/GJNEWS02/992856316 and Bombin' Magazine

Simulated MAC signal. From left to right: digital data, chrominance and luminance




D-MAC is a reduced bandwidth variant designed for transmission down cable. 



 The data is duo-binary coded with a data burst rate of 20.25Mb/s so that 0  as well as  90  phasors are used.


 D-MAC has a bandwidth of 8.4 MHz versus 27 MHz for 
C-MAC.


 Most cable systems work on 
EBU] 7 MHz channel spacing, so this approach did not work universally.


 D-MAC's bandwidth problems were later fixed by D2-MAC.





D2-MAC: A fix for D-MAC


D-MAC consumed too much bandwidth for many applications, so D2-MAC was devised for European cable TV systems.




Luminance and chrominance


MAC transmits luminance and chrominance data separately in time rather than separately in frequency (as other analog television formats do, such as composite video).




Audio and scrambling (selective access)





 Audio, in a format similar to 
NICAM was transmitted digitally rather than as an FM subcarrier.


 The MAC standard included a standard scrambling system, EuroCrypt, a precursor to the standard DVB-CSA encryption system.

Christopher Panzner (
1959 ) is an American writer/producer living and working in France.  He has worked for a number of pioneers in the television and film industry, notably as Technical Director for the inventor of interactive television shopping, the 

Home Shopping Network
 and as Operations Director, France, for the inventor of the 
colorization process for black and white films, Color Systems Technology.  He has developed animation software (Pixibox)1, designed theme channels (

International Emmy in 1994 for French CGI series 

Insektors
 2.  He went on to set up an animation/FX studio (
motion capture/
motion control), Image Effects, where he supervised the creation of 2D animated series The Tidings for 
Entertainment Rights before creating his own studio in the east of France the following year, Talkie Walkie, specializing in pre-production (design, storyboard and layout) and computer production (ink-and-paint/compositing) and whose clients included a Who s Who of international television animation producers such as 
SIP 3, 
RTV Family Entertainment 4, 

Alphanim
 and Cinar (now called Cookie Jar.)5 He joined Paris-based production company TEVA in 2001 and was instrumental in the financing and/or the making of five animated features there in 2002-2004: double-
Oscar nominated 
The Triplets of Belleville, 

Venice Film Festival
 selection The Dog, the General and the Birds 6, Jester Till 7, Blackmor s Treasure 8 (Associate Producer) and Charlie and Mimmo  9 (Co-Producer). In 2002, TEVA and Mistral Films won the grand prize at IMAGINA 10 for an experimental short film, The Tale of the Floating World directed by Alain Escalle11, beating such prestigious competition as 

Shrek
, 
Amelie and 

The Lord of the Rings
, and was entirely responsible for the fabrication of Storimages  Pulcinella-winning 12 and International Emmy-nominated special, Harold Pebble 13, based on the book by famous French illustrator 
Sempe. In 2006, The Triplets of Belleville, The Dog, the General and the Pigeons and Blackmor s Treasure were part of an eight-film retrospective of contemporary French animation at the 

Museum of Modern Art
 in New York called  Grand Illusions: The Best of Recent French Animation.  14  

Mr. Panzner has written original animated television shows, adapted into English a number of other television shows and feature films and writes regularly for Animation World Network 15, 

Animation Magazine

ASIFA, Stylus Magazine 16 and Arts Editor 17.


In 2005, he developed a series (5 X 52') of high-definition television documentaries on communication with animals, Talk to Me, and two one-hour specials, The Hermione and Lafayette, 18 about the reconstruction of the ship the 
Marquis de Lafayette sailed to America on during the 
Revolutionary War for Woods TV, Paris 19.  He also did the English adaptation of Michel Fessler's (

As part of his responsibilities, he also did development of short form programming for the diverse Discovery networks and new media platforms.


Since leaving Discovery, Mr. Panzner has dedicated his time to the development of a new audiovisual industry he has invented.  Re:Naissance  is a revolutionary new concept in animation, conceived as a means of transforming aging catalog and archives into salable, low-cost, high quality audiovisual products. For the first time ever in the 100-year history of animation, Re:Naissance is going to invert the adaptation process by taking existing live-action films and faithfully reproducing them in animation, in a totally original graphic style unique to every film. As astonishing as it might sound, this has never been done. The first Re:Naissance film is 
George Romero's 1968 cult horror classic 

Night of the Living Dead
.


Mr. Panzner was recently named Chief Operating Officer of Munich-based live-action/animation production company Avalon Entertainment.

Disabled Living Foundation (DLF) is a 
non-profit organisation based in the 











United Kingdom










 that provides advice on 
disability issues for older and 
disabled people. The organisation maintains one of the UK's disability product 
databases.  

The DLF runs a national 
helpline, and has published a paper based directory of daily living products, known as the Hamilton Directory,  for many years. In recent years it has started to publish product information online but only on a subscription basis. CEO, Nicole Penn-Symons, stated in the 2004/05 annual report that it is an organisational objective to make the product database free to the public.1


In 2005 DLF partnered with the 

GUS (retailer)
 Charitable Trust to pilot a new business model to make the DLF's information free to the public.  This  service has the working name 'Bathing made easy'2



SARA


SARA is an expert system designed to allow the general public to obtain disability advice independently.3 It was designed in conjunction with Occupational Therapists. It was an experimental pilot development in partmentship with the UK's Department of Health4 as part of the Integrating Community Equipment Services (ICES)5 healthcare programme.

Chaukhandi Stupa



Chaukhandi Stupa is an important 
Buddhist 
stupa  in 

Sarnath
, located 13 kilometres from 











Varanasi










, 

Uttar Pradesh
, 

India
. Stupas are descendents of burial mounds and  serve as a shrine for a relic of the 


Buddha

.1 


History


The Chaukhandi Stupa is thought originally to have been built as a terraced temple during the 
Gupta period between the  4th to 6th Century to mark the site where 
Lord Buddha and his first disciples met traveling from 

Bodh Gaya
 to 

Sarnath
. Later 

Govardhan
, the son of a 
Raja, modified the stupa to its present shape by building  the octagonal tower to commemorate the visit of 










Humayun









, the powerful 







Mughal






 ruler.2 


Today the stupa is a high earthen mound covered with a brickwork edifice topped by an octagonal tower. It is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.

Aris Thessaloniki Football Club is a 

Greek
 
football club that premiered on the 25th of March 1914 in 
















Thessaloniki















. The colors of the team are yellow and black, reminiscent of 










Byzantium









, where 
















Thessaloniki















 has always been the second most important city of the Empire. Aris has earned 3 league titles and 1 cup in football and is considered as one the five greatest clubs in 

Greece
 and the biggest in 




Macedonia



. The club is named after 
Ares, the god of war, whose image is portrayed on the club logo (as depicted in the 


Ludovisi Ares

), always on guard to fight if necessary. 



History



The beginning



The club was established by a group of 12 young friends in a coffee bar in 
















Thessaloniki















 on 25th of March 1914 and given the name Aris from the 
god of war, aply nicknamed due to the recent 
Balkan War and the fact that in Greek mythology, Aris was a deity who was in conflict with Hercules, the mythological character after which Aris's rival football team, Iraklis, was named. In the beginning the club was based near the 
Arch and Tomb of Galerius but after the accession of two minor football clubs in 1919 and 1921 the club's base was moved near to Flemming Street. The first stadium was built where today lies Mars Field Park in Stratou Avenue. Quickly the club became very popular and soon new sections apart from football were established. The 

Basketball department
 was formed in 1922. In 1928 it was the first team which won the first Greek league. 




A golden era



The leading star of Thessaloniki and untamed in the rest of Greece, Aris shone in all athletic activities just after the end of World War I. In water sports, in basketball and in track and field Aris was synonymous to being first, to being the Champion. The local championships he won were countless. Beginning in 1923, when he won his first title, until 1959, when local tournaments ceased, the club rarely finished second or third.


Only 13 years since his foundation when the golden era of his long history came. This was during 1927-28: he won the first official Championship of Greece. It was unfortunate that due to disagreements with the organizing body (EPO, which subsequently wrote them off) 
Olympiakos, 


Panathinaikos

 and 
AEK did not take part in this championship. Instead they founded what became known as CFA (Center Football Association), an institution that the teams from Salonika and rural Greece paid for dearly. Three teams participated in the first official Greek championship: Aris, Atromitos from Athens and Ethnikos from Piraeus. Aris won both matches against Atromitos [1-3 in Athens on 24.5.1928 and again in Thessaloniki on Iraklis  stadium on the 17.6.1928]. He won against Ethnikos at home with the same score and lost against him away 3-2 in Piraeus, in a stadium known as the Cycling Ring. Amassing 6 points and starring footballers Katranzos, Papas, Lontaridis, Zare, Aggelakis, Ioannidis, Katsaounis, K. Vikelidis, Yiakoumis, Nakopoulos and Oplopios, ARIS was crowned Champion, the first Champion in Greek football history. This success send convulsions of joy and awe across his many supporters in Thessaloniki and other towns and villages and affirmed Aris as a major football club in the conscience of sports fans across the nation.


During 1931-32 the club shone brighter then ever before, and no one could doubt his greatness or power. It is during this period that Aris became, for the first time, truly dominant in the football circuit of Greece. He became Champion of Greece for the second time and thus begun the period of his reign. This second pan-Hellenic Championship included the teams of CFA (Olympiakos, Panathinaikos and AEK), but they are no matches for the  God of War . He managed to amass 22 points: 9 victories in 14 matches, 4 draws and only one loss. He sat on the Champions  throne leaving Panathinaikos to the second place.




Victories and Trophies




 
Before World War II and with an incentive taken by the notable Aris  executive and member of the BOD of the International Fair of Thessaloniki Mr. Athinodoros Anastasiadis the International Exhibitions Cup was founded. Aris participated and rose to prominence in this Cup, both before and after World War II. We shall elsewhere go into more detail as regards ARIS  successes in this and the UEFA Cup.


But let us review the international matches of the team. ARIS was the first Greek club to invite a team from abroad to play a friendly. Sporting Cub Serbia traveled to Thessaloniki on the 20th of January 1923 and was beaten by ARIS 3-1. The second team that was invited to Thessaloniki was Perister from Monastiri and following this Aris began his own trips abroad, to other countries in the Balkan region and the Middle East. Before we move on to comment on the other matches ARIS has played against teams from abroad we must, for historic reasons, point out that the first match Aris played against PAOK was during the period 1925-6 and the  yellows  won 5-2. PAOK became ARIS  biggest opponent and from thereon until now the clashes between these two popular and historic teams are considered a unique event for the city and its sports fans.


But the most talked about victory of Aris abroad was at Sofia, against Bulgarian Champion Lefsky with score 2-4. In the aftermath of this Aris toured other countries in the Balkan region, while during 1934-35 he undertook an extensive and successful tour of Turkey, Lebanon and Israel. Two ace players from Iraklis, Tsaganias and Margaropoulos joined the team for this tour. In Turkey, Aris managed a draw against Fener Bax (2-2) while at Beirut he beat the National Team of Lebanon and in Israel manages to obtain positive results, winning international recognition.


All of these with regard to the period prior to WW II. With regard to a period that gave birth to the big stars that shone in the stadiums of that era. The Vikelidis brothers, like the Andrianopoulos brothers in Olympiakos, are names often remembered. The patriarch of the family, Kostas, the unsurpassed in technique midfielder Nikoforos, the  Human Tornado  as Kleanthis used to be known, and leaving for last, but certainly not least, the  Macedonian Armored Vehicle , the youngest of the family, Kitsos, also known as the  Terrorist  of opponent goalkeepers and by many other nicknames that were given to him by the press. Let us not forget Aggelakis, whose football shoe was carried around by his admirers, Kaltekis, Papas, the Koloniari brothers, Katrantzos, Danelian, Koublis and so many others, most of who sent their spirits to guard present day ARIS.


But there came a day when all these giants of football that made ARIS such a great team stopped playing. New stars were born and a new era begun for the team. The footballers that composed the greatest team, ARIS, the Greek National Team and Thessaloniki s own intra-club team resigned and only few were left to help the youngsters who undertook the difficult task of leading the team to yet another triumphant period. Gotsis, Abrachamian, Magras, Sidiropoulos, Stavrakbeis, Siotis, Nikolaidis, Koloniaris and Chatzinikolaou together with the human steam-roller, Kleanthis Vikelidis, would complete the prior to WW II period of the team, as the clouds of war slowly gathered above Greece and Europe. When Greece was under German occupation all athletic activities came to a stop and only on rare occasions could ARIS amass a team to face teams composed of German soldiers. The Greek spirit characterized these matches and in most cases the Greeks, who were also playing against the referee and his favorable treatment of the Germans, beat the German squads. Regarding the referees of the era, we must mention Kostas Gikopoulos, whose fear for his own life forced him to favor overwhelmingly the Germans. But Kostas Gikopoulos committed one further, and most important, villainous deed against ARIS in 1956, when the  yellows  played against the National Team of Hungary in Charilaou. The  yellows  forced their opponents to a draw (3-3), although they were ahead for most of the match. Then, just before the final whistle and from a set position, the Magyars, playing without their big star Pouskas, brought the ball in ARIS  quarters and managed an equalizer, exploiting the    tolerance  of the referee.




The Third Title



In the first national championship after the war (1946) three teams competed for the title: Thessaloniki Champion Aris, Athens Champion 
AEK and Piraeus Champion 
Olympiakos. It was another moment of glory for the Thessalonikians who were proclaimed national Champions for the third time. They beat Olympiakos twice, scoring two goals and conceding none, they came to a draw with AEK in Athens and ripped it to shreds in PAOK s stadium in Thessaloniki (score 4-1). A lot of people still remember this, the last of the championship titles of the team, and the frenzied celebrations it generated amongst the people of Thessaloniki. Local newspapers  MACEDONIA ,  THE LIGHT ,  PEOPLE S VOICE  as well as the Athenian papers wrote triumphant headlines to mark the  yellow s  major success, a success that was underlined by the titan efforts of Vikelidis, Tsonas, Magras, Abrachamian, Siotis, Nikolaidis, Kaftatzis, Kaftatzis II, Liakopoulos, Vasiliadis, Velliadis and Koloniaris. These semi-gods led the god of war to the Champion s throne for the third time.




In the Heydays...



A lot of local championships took place up until 1949, when Aris won the title of the Champion of Thessaloniki again and took place in the national championship. An expedition with precedent took place and 2.000 of ARIS  supporters traveled to Athens by ship. They boarded  TETI  which looked like a yellow carrier. Mr. Nick Kabanis organized the tour. He later undertook a formal, great and historic role in the executive branch of the team. 


In the first match Aris played against 


Panathinaikos

, who was rescued from contrition by referee Zapardas, who force the  yellows  to an unjust draw (1-1). Aris was also  slaughtered  at Karaiskaki stadium and, therefore, deprived of the title. He was also beaten by 
AEK in the 












Greek League Cup











 final in 1950, a title that eluded him for several years. Luck smiled to Aris, finally, in 1970 at Kaftantzoglio, when he beat PAOK and, thus, came the happy end to a flirt with the League Cup that lasted for 38 years.


That magical evening the goal by Manolis Keramidas broke an almost forty year old tradition and on that magical evening the  yellows  sang as in one voice:  They come back to me, the golden years, one by one .





Recent Years

  


 
Titles have eluded Aris in recent years, and Aris was even demoted to the Second Division twice, due to bad management. Aris has always immediately returned to the National 1st Division, however, and throughout the years the club has managed to play European football by qualifying for the UEFA Cup tournament on several occasions. Aris managed to end 4rth at the last two 

Superleague
 seasons and participated three times in the last five 












Greek Cup











 finals.  In 2008, Aris had a successful year at the UEFA Cup competition, qualifying over 


Real Zaragoza

 and eliminated in 
group stages playing against 

Bayern Munich
, 


Sporting Braga

, 


Bolton Wanderers

 and 


Red Star Belgrade

. The  yellows  fans also take pride in the fact that Aris was the main domestic club of Greece's 
Euro 2004 goal scoring hero 








Angelos Charisteas







.  


In December, 2006 the club's board decided to create an organisation called 
Aris Members Club, (               ), in order to give Aris supporters the opportunity to participate in the club's management by buying no par value shares. According to the plan each member will have the right to vote in the board elections for president as well as to run as candidate. In order to be involved in the elections fans must also financially support the club.




Supporters


Aris has a relatively big fanbase for Greek standards and it is the fifth most supported club in Greece. The fanbase is spread across all the economic classes in the city and the greater region of 
Macedonia. The biggest rivalry is against the 
arch-rival PAOK . Another traditional rival is of course the Athenian clubs 
Olympiacos Piraeus, 


Panathinaikos

 and 
AEK Athens. 
Its supporters are organised in many fan clubs, the most important of them being Super 3 and Ierolohites.




Crest and Colours


The emblem of the team is a resting 
Ares (Greek:      - Aris), the 
Olympian 
god of 
war, as depicted in the 


Ludovisi Ares

. The colors of the team are yellow and black, reminiscent of the 

Byzantine Empire
, under which 
















Thessaloniki















 was always the second most important city.

Cities, towns and villages in Morelos






This article is about Hueyapan, Morelos. For Other towns by the name of Hueyapan see 
Hueyapan (Disambiguation)




 The Main plaza of Hueyapan looking north from the municipal palace.



Santo Domingo Hueyapan is a small town in the rural northeastern part of the 








Mexican







 





state




 of 

Morelos
, which belongs to the municipality of 
Tetela del Volcan. It lies at an elevation of ca 2000-2500 metres above sea level on the southern slopes of the active volcano 
Popocatepetl. To the west of Hueyapan runs the 
Amatzinac river, to the north is the Popocatepetl-Iztaccihuatl natural reserve, and to the south the town of 








Tlacotepec







 and to the east is the 
municipality of Tochimilco which belongs to the state of 

Puebla
.


Ethnography


The inhabitants of Hueyapan are of 
Nahua ethnicity and the 
Nahuatl language is spoken by most adults. The name of the town comes from the Nahuatl language and means  on the great water  referring to the abundant water resources of the locality. The people of Hueyapan mostly practice subsistence agriculture: They produce maize, beans, squash, peach, avocado and plums. The people of Hueyapan are also known for their woolen products such as 
ponchos (gaban in the local Spanish), 
shawls  (rebozo) and skirts (chincuete) of thick woolen cloth. The thread is made on traditional spindles called malacates, dyed with natural dyes (such as 
Anil, 
Walnut husks, 




St John's wort



)and the fabric is woven on 
backstrap looms.
Cultural aspects of Hueyapan and particularly the ethnic identity of the Nahuas of Hueyapan have been described in the book Being Indian in Hueyapan by 








American







 
anthropologist Judith Friedlander. The 
Nahuatl dialect of Hueyapan has been the object of a few small studies. Karen Dakin and Diana Ryesky have done an ethnolinguistic and dialectal survey of Nahuatl in Morelos, and they describe the dialect of Hueyapan as a typical central dialect with some traits particular of the Morelos varieties. In 
1949 Miguel Barrios Espinosa, a teacher from Hueyapan, published a collection of folktales from Hueyapan in the nahuatl language in the journal Tlalocan. An article by Patrick Johansson (1989) deals with the grammatical encoding of honorifics in the Nahuatl language. Currently SIL linguists are working on Morelos Nahuatl, collaborating with speakers from Hueyapan and from 
Cuentepec.

History


According to 
Duran, Hueyapan was founded by people from 

Xochimilco
 around 902 CE, conquered by the 
Aztecs under 

Moctezuma II
 and shortly thereafter 










conquered by a Spanish force









 led by female 
Conquistador 
Maria Estrada in 
1524.


Between 
1563 and 
1573 the 
Dominican order constructed a convent dedicated to 

Santo Domingo
 in Hueyapan. The Convent is now an ex-convent functioning as the town's Catholic church. Fray 
Diego Duran stayed here for a while and is thought to have compiled much of the information for his Cronica here.


In colonial times Hueyapan was part of the 
encomienda originally given to the Estrada family, but was later laid directly under the Spanish throne. Until recently, access to Hueyapan from other communities was limited, but in the past twenty years infrastructure has made transport to and from Hueyapan much easier.


In the 1970s and 1980s 
marijuana was produced in and around Hueyapan and the town received negative attention from the Mexican media.  Government forces occupied the town for brief periods and arrested many citizens both rightfully and wrongfully.

2000 general election, in which Mario Soberanes (of the

1062 deaths
Occitan people
Counts of Provence




Geoffrey I or Josfred1 (died February between 1061 and 1063) was the joint 
Count of Provence with his elder brothers 

William IV
 and 

Fulk
 from 1018 to his death. He was the third son of 

William III of Provence
 and 
Gerberga of Macon and a scion of the younger line of the family. It is possible that he did not carry the title  count  until after the death of his eldest brother William around 1032. 

He became 
Count of Arles in 1032 and he and Fulk made a donation to the 
Abbey of Cluny on 
26 May 
1037. During his brother's life, he was secondary to him. With the death of his brother, he became sole count with the title marchyo sive comes Provincie. The title of marchio (
margrave) implied that he was the head of the dynasty. 


He was a great builder of the church in his region, devastated in the previous century by 


Saracen

 raids. He restored the abbey of 
Sparro, which they had destroyed, and gave it to the archiepiscopal see of 





Aix




.  Following the example of most of his ancestors, he was a patron of 
Saint Victor in 
Marseille. In 1045, he consented to a donation of one of his vicecomital vassals to the monastery and in March 1048 to the transferral of property from 
Raimbaud, Archbishop of Arles, to the church. On 
1 July 
1055 and again in 1057, with his wife Stephanie and his son 

Bertrand
, he himself donated property to St Victor. His patronage far exceeded his predecessors however. He relinquished his rights over any lands the viscount of Marseilles, Fulk, wished to donate to the monastery in 1044, while in 1032 he had consented to turn over lands to the church as 
allods. In 1038, he gave over comital rights which had been possessed of his house since the reign of his great-grandfather 

William the Liberator
 to his vassals, losing control over many castles and fortresses. The royal 
fisc, which had been under control of the counts of Provence since the time of William, was mostly parcelled out as allods to the vassals during Geoffrey's tenure and the weakening of the county of Provence as a united polity can be dated from his reign. Even when 
Rudolf III of Burgundy, his lord, sold any remaining rights over some royal villae, Geoffrey gave these away as allodial holdings. 


Geoffrey was succeeded by his son 

Bertrand
. One daughter became the first wife of 



Raymond IV of Toulouse


, another, Stephanie, married 
William II of Besalu and the third was 

Gerberga
, married 
Gilbert I of Gevaudan. 



Notes





Also spelled Jauffred, Jozfred, Gosfred, or Gausfred.

Boccadasse.




Boccadasse (Boccadaze in 

Genoese
) is an old mariner's neighbourhood of the 



Italian


 city of 


Genoa

. It lies at the eastern side of the Corso Italia stroll, the  main sea front stroll of the city of Genoa, at the feet of Via Aurora a typical ligurian narrow street ( creuza ).


The origin of the name is uncertain, one of the more reliable hypothesis is that the name comes from the form of the bay on which Boccadasse lies, thus the name should be the shortening of the genoese for donkey's mouth boca d'aze. Another theory is that the name derives from the torrent who used to flow through the village the asse, therefore the  name should mean outlet of the asse. 


The village of Boccadasse attracts tourists. It is enclosed in a narrow bay, at the eastern side the cape of 
Santa Chiara with a castle (a new building in the style of a medieval castle), on the western side the rocks, and in the middle the tiny cobblestones beach where the seamen's small boats rest.

Private

USA











Manchester






The New Hampshire Institute of Art is a 
bachelor's degree-granting 
college that provides an undergraduate education in the 
fine arts, complemented by majors in the professional 
arts. It is the first and only independent college of art in the state of 





New Hampshire




. Located in the heart of 

Manchester, New Hampshire
's Victory Park National Historic District, the Institute offers a 
Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with concentrations in 
Ceramics, 
Illustration, 
Painting, 
Photography, Interdisciplinary Arts, and Art Education. The NHIA has a collaborative agreement with the 


University of New Hampshire at Manchester

 that allows students interested in pursuing a degree in Fine Art to transfer into the Institute's BFA program. The Institute also offers Certificate programs in Painting, Ceramics, 
Interior Design and Photography through its Continuing Education program. The NHIA serves as an important cultural center for the city of Manchester and the state of New Hampshire. The NHIA is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).



History


The college was established in 1898 as the Manchester Institute of Arts and Sciences, and its original goal was to cultivate an appreciation of the arts through progressive educational instruction. In 1924, the State Board of Education certified the Institute s four-year program to prepare high school graduate to teach art. Shortly thereafter, a four-year program in Fine Arts was approved. The Institute changed its name to the New Hampshire Institute of Art in 1997, which was the same year the New Hampshire Postsecondary Commission authorized the Institute to award the 
Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.




Campus


The NHIA is located in the Victory Park National Historic District of 

Manchester, New Hampshire
. The campus consists of four academic buildings and three dormitories, all within a three-block radius of the Victory Park quadrangle, with the exception of upperclassman housing at Harrison House. 


The most recent addition to the campus is a classroom and studio building housed in a former paint shop on Amherst Street. The building was originally home to the PSNH meter department. In addition to classroom space, the facility is also home to a public art supply store and gallery on the first floor. The building was purchased by the Institute in 2005, renovated by local architect Dennis Mires, P.A., and won an honor award for 
adaptive reuse by the New Hampshire chapter of the 

American Institute of Architects
.

 (sister of the playwright 






Tom Robertson





).  These plays, influenced by the fairy work of 
James Planche, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.4  The first was the fantasy 




The Palace of Truth



 in 1870.  
Pygmalion and Galatea, a satire of sentimental, romantic attitudes toward myth, was produced in 1871.  Together, these plays, and successors such as 




The Wicked World



 (1873), 




Sweethearts



 (1874), 




Charity



 and Broken Hearts, did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the 


German Reed Entertainment

s had done for him on the musical stage, establishing that his capabilities extended far beyond 
burlesque.  They won him artistic credentials as a writer of wide range, who was as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour.


Broken Hearts is one of several Gilbert plays, including The Wicked World, 






Princess Ida





, 






Fallen Fairies





, and 






Iolanthe





, where the introduction of males into a tranquil world of women brings  mortal love  that wreaks havoc with the peaceful status quo.  The play examines both human frailties: vanity, misplaced trust, judging by appearance; and human virtues: pity, love, and sacrifice.  Some of the play's themes and plot devices resurface in 
Gilbert and Sullivan's 






The Yeomen of the Guard





 and 






Princess Ida





.5  Here, as in many of Gilbert's plays, we feel Gilbert's distrust of  heroes  in Florian's casual arrogance and cruelty, but we also see the character's real chivalry.6


Gilbert wrote Broken Hearts for his friend, 






John Hare





 of the Court Theatre.  He worked on the play for much of 1875 and said that he had  invested a great part of himself  in the work.7  Hare generally directed the plays that he starred in, and Gilbert preferred to direct the plays that he wrote.  Therefore, the two men, both quick-tempered, clashed at rehearsals of Broken Hearts.7  Gilbert sent an advance copy of the script to his old friend, the critic 









Clement Scott








, who was then the editor of The Theatre.  Scott indicated that he was pleased with the play.  Gilbert wrote to Scott,  I am delighted to think that you like the piece so much. I have been so often told that I am devoid of a mysterious quality called 'sympathy' that I determined in this piece to do my best to show that I could pump it up if necessary. 8   Later, however, Scott quoted a joke by 
F. C. Burnand about going to see  Broken Parts .  Gilbert was hurt and called Scott's remark  Most offensive, and likely to cause a great deal of injury to my play. 9


The play was generally well reviewed, although it did not catch on with audiences and was not a financial success, but it remained one of Gilbert's two favourites among all the plays he had written (the other was Gretchen, an adaptation of the 





Faust




 legend).  Later, Gilbert had a line from the play engraved on the sun-dial at his home, 




Grim's Dyke



:  even Time is hastening to its end. 10  


At the time Broken Hearts was written, 
Gilbert and Sullivan had already produced their hit one-act 
comic opera 






Trial by Jury





 as well as their 
burlesque, 






Thespis





, and their producer 
Richard D'Oyly Carte was seeking funding to bring them together again. But funding was slow in coming, and both Gilbert and 







Arthur Sullivan






 were still producing a considerable amount of work separately: Gilbert produced two other plays that year, for instance. However, four years after Broken Hearts, 






H.M.S. Pinafore





 would become such a runaway hit that Gilbert would only produce five theatrical works away from Sullivan in the eleven years following.




Synopsis


Act I


On a tropical island in the 
14th century, a group of noblewomen have fled the world, their hearts having been broken through the loss of their lovers.  They vow to love no living thing, but they have transferred their loves to inanimate objects: Lady Vavir loves a sundial (a symbol of mortality), and her sister, Lady Hilda, loves a fountain (a symbol of vitality), and Melusine loves a hand mirror.  Lady Vavir is a delicate girl and fears that she hasn't much longer to live.  The only male allowed on the island is their servant Mousta,  a deformed ill-favoured dwarf, hump-backed and one-eyed  and therefore no threat to their maidenhood.  Mousta is trying to practice magic from a book he has found, hoping to make himself handsome, for he desires to love and be loved.  


Prince Florian arrives on the island.  He has a magic veil of invisibility, and Mousta schemes to get it, as he hopes that it would help him woo a woman.  Vavir comes to bid good-night to her sundial.  Florian listens, concealed by the veil.  Vavir concludes by wishing that the fountain had the power of speech to speak its love. Florian, amused by the situation, answers for it, much to Vavir's amazement and joy.  He weaves a tale of being a man enchanted into the sundial, who will be released if a maiden would love it truly for a year and a day. He also gives voice to Melusine's hand mirror. As the ladies exit, he is greatly amused at the effect his joke has on them. 


Hilda has come to bid her fountain good-night, and Florian is overwhelmed by her beauty in the moonlight.  She tells it of the love she had lost: a certain Prince Florian, but how it (so far as it could) has taken his place in her heart. Florian then speaks through the fountain, telling her he loves her, but wondering what she would do if this Prince Florian should be alive after all. She tell him (as the fountain) that it would be an unbearable, but impossible joy: he (the fountain) should be content for she has pledged herself to him forever. But neither of them realize that Mousta has overheard this vow. 


Act II


Mousta has been able to steal the veil of invisibility. Now, without the veil, Vavir finds Florian. She recognizes his voice as that of the sundial, and believing him to be its disenchanted spirit, pours out her love for him, much to Florian's dismay.  Not knowing how to tell her he doesn't love her, and recognizing that the blow would kill her, he sends her away with a promise to return presently. 


Lady Hilda has come to tell her fountain about Vavir's now-incarnate lover, and begs it, if it can, to take human form.  Mousta, now with the veil, answers for the fountain, telling her that he can take such form, but fears if he does, she will despise him. He is roughly-hewn, ugly: much like their wretched serving-man. Hilda reassures the  spirit of the fountain  that she has loved him for his generous spirit, not his appearance.  The  fountain  presses her for a token. She casts her ring in the pool, pledging to be his bride. Mousta takes the ring and reveals himself. Hilda is stunned with horror and amazement.  Mousta confesses a genuine love for her goodness and generosity. She wheedles from him the veil of invisibility.  Putting it on, she violently scorns him: she will keep her promise to be his bride, but he will never see her again. Wrapped in the veil, she exits, to Mousta's eloquent despair. 


Florian returns, looking for Hilda. In response to his harsh questioning, Mousta tells him that she is missing; she must have his stolen veil. Hilda returns, unseen, and is amazed to see Florian arguing with Mousta. After his departure, she prepares to reveal herself to Florian, but is stopped by Vavir's arrival. Love has given her new strength and new hope; and only makes Florian's duty harder to perform. He tells her a story of a knight who met a gentle young girl. As a thoughtless joke, he spoke words of love to her, not realizing she would believe them. Vavir gradually realizes he is speaking of her; and Hilda learns that Florian loves her. As he finishes, Vavir recites the end of his story: the girl pardoned him and died. As Hilda prays for her sister's strength, Florian pleads with her that the girl must live, but Vavir collapses in his arms. 


Act III


About a half-hour before sunset, Melusine and Amanthis watch as Vavir sleeps at the foot of the sundial. The others have left to look for the missing Hilda and Florian.  Vavir confesses that she fears to die without seeing Hilda again.  Hilda reveals herself, and Vavir tells her how much Florian loves her, apologizing for having loved him. Hilda tells Vavir that the prince had been sent to the island to save her life with his love. If Hilda disappears, she reasons, he would soon forget her.  


Upon Florian's return, Vavir reveals that Hilda loves him and is nearby. Florian realizes that Hilda has the missing veil. Mousta tells Florian the truth and that Mousta received the token of her pledge to be his wife.  He mocks Florian's misery at losing her   at their both losing her. Florian flies at Mousta in a fit of jealousy, prepared to wreak fatal vengeance on him. Mousta doesn't protest; he wants to die but asks Florian if the two of them were evenly matched rivals.  Florian's wrath dies, and he releases Mousta, apologizing for his harshness.  Mousta is stunned by his mercy, and gives him Hilda's ring before exiting. 


In hopes that she will hear him, Florian announces he has her pledge and that she has nothing to fear. Hilda does reveal herself and begs him to save Vavir's life with his love.  No man can so direct his heart, but Florian agrees to try.  However, it is too late.  Vavir returns, supported by the other two ladies. Hilda pleads with Vavir, and Death itself, for her life. But Vavir is prepared to die.

 Union Organisation


The University of Bradford Union (UBU) is run by an executive of six full-time 
sabbatical officers,1 elected annually and the end of the academic season, and up to six part-time executive officers elected at the start of the academic season. The executive committee is unusual in not having a 





president




: the post was abolished by Shumon Rahman in 2001 who was elected the Union's first Asian President in 2000. The new executive positions and the reforms he introduced were modified in 2007 to incorporate an agreement with the University made in 2004 that a full review of the officers would take place. This involved merging the Treasurer and Secretary (what was Internal Affairs) role and the creation of one of the only Ethics, Environment and Welfare Officers in the country. 


The executive is monitored by a council of up to 40 elected students who meet around 6 times each academic year: 10 of these places are filled through open places in a cross campus ballot, the others are made up of Course Representatives, Athletics, Societies  and other bodies representatives in the Union such as Forums (statutory meetings of union members).


The Union is located in the Communal Building on campus, and is politically active (nominally to the 
left) a new building is planned to be developed over the next few years with 4.5 million being granted to the Union building development by the University Council in 2008. 2




Role


The Role of the Union is to support and provide services for its students of the university (whether members or not) such as academic or financial advice,3 or activities and entertainment or for their safety.4



Student activities


The largest student involvement in their Union comes in the forms of the sports clubs through the 




Athletics Association



 (commonly known as the AA)5 and societies6. There is a variety of both. Even though the University did not till recently run any performing arts courses, there are several societies for music and theatre. The variety of sports available is largely due to the centralised funding and membership structure of the AA, which helps support smaller clubs. The current student union colours are blue and red, but many of the sports teams still use their traditional black, with red and white accents.


The Student Union also has 
RamAir, one of the UK's longest running student radio stations, broadcasting on 1350
AM and online, a student newspaper called 
The Bradford Student and a film society/cinema showing professional 
35mm cinema prints known as the 
Bradford Student Cinema.




Campaigns


UBU claims to be a very political union7. It runs campaigns on varying issues.


Palestine and Khaled al-Mudallal
In 2007 a Bradford Student Khaled al-Mudallal became trapped in Palestine. The union ran a campaign to support Khaled8 and to aid his return. It was supported by 
UCU, the Lectures Union and the 
NUS the National Students' Union. He was elected the Honorary Vice President9 of the 

LSE Students' Union
 and released on the 4th December 10


Blood Donation
UBU has supported the right for gay men to give blood with its 
LGBT society campaigning throughout the year of 2006 and 2007 to lift the ban.11. The union supported the society12 in encouraging people who can to give blood and to call for the ban to be lifted in favour of a ban on promiscuity and people who partake in unsafe sex giving blood.


Imran Khan
The union took a stance with the 
Bradford University in supporting 
Imran Khan13, the University chancellor and Pakistani 
MP when he was arrested in 200714. They co-organised events for the release of Imran and a demonstration was due to take place, organised by the Union on the 24th November 2007


Fair Trade
UBU coordinates the 
Bradford University Fair Trade Status15, in 2006 the Union gained Fair Trade status for the University and continues to campaign on this issue.


Lap Dancing club
In 2002 the union campaigned against the opening of a lap dancing club near to the university.16




 Entertainments and Venues



The Union at present runs four bars, with the Biko Bar (named after 

Steve Biko
) permanently closed in 2005 and the Theatre in the Mill Bar shut for redevelopment with no completion date in 2006, all the other bars are now located in the Communal Building. 




The main bar is called the  Courtyard  which is open every day of the week. It has a Sunday night quiz and also hosts the Junior Common Room, although this term is now not widely used. The other bars are all club venues of which there are three, from the smallest  Escape  which is open most nights for a variety of music to the two larger venues called  Colours  and  Basement . All these three club venues combine to form the Friday Night Disco (FND) which was renamed 






Flirt!





 in 2007 to come inline with the 
NUSSL Branding. 


The Clubs are host to irregular live music and bands and to the UK 





Infest




. 





Infest




 is an annual 
music festival held in over the August 
bank holiday weekend, featuring a range of 
alternative electronic music acts.17 It originated with in early 1998 through the efforts of three 
students and the students' union Entertainments Manager as a one day event and has since grown to the current three day weekend.






RamAir




RamAir is a 
radio station run by Students Union at the 

University of Bradford
, 

England
.18 It broadcasts locally on 1350AM and also online through its 
web site. The name comes from the old students union log of a Ram's head. It is one of three media groups at the union (the others being the film society  
Bradford Student Cinema  and the student magazine  Bradford Student News  (formally Kinetic, Scrapie and Javelin)) who, historically are not considered part of the  sports clubs  or the  clubs and societies . In many respects they are run as a normal society with membership, however as they provide a service accessible to all students and staff (not just the societies members), they are treated differently and come under the jurisdiction of the Communications Officer.



 History 


It was founded in 198019 and operates from two studios in the university's student union building. The station is run entirely by student volunteers, who as well as presenting shows also handle the technical aspects. Up until the mid 1990s, RamAir broadcast to students via a series of induction loops ran throughout the student halls, however this never proved reliable. In conjunction with SBN, RamAir had an LPAM (Low Power AM) Radica transmitter, affectionately known as  Doris , installed in the car park of the former Shearbridge Halls, which broadcast on 1350AM at a max power of 1 watt.
A RamAir show  The Buzz  was 
syndicated on the Student broadcast network from 1998 to 1999. 20 RamAir is also available via the Internet on an .mp3 stream, allowing students to listen to the station through the university Internet service, as well as in places in the union building such as the union shop and the laundrette.




 Programing 


Most shows are presented in the evening or at weekends, when students are free, so during the daytime music is played from a computer. Previously the station syndicated the 





Student Broadcast Network




 (SBN) when no shows were being broadcast - this was changed in 2004 when SBN went bust.


Its flagship show is 'Wednesday Night Sessions' which broadcasts local music and acoustic sessions by local Bradford bands. It also has a range of shows covering many music genres as well as a show discussing the latest news.


RamAir annually broadcasts the 'Questions to Candidates' (Hustings) for the student union elections of sabbatical officers and NUS conference delegates. It also has a big presence at many union events such as freshers' week, the May carnival and the end of year event.


Out of university term time the station broadcasts non stop music, also used to fill in other free air time from the station's computer playout system - a bank of computers running software written by one of the station's engineers. The station was re-launched just before 2006 'Welcome Week' (new intake of student) with various new shows   returns of others from the previous year.


News is played hourly via the IRN news service.




 Achievements 



It was the first student radio station to broadcast legally on 
FM.2122


As of September 2007, it was the first student radio station to be specifically made available through the respective 

Wii
 and 

PlayStation 3
 browsers.


When analogue cable television was commonplace, the station was broadcast on 98FM across the region to listeners with a cable feed (No subscription required). RamAir occasionally broadcasts across the city of Bradford on an FM RSL (Restricted Service Licence), usually on 102FM from a transmitter located on top of the university's JB Priestley library. The station often hires out its FM broadcast kit to other student stations for their own RSLs.


On 
April 26 
2006, 


Phill Jupitus

 broadcast his 

BBC 6 Music
 breakfast show from the station, and interviewed 


Billy Bragg

 who had played a concert at the university the previous evening.


Its most famous former DJ is 
Lucio Buffone, who has since won a 
Sony Award and now presents a show on 
Capital Radio.


As of 
26 May 
2008, RamAir has released a charity single for download, entitled 'Scream Out!'. Half of the proceeds will go to the running of the station and the other half will go to the 
RNID's 'Don't Lose the Music' campaign. The single was recorded in the studios in early May 2008, by 6 
Bradford University students.23


In July 2008 RamAir submitted awards applications to the 
Student Radio Association and also set in motion a review of RamAir strategy with the aim to make the station one of the key providers of live music in the local area.





The Bradford Student


The Bradford Student is the latest incarnation of the student newspaper at Bradford. The autonomous paper was originally called Javelin. It changed its name in the early 1980s to Shep. By the 1990s the paper had become a magazine and then later changed its name to Scrapie, a reference to the ram's head on the Union logo. The name was again changed in a dramatic and still controversial  de-ramming  of the Union in 2004 which saw the Union logo change to four 'dots' and the ram's Head removed from official publications. The Ram remains in the name of the student Radio station 







Ramair






 and also in many of the sports teams which still use the traditional Ram's head logo. 


In 2007 the periodical was brought wholly into the Union; having previously had an independent editorial team, and printed as a newspaper again for the first time in 20 years. The paper is now jointly edited by the sabbatical team, staff members and students.




Bradford Student Cinema



The Bradford Student Cinema is a film society operating as part of the University of Bradford Union, the University of Bradford's 
Students' Union. It is one of three media groups at the union (the others being the radio station 'Ramair' and 'The Bradford Student' newspaper (Formally Kinetic) who, historically are not considered part of the  sports clubs  or the  clubs and societies . In many respects they are run as a normal society with membership, however as they provide a service accessible to all students and staff (not just the societies members), they are treated differently and come under the jurisdiction of the Media   Communications Officer. 



Bradford Student Cinema's 35 mm projector






History


The Bradford Student Cinema (BSC) is one of the oldest societies within the student union and can trace it heritage back to early days of the university. Formerly the Film Society, the BSC originally screen 16 mm film from lecture theatres on N floor of the Richmond Building (Refurbished in 2000 removing the projection boxes in favour of additional seating). It later moved into the University's Great Hall, where it gained a portable 35 mm projection system allowing it to showa full range of films available to commercial cinemas. The Great Hall is still used today, on what is believed to be the largest student cinema screen in the country.24.



Reel tower in the projection box







 Hardware 


The 9 metre wide solid steel-framed screen, complete with motorised adjustable masking flies down from the roof onto the stage and fills the proscenium arch of the Great Hall, making good use of the curtains to give a traditional cinema feel to the venue, in an auditorium designed as a multipurpose staged hall with good acoustics. As the projection box is situated three floors up from ground level, the projector has a steep rake, and the screen is angled back when dropped to remove any keystoning. For this reason audience for film showings are generally only invited to sit in the balcony circle rather than the stalls, seating up to 337. In the late nineties the projector was replaced with a 1950s Westrex 2001 projector, a model still in common use around the country. In 2001 the student union funded a  8,500 upgrade of the projection facilities, and the cinema was fitted with a Dolby CP55 processor, new amps and speakers including a subwoofer to bring Dolby surround to the cinema for the first time25 (Stereo is not commonly used in cinemas, as a central audio channel is required to centralise dialogue for any audience sitting off-centre). A red laser sound reader was also installed to future proof the projector for the arrival of cyan sound tracks, and improve the quality of intermediate high magenta sound tracks. The lamphouse and rectifier was also upgraded to handle 3 kW lamps. Due to the cost, new surround speakers were not fitted, and have instead been formed using older speakers placed along the rear of the balcony.



The BSC's cinema screen in the Great Hall







 Modern times 


In recent times the BSC has run the 
British Federation of Film Societies Student Group Conference and various exclusive preview screenings of the latest movies in conjunction with the 
Daily Telegraph's Movie Mania Promotion (circa 2001).25 Like many professional cinemas it screens cinema trailers and adverts from 

Pearl   Dean
. Due to a drop in student numbers and the opening of a 16-screen multiplex in the centre of Bradford, the student cinema has suffered in the last four years. Ironically the size of the BSC has been part of its downfall - whilst smaller societies use video or DVD, the BSC's screen and throw distance (27 m) means it cannot handle anything smaller than professional 35 mm cinema films. The union has since stepped in and the BSC now shows a reduced number of showing throughout the academic year free of charge to staff and students.


In 2002 the BSC nominated 


Brian Blessed

 to receive an 
Honorary Degree (


Doctor of Letters

) from the university for his contribution to film, television and acting, which he received during the Electronic Imaging   Media Communication Department's graduation ceremony in July 2003.


Cinema-goers used to be able to buy drinks and snacks, including alcohol for cinema showings as the Biko Bar, in the Richmond building, but this was closed in 2005. The cinema's showings have been in hiatus since 2005 due to the building of the new  5.3 million atrium and front entrance designed to provide a vibrant multi-functional space and form the heart of the University (Opened in October 2006 to celebrate the university's 40th birthday). A return to regular screening has been delayed by a long-awaited refurbishment of the Great Hall from January 2008, which is due to be completed in May. Due to the difficulties in licencing, fitting building work around exams, graduation ceremonies and registration, it is likely that the BSC will finally reopen in September 2008.26

Hermit House, Herzliya, Israel.



Hermit House is a spectacular though unconventional example of 
vernacular architecture in a similar vein to the 














Watts Towers













. The earthen residence is situated off the edge of cliff near the 
Sidna Ali Mosque in 
Herzliya, 

Israel
. Its owner, designer, and creator, 
Nissim Cachlon, has been building the structure solely by hand since the late 1970s, tunneling deep into the cliff side and using natural sea materials. The structure includes dozens of chambers covered in elaborate tile mosaics comprised of recycled materials such as blue glass from broken 
Maccabee beer bottles, plates, and other debris washed ashore. Local city authorities have so far been unable to oust the code non-compliant resident. Rising sea levels, caused in part by the city's construction of a jetty, now pose a threat to Cachlon's work of several decades. Hermit House's exterior is publicly visible and requests for interior tours are occasionally honored by its owner.

Route 99 is a 
state highway in 

Connecticut
 running for 10.64 miles from 
Route 9 in 

Cromwell
, through the town of 

Rocky Hill
, ending in 

Wethersfield
 at the 
Hartford city line. The road continues into Hartford as a local road (Wethersfield Avenue).  It is a former alignment of Route 9 prior to its upgrade to a 
freeway.



Route description


Route 99 begins as the northbound Exit 18 ramp of 
Route 9 in Cromwell. At the end of the off ramp, the road continues north as Main Street. (Access from Main Street to the southbound on-ramp for Route 9 is designated as State Road 901). Main Street is a two-lane road that goes north through Cromwell up to Rocky Hill for about 5.6 miles. At the junction with Elm Street (
Route 160), the road becomes a four-lane road known as the 













Silas Deane












 Highway. The Silas Deane Highway continues through Rocky Hill up to the town of Wethersfield. It serves as the main thoroughfare of these two towns, also providing access to several shopping centers. Route 99 has interchanges with 

Interstate 91
 in Rocky Hill and the 





Wilbur Cross Highway




 (
Route 15) in Wethersfield. At the Hartford city line, Route 99 ends but the road continues into downtown Hartford as Wethersfield Avenue.1




Special designations


The entire length of Route 99 is also known as the 





George Washington




 Memorial Highway.1




History


The alignment of Route 99 was originally designated as part of 

New England Interstate Route 10
 in the 1920s. The Silas Deane Highway was built in 1930 and New England Route 10 was shifted slightly west to use the new highway. In the 
1932 state highway renumbering, the alignment was re-designated as 
Route 9. When Route 9 was upgraded to an expressway between  

I-91
 and 
I-95 in 1969, the old surface alignment became Route 99.2

Misfeasance in public office

Law of negligence
Civil law




Misfeasance in public office is a cause of action in the 
civil courts of 

England
 and 
Wales.  It is an action against the holder of a public office, alleging in essence that the office-holder has misused or abused his power.


 Grounds 


In most cases, the essentials to bring an action of misfeasance in public office are that the office-holder acted illegally, knew he was doing so, and knew or should reasonably have known that third parties would suffer loss as a result.




 BCCI 


As a civil law action, the use of misfeasance of public office has grown in recent years, the law having been clarified in the litigation involving the collapse of the 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International.




 Railtrack 


Its most recent high-profile use was in the largest class action ever brought in the English courts, when 49,500 private shareholders of Britain's national railway infrastructure company 

Railtrack
 sued the 

Secretary of State for Transport
 for damages, alleging that in October 2001 the then holder of that office - 










Stephen Byers









 MP - had acted unlawfully in planning to put their company into administration on the grounds that it was 
insolvent.  The legal action failed because - as an action involving 
reflective loss - the shareholders had to prove - in addition to the grounds specified above - malice on the part of Byers.  They did not have the evidence to do so.

John Frush Knox

1997










Oak Park, Illinois












John Frush Knox (1907   1997)1 served as secretary and law clerk to 

United States Supreme Court
 Justice 

James Clark McReynolds
 from 1936 to 1937. He is chiefly known for his memoir of that experience.


 Life 



 Early life 


Knox was born in 1907, in 








Oak Park, Illinois







.2 In high school, he began writing 
pen pal letters to celebrities. He began with 

Civil War
 veterans and proceeded to such luminaries of the day as 

Helen Keller
, 




William Howard Taft



, and 
Admiral Byrd. He established an on-going correspondence with members of the 
United States Supreme Court, including 

Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
, 


Benjamin N. Cardozo

, and 

Willis Van Devanter
. His most sustained correspondence was with Van Devanter, one of the conservative  
Four Horsemen  of the Supreme Court.3


Knox did undergraduate work at the 

University of Chicago
 (
Ph.B. 1930) and then studied law at 

Northwestern University School of Law
 (


J.D.

 1934) and the 

Harvard Law School
 (
LL.M. 1936).4 He was an indefatigable diarist, generating more than 750 pages of scrapbook, commentary and written recollection by the time he reached college. At one time, Knox claimed that he intended to surpass 


Samuel Pepys

 as a diarist.1




 The year in Washington 


After his graduation from Harvard, Knox sought employment with Van Devanter. Van Devanter recommended Knox to fellow justice 

James Clark McReynolds
, who suffered from high employee turnover (Knox soon found out why).3 Knox served as private 
secretary and 
law clerk to McReynolds during the Supreme Court's 
October 1936 term. Knox would later write a long memoir of that experience, A Year in the Life of a Supreme Court Clerk in 



Franklin D. Roosevelt


's 

Washington
, centered mostly on his relations with McReynolds and McReynolds's two black servants, but also containing observations on other members of the Supreme Court at that time, and the historical period in general.1 Such memoirs are unique; few other law clerks to Supreme Court justices have documented the experience, and Knox's memoir, though not the first published, represents the earliest such document.




 Subsequent career 


Knox s clerkship ended when McReynolds fired him for taking time off to sit for the Washington, D.C. 
bar examination, which Knox failed. The remainder of his life was a succession of personal and professional disappointments.2 He returned to 





Illinois




 in 1937. He initially landed a position with a prestigious 

Chicago
 law firm but was fired when he failed the 





Illinois




 bar examination. Although Knox finally passed the exam (on his third attempt), he never acquired a secure and permanent position with a firm. An attempt at running his family's already faltering mail-order book business after his father's death proved disastrous, but Knox eventually found his niche in the Chicago claims office of the 
Allstate Insurance Company, a 
Sears subsidiary, working there until his retirement in 1973.5


Knox was a member of the Bars of 





Illinois




, 





New York




 and of the 

Supreme Court of the United States
. He also belonged to the 
Society of Mayflower Descendants, the 
Society of Colonial Wars, the 



Sons of the American Revolution


, the 
Sons of the Revolution, and the 
Society of the War of 1812. Knox's club at 
Harvard was 

Lincoln's Inn
.4


The dwindling value of the Sears stock on which Knox's retirement income was
based made his last years difficult. A lonely bachelor who struggled with prostate cancer the last decade of his life,5 Knox died in 1997 in Oak Park, leaving many of his papers (including his letters from Civil War Veterans) to Harvard Law School.4

Dallas Moir (born 
April 13, 
1957) was a 

Maltese
-born 

Scottish
 
cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a slow left-arm bowler who played for 

Derbyshire
 between 1981 and 1985.

Moir had made his Second XI debut for 

Derbyshire
 in 1980, and made his Derbyshire debut against the Bears in the Second XI Championship a year later. He appeared for the first time in the County Championship in the same year, taking one wicket on his first-class debut. The 1981 season was to prove mediocre for Derbyshire, and he was to find himself almost as inactive in the first team as he was in the Second XI.


Moir's breakthrough came in the 1982 season, as he found himself elevated to the first team, where he stayed for three years. He finished playing first-class cricket in 1986, after representing 
Scotland in an innings victory against 
Ireland. Moir's sole century innings came against Warwickshire in July 1984. Moir's twin brother, 
Jeremy, played first-class cricket for Scotland in the NatWest Trophy and the Benson and Hedges Cup between 1989 and 1992.

The 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 78th midseason exhibition between the 
all-stars of the 

American League
 (AL) and the 

National League
 (NL), the two leagues comprising 

Major League Baseball
. The game was held on July 10, 2007, at 





AT T Park




, the home of the NL's 










San Francisco Giants









. It marked the third game held in 

San Francisco
, 

California
 (but the fourth overall in the 



Bay Area


, with 

Oakland
 hosting once) and the second straight held in an NL ballpark. 


The American League defeated the National League by a score of 5-4. As per the 
2006 
Collective Bargaining Agreement, the 




American League champion



 (which eventually came to be the 










Boston Red Sox









) received 
home field advantage in the 




2007 World Series



.1 The victory was the 10th consecutive  (excluding the 






2002 tie





) for the AL, and their 11-game unbeaten streak is only beaten by the NL's 11-game winning streak from 
1972 to 
1982 in All-Star history.



Background

 
As with each All-Star Game since 
1970, the eight starting position players (with no 
designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, and 


a second fan balloting

 to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32 players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons. 


The Giants were awarded the game on February 9, 2005.2 The game marked the first time since 
1953 that one league hosted consecutive All-Star Games, after 

Pittsburgh
, 





Pennsylvania




, hosted the game in 






2006





. 


The game was the fifth straight All-Star Game to decide home-field advantage in the 





World Series




.1 The AL entered the game on a ten-game unbeaten streak (nine wins, with one tie in 






2002





). The NL was looking for their first win since the 






1996 game





 in 

Philadelphia
.




Fan balloting



Starters


Balloting for the 2007 All-Star Game starters (excluding pitchers) began on April 27 and continued through June 28.  The top vote-getters at each position and the top three among outfielders, are named the starters for their respective leagues.  The results were announced on July 1.3 About 18.5 million votes were cast by close to twelve million fans.3 


Alex Rodriguez

 was the leading vote-getter with 3,890,515 votes, easily outpacing his 




Yankees



 teammate 


Derek Jeter

 by over 700,000 votes. 

Ken Griffey, Jr.
 was the top vote-getter in the 

National League
, with 2,986,818 votes.3




Final roster spot


After the rosters were announced, a second round of fan voting, the 

Monster
 


All-Star Final Vote

, was commenced to determine the occupant of the final roster spot for each team.4 This round lasted until July 5. 


Chris Young

 and 

Hideki Okajima
 were elected to represent the National League and American League, respectively, in the All-Star Game as first time All-Stars.5 All ten players included in the balloting were 
pitchers, a first for the event.

Game summary


The National League got things started in the bottom of the first when 
Jose Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter 

Dan Haren
 and proceeded to 
steal second.12 He scored on an 
RBI single by 

Ken Griffey, Jr.
 to give the NL a 1-0 lead.12 


Barry Bonds

 nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for in the bottom of the third when, with Reyes on second, he lofted a high fly ball to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by 
Magglio Ordonez.12 The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when 


Alex Rodriguez

 attempted to score on a two-out single by 
Ivan Rodriguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed 


Russell Martin

 to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning.12 The AL would score one inning later when, after 


Chris Young

 issued a leadoff walk to 

Brian Roberts
, 

Ichiro Suzuki
 hit a long fly ball off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what became the first 
inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history.13 The homer gave the AL a 2-1 lead.


The lead would be augmented in the sixth when 

Carl Crawford
 hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run.12 Though it appeared a fan may have 
reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager 

Tony La Russa
 did not challenge the umpires' call.14 The NL got a run back in the bottom of the inning when 
Carlos Beltran led off with a triple and scored on a 
sacrifice fly by Griffey.12 The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when 
Victor Martinez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5-2 lead.12 


The American League's closers then entered the game, with 

Jonathan Papelbon
 pitching a scoreless bottom of the eighth.12 In the ninth, 

J. J. Putz
 tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out 

Brian McCann
.12 Pinch-hitter 

Dmitri Young
 rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to 

Brian Roberts
, but he could not come up with it. 

Alfonso Soriano
 followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one.12 After Putz walked 

J. J. Hardy
, AL manager 







Jim Leyland






 replaced him with 
Francisco Rodriguez.12 However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked 

Derrek Lee
 on a check-swing 3-2 pitch and then 

Orlando Hudson
 to load the bases.12 In a move that drew criticism,15 La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, 

Albert Pujols
, and instead let 

Aaron Rowand
 hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by 
Alex Rios to close the game,12 earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.

Home Run Derby





Main article: 
2007 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby

The 

State Farm
 




Home Run Derby



 was held the night before the All-Star Game, July 9, and broadcast on 

ESPN
. Four players from each league competed to hit as many home runs as they could in each round to advance and eventually win the contest. This year, a five-swing swing-off would be used to break ties occurring in any round. This became necessary when 

Albert Pujols
 and 

Justin Morneau
 tied for fourth in the first round. The champion of last year's Derby, 

Ryan Howard
 of the 








Philadelphia Phillies







, competed even though he was not named to the NL All-Star roster.16


In the finals, 

Vladimir Guerrero
 of the 










Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim









 defeated 
Alex Rios of the 




Toronto Blue Jays



 by a score of 3-2.17 Guerrero hit 17 home runs in all, second only to Rios' 19. Guerrero also hit the longest blast of the competition, a 503-foot (153 m) drive to left field that just missed hitting a giant replica glove and baseball set up on the concourse beyond the left field bleachers.


AT T Park is distinguished by having the 




San Francisco Bay



 beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as 






McCovey Cove





, named for legendary Giants slugger 







Willie McCovey






. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in 
kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by 

Prince Fielder
 did reach the water.18 This was largely due to the three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.19


Gold balls were utilized whenever any player had one out remaining during his round. Any home runs hit with the balls meant Major League Baseball and State Farm would pledge to donate money to the 
Boys   Girls Clubs of America. Due to the change in sponsors from 

Century 21
 to State Farm, each ball's value was reduced to 
US$17,000 to reflect the 17,000 State Farm agents in the United States and Canada.17 In all, twelve gold ball home runs were hit, which, along with a $50,000  bonus  constituted $254,000 raised for charity.20

Apt











Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heshel of 
Apt, popularly known as the Apter Rebbe or Apter Rov, was born in 
Zhmigrid, 

Poland
 in 1748 and died in 











Mezhbizh










, 

Russian Empire
 (now 

Ukraine
) in 1825.


 Rabbinical career 


A scion of famous rabbinic families, on both his father's and his mother's side (his family can be traced back to 
Maharam Padua and 









Saul Wahl








), Avraham Yehoshua Heshel showed great promise even at an early age. Acquiring fame as a 
talmudic scholar, he studied under Rabbi 
Elimelech of Lizhensk and Rabbi Yechiel Michl of 
Zlotchov. Becoming one of the foremost spokesmen of the growing 
Chasidic movement in 

Poland
, he began his career as Rabbi of 





Kolbasov




. In 1800 he accepted the post of Rabbi of Apt, or 
Opatow. Although he held many other rabbinic positions, to the chasidim he remained always the Apter Rov. In 1808 he was chosen as Rabbi of 
Ia i, 

Moldavia
. In the wake of communal strife there he was forced to leave his post and settled in Mezhbizh, the home of the 
Baal Shem Tov and the cradle of Hasidism, where he devoted himself completely to the study and dissemination of 
Chasidism.


It was during this period in his life, in Mezhbizh, that he gained the veneration of thousands of followers, among whom were a number of the prominent rabbis of the age. His outstanding character trait was his strongly expressed love of the 
Jewish people, which earned him the title of Oheiv Yisrael,  Lover of Israel . Oheiv Yisrael became the title of the published collection of his thoughts arranged according to the weekly 



Torah


 portions. The work abounds with lofty kabbalistic insights and interpretations. It is one of the basic chasidic texts, and bespeaks the Apter Rov's passionate love of his fellow 


Jew

s. The Apter Rov is one of the most notable and beloved luminaries on the hasidic firmament.


On his deathbed, crying bitterly over the long exile, he said:  Before his demise 






Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berdichev





 promised that upon entering the World-to-Come he would not rest or sit until 
Mashiach would come. But they diverted his attention by teaching him lofty and mystical concepts, until he forgot his pledge but I assure you, I will not forget. 


He was buried in 











 Mezhbizh










, near the 
Baal Shem Tov. An ornate stone ohel marks his grave in the old Jewish cemetery.  According to one hasidic legend, angels subsequently carried his body and buried him in the Holy Land, and in the Jewish Cemetery in 

Tiberias
 there is a stone marking his supposed grave.




 The Hasidic dynasty of Mezhbizh/Zinkov 





Main article: 







Apta (Hasidic dynasty)








Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heshel of Apt was the founder of the Mezhbizh/Zinkover rabbinic dynasty. In honor of the dynasty's founder, his descendants adopted the family name Heshel.

Malazan Book of the Fallen




The 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
 
fantasy series by 


Steven Erikson

 and 
Ian Cameron Esslemont contains numerous intelligent human, 
humanoid and non-human races.  They are divided into the four founding races (the 
Forkrul Assail, 
Jaghut, 
K'Chain Che'Malle and 
T'lan Imass) who evolved on the Malazan planet, and the Tiste invader races (the 
Tiste Andii, 
Tiste Edur and 
Tiste Liosan) who immigrated to the Malazan planet from their racial 
Warren.  The 
Thelomen Toblakai are descended from the race known as the Thel Akai.


 Eres 


The Eres are a pre-founding race in the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
.  Before all races, there was the Eres'al, a hairy, primitive precursor to the 
Imass.  The Eres appeared to survive as 
nomadic hunter-gatherers or scavengers, following herds and predators for food.  They appeared to have developed a 
symbiotic relationship with the Deragoth, the Hounds of Darkness, possibly becoming domesticated by the Hounds.



 Physiology 


The Eres are human in appearance, walking upright with fully human features and hands. One difference is a thick layer of fine hair covering the body.  




 Culture 


The culture of the Eres preceded all other intelligent humanoid races, including the 
Imass. They worked stone with somewhat less skill than the Imass themselves.  Though they were the first to exhibit 
awareness or 
consciousness, they failed to develop a sophisticated culture like the human, Imass, 
Forkrul Assail, 
K'Chain Che'Malle or 
Tiste races.  




 Interactions with the Malazan Empire 


To date the Eres' interactions with the 







Malazan Empire






 were limited to the possession or accompaniment of one soldier of the Adjunct's rebel army.  




 Appearances in the Novels 


An Eres named Eres'al, the Nerek goddess, has appeared several times.  She inhabited the body of Tavore's 'lover', T'amber.  She has assisted 
Quick Ben in defending against the attack of a 
Edur Warlock in 

The Bonehunters
 and then again assisted Quick Ben in preventing Icarium from reaching the First Throne in The Bonehunters. Also in the same book, the Eres'al-possessed T'amber died protecting Tavore from dozens of Claw Hands.  An Eres '
took the seed' of Trull Sengar also. She has an obsession with Bottle, Strings' (Fiddler's) squad mage who has some control over an 
elder magic called 
Holds.





 Forkrul Assail 


The Forkrul Assail are one of the founding races in the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
.  They exist in isolation, interacting with other races through violent arbitration of conflicts, more accurately the annihilation of the involved parties.



 Physiology 


The Forkrul Assail are humanoid, although taller and thinner than humans, possess more joints in their limbs and hands, a jointed 
sternum, large, solid black eyes and blue blood rather than red.  They are physically far more robust than humans, and appear to be virtually un-killable through conventional means, healing from cuts and blows extremely quickly.  They also possess incredible strength, speed and agility, and are able to successfully combat several powerful opponents at once while sustaining only minor wounds.  In addition, they have preternatural longevity and can live for millennia without food or water.




 Culture 


Forkrul Assail seem to lack a collective culture, existing primarily in isolation.  Generally, the Assail only gather to pass judgment and arbitration when requested by other races, though this arbitration seems to take the form of killing all involved in the conflict.   Their names seem to reflect this obsession with arbitration.  Their 
architecture is formed by tunneling into stone forming underground buildings, which mimic the pillars and windows of aboveground buildings.  The continent referred to as 
Assail is said to be the most dangerous place on the planet.




 Interactions with the Malazan Empire 


To date the Forkrul Assail has not interacted with the 







Malazan Empire






.




 Appearances in the Novels 


The Forkrul Assail make two major appearances, one in the novel 

House of Chains
 and again in 

Midnight Tides
.  


In the first appearance, 


Karsa Orlong

 and his companions, Bairoth Gild and Delum Thord, released the Assail named Calm after thousands of years beneath an 
invested block.  Subsequently, Calm attacks Karsa and inflicts a brain injury on Delum Thord, reducing him to a dog-like state.  Calm escapes with ease.  The second appearance finds an Assail, Serenity, released from enchanted bindings.  Serenity is attacked by Fear, Trull, Rhulad, other Edur tribesmen, and two Kenyll'rah demons.  Serenity kills Rhulad Sengar before being driven off by the two Kenyll'rah who followed excitedly.  


There are no further direct appearances by the Forkrul Assail in the novels, but they are mentioned tangentially in other passages.
E.g. in Reaper's Gale (near end Ch 13), where Beak tells about Tiste Liosan and Forkrul Assail fighting against each other in what they called the Just Wars.


A Forkrul Assail body is also found in Tremorlor, the Azath House in the Holy Desert Raraku.





 Jaghut 


The Jaghut are one of the founding intelligent races of the Malazan planet.  They are solitary, powerful beings who once dominated much of the world after the eradication of the 
K'Chain Che'Malle.



 Anatomy 


The Jaghut are taller and broader than humans, with tusked lower jaws.  Their skin is grey-green and hair is generally grey. As confirmed in The Bonehunters, the Jaghut possess two hearts, and possibly duplicates of other organs, in a manner similar to that of the Thelomen Toblakai. The Jaghut are extremely long-lived (essentially immortal in the sense that they will not die except through violence or accident), and capable of inter-breeding with humans and 
Thelomen Toblakai.  Whether the offspring are viable is unknown.  They are adapted to living in a cold climate, and generally prefer an 
Arctic environment.  The Jaghut primarily use the Omtose Phellack 
Warren, an Elder racial Warren that allows them control over great areas and is generally tuned towards magics of ice, cold, stasis and preservation.  The Warren can also produce effects of '', isolating whole continents from the rest of the world. In one case, this prevented the magic of the continent of 
Lether from evolving for over 300,000 years.




 Culture 


The Jaghut do not gather in locations or create communities. They see community leading to power over others (by the civic leaders), leading to dominance, hunger for power, slavery and a downward spiral into Tyranny over all other living things. Instead, they prefer solitary towers as dwellings, usually living with only their closest family.  Despite this tendency towards isolation, their parental instincts are very strong, which has resulted in a scaling up of conflicts with the 
T'lan Imass - if a parent is attacked, their spouse and children will come to fight with them, and vice versa.  This can result in considerable devastation due to the scales of sorceries involved.


The exception to the rules of isolation are the rare Jaghut known as Tyrants, for whom conquest and rule is an unslakable thirst.  These individuals will use their powerful magical capabilities to enslave and dominate other races.  In the most recent novel, 

Toll the Hounds
, it was hinted that Jaghut once had great civilizations. The reasons for why their fall happened and why the Jaghut live in solitude is due to the uprising of their slaves, the Imass.


As a result of the Tyrant Raest's actions, in this regard, the Imass underwent the ritual of Tellan and became 
undead, and from thus forth known as the T'lan Imass.  For the battle between the Imass and the Jaghut, there is never any quarter given - if any trace of the Jaghut is found by the Imass, a 
pogrom is raised in which several clans converge on the site until their army is wiped out or all of the Jaghut are slain.




 Interactions with the Malazan Empire 


During the main events of the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
, Jaghut are almost unknown except as legends.  The rare individuals who have survived the 
pogroms of the T'lan Imass exist in solitude and hiding, using 
Warrens other than Omtose Phellack or restricting their activities to other realms where the T'lan cannot find them. 


One interaction with the 







Malazan Empire






 to date has been the awakening of a bound Tyrant by the Imperial Adjunct and the First Sword of the T'lan Imass, Onos T'oolan.  The pair roused the Tyrant in an effort to produce 
mutually assured destruction between Raest and the lord of the 
Tiste Andii, 


Anomander Rake

.


The other point of interaction takes place in  





Memories of Ice




  where a psychologically abused Jaghut leads the 
Pannion Domin against the free cities on 
Genabackis and is contested by 
Caladan Brood's Horde and the outlawed 2nd Army of the 







Malazan Empire






.  This conflict devastates most of the 2nd Army.  Ganoes Paran and Quick Ben of the Bridgeburners make contact when reuniting this Jaghut with his sister.




 Appearances in the Novels 


The Jaghut have appeared in minor scenes in the other novels, most notably 

House of Chains
 and 

Midnight Tides
.  From these appearances, it is apparent that the Jaghut are more active than the T'lan Imass would suspect, generally working behind the scenes and in hiding to ensure the continued isolation and binding of dangerous creatures.


It has also been strongly hinted that the Lord of Death, Hood, is a Jaghut.




Descendants



Jhag


The Jhag are half-blooded Jaghut living in the Jhag Odhan area of the 

Seven Cities
 continent. 


The half-Jaghut 
Icarium is a major character in the series and appears in 

Deadhouse Gates
, 

House of Chains
, 

The Bonehunters
 and 

Reaper's Gale
.  He shares the immortality of his Jaghut father, Gothos, and when roused to anger is an uncontrollable, nearly unstoppable force of death and destruction.  In the past, Icarium has laid waste to entire cities, and is a threat to the Azath.  The Azath is a nearly indestructible entity that detains powerful beings like a prison.  Because of Icarium's rage, he is always bound to a companion who works in secret to prevent him from being roused to anger.  During Deadhouse Gates, House of Chains and the beginning of The Bonehunters, his companion was the Trell Mappo Runt, however Mappo was attacked and replaced as Icarium's companion with the Gral warrior Taralack Veed.  The source of Icarium's rage is fueled by the Azath's entrapment of his father, Gothos.  However, Gothos is actually quite content in his situation since he, like most Jaghut, enjoys solitude as is provided by the Azath. It is revealed in Reaper's Gale that Icarium's mother was a 
Thelomen Toblakai, however that does not necessarily imply that all Jhag's are a Toblakai/Jaghut mix.






 K'Chain Che'Malle 


The K'Chain Che'Malle were one of the founding intelligent races in the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
, the only race that is non-humanoid.



 Anatomy 


The K'Chain Che'Malle are intelligent 
lizards standing taller than a man, moving 
bipedally by balancing the weight of their torsos with a tapering tail (much like 
velociraptors and other bipedal lizards) and pale skin similar to the underbelly of a snake.  The K'Chain Che'Malle exist as two breeds, the most noticeable difference is the length of the tail.  There were the original long-tails (K'Chain Che'Malle) and the engineered short-tails (K'Chain Nah'ruk).  Most of the K'Chain Che'Malle appearing in the novels have been undead or seen in visions of the past, with the exception of a single Matron on 
Genabackis and a male and female on the continent of 
Lether.  To date the only time they have spoken with other races was with Silchas Ruin in a parley attempt, though it is unclear if the parley actually happened or if Ruin simply sought it.




 Culture 


The K'Chain Che'Malle were the first race on the Malazan world to evolve intelligence, and developed a culture of technological and magical sophistication hundreds of thousands of years before the evolution of 
hominids.  Most knowledge of the K'Chain Che'Malle is retrospective, developed through inspection of their cultural ruins thousands of years after their extinction - as such, it is difficult to state anything definitive about them.  It is known that they are 
eusocially ruled in the manner of 
ants, with a single female queen (the Matron) and thousands of male drones and soldiers.  


The K'Chain Che'Malle appeared to lack a racial 
Warren to draw upon, instead employing 
gravity-based magic that mixed heavily with their technology.  They inhabited gigantic structures known as Skykeeps, buildings so large they appeared to be floating mountains.  Currently the only Skykeep known to exist in the Malazan world proper is the one used by the 
Tiste Andii, Moon's Spawn, though others have been seen in the Imperial Warren. Most Skykeeps were destroyed during the 
civil war that exterminated their race.


The Short-Tails were an engineered experiment that broke from the control of the long-tailed Matrons due to the Short-Tail's independent nature and resistance of the Queen.  This resulted in a civil war between the two breeds. In addition to internal struggle, a massive 
Tiste invasion occurred, evidently destroying their race, though at least one Matron survived until the events of the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
. 




 Interactions with the Malazan Empire 


The only interaction between the 







Malazan Empire






 and the K'Chain Che'Malle occurred at Coral, in a battle between the 
T'lan Imass, Malazan forces, and the 
Barghast versus the undead K'ell Hunters of the long-tailed K'Chain Che'Malle and the forces of the Pannion Domin.  The undead versions were slower and more resistant to normal, mortal pain.




 Appearances in the Novels 


The K'Chain Che'Malle have appeared in four novels in the series so far, 





Memories of Ice




, 

Midnight Tides
, 

The Bonehunters
, and 

Reaper's Gale
.





 Thelomen Toblakai 


The Thelomen Toblakai are an intelligent, humanoid race found in the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
.



 Physiology 


The Thelomen Toblakai are humanoid, though taller and generally more physically robust than humans, with broad, flat faces.  Pure-blood Toblakai stand at over seven feet tall, and disproportionately muscled enough to seem wide.  They are capable of interbreeding with humans to produce viable half-breeds, but seem to have a different evolutionary descent, as marked by having four 
lungs rather than two.  On the continent of 
Genabackis (where 


Karsa Orlong

, the most prominent Toblakai comes from) the tribes of the Teblor appear to have several advantages which are wholly contained to their tribe.  The Teblor heal much more quickly than humans do, to the point where bruises can be seen to visibly fade.  They are also invulnerable to infectious diseases and possess a limited immunity to 
magic.  Lower level magic does not affect them and even High level magic may fail or not have its intended effect.  This may be a natural protection as a result of 
physiology, or possibly due to their consumption of blood-oil, a compound which may contain the magic-deadening 
otataral.  This consumption of blood-oil may also be the cause of their rapid healing, but this is not explained as of 

Reaper's Gale
.


It is known that certain Thelomen Toblakai can become their own 
Warrens; the exact abilities and circumstances that surround this are unknown. Karsa Orlong appears to be one such, channeling his Warren into the ability to ignore the structures and effects of spells, even Elder such as the 
T'lan Imass' Tellann.  However, Karsa Orlong and his tribe's immunity to magic may also come from the use of blood-oil.




 Culture 


Thelomen Toblakai or their descendants are scattered across the Malazan world, and appear to exist on all continents under a variety of names - Teblor, Fenn, Tarthenal and Toblakai.  They are a fallen people; once possessing high civilization, cities and books, most now live in tribes and eke out a barbaric existence breeding horses and feuding with nearby tribes.  The greatest details are known about the Teblor on 
Genabackis through the story of 


Karsa Orlong

.  At some point long ago, the Teblor built cities on the Genabackis, but for an unknown reasons their blood became  thin and clouded.   Icarium, the half-
Jaghut/Toblakai, gave them rules to purify their blood, separating husbands, wives, and children into different tribes and giving them laws to live by and a new society based on the raising of horses, hunting, raiding, and fishing.  Thousands of years later, the Teblor live in their separate tribes, some of which have vanished, some of which have become enslaved by nearby humans.  


On the continent of 
Lether, the Tarthenal have been conquered and enslaved by the Letherii.  They lived north of the city Letheras.  Their culture is forgotten and one of the few activities they still remember are the rituals of propitiation for their terrifying gods.  They had five gods, called the Seregahl, the Wrath Wielders.  The gods of the Tarthenal were not worshiped to draw their attention and blessings, but instead sacrifices were performed to turn their gazes away and keep them from manifesting.  When the Tarthenal were conquered, their lasts acts were to die defending their shrines, terrified not of the attackers, but of their own gods.  These gods were killed by Silchas Ruin with help from the Avowed of the Crimson Guard, Iron Bars, and the Tarthenal, Ublala.




 Interactions with the Malazan Empire 


The Theloman Toblakai have had various interactions with the 







Malazan Empire






.  


Karsa Orlong

 was enslaved by the Malazan Empire and transported to the 
Seven Cities continent, and later came across the Malazans in the aftermath of the battle in Raraku.  


Bellurdan Skullcrusher is a Thelomen Toblakai mage in the Malazan army.  He appears briefly in 

Gardens of the Moon
, and is mentioned in 

House of Chains
 as the High Mage who forged the 
otataral-quenched long-knife bought by 
Kalam.  The weapon in question proves that Bellurdan uses an Elder Warren, as the knife was invested, an impossible task with human 
Warrens due to otataral's magic-deadening properties.




 Appearances in the Novels 





Main article: 


Karsa Orlong



The tribes of the Teblor and the character Karsa Orlong are the most prominent Thelomen Toblakai in the Malazan series.  He appears in 

Deadhouse Gates
, 

House of Chains
 and 

The Bonehunters
.  Karsa is a phenomenal combatant, incredibly swift, decisive and vicious.  He occupies (unwillingly) the position of Knight of Chains in 
High House Chains of the 
Deck of Dragons.  


On the continent of 
Lether, the fallen Tartheno play a role in the events surrounding the conquest of the Edur.  A half-Tarthenal criminal is instrumental in preventing the five Tartheno gods from escaping the Azath house and saving the Avowed Crimson Guardsman Iron Bars.  


The Toblakai mage, Bellurdan Skullcrusher, appears in 

Gardens of the Moon
, battling 


Anomander Rake

, grieving his slain lover Nightchill, and finally dying at the hands of the Cadre Mage Tattersail only to have his soul shifted into Silverfox body.  


In 





Memories of Ice




, it was revealed that the Toblakai traveled with the mortal 
Imass who were not in time for the Ritual.  The Imass eventually evolved into the Barghast people who live on 
Genabackis.





Thel Akai




 Physiology 


Thel Akai are described as  giants  standing even taller than Tarthenal Theloman Toblakai, who are their descendants. When they die, they turn to earth and soil,  returning to the earth .




 Culture 


According to Ereko, the last Thel Akai, the Thel Akai were not a war-like people, and often encouraged humans in their development. They fell foul of the High King Kallor when they aided his opponents, and he vowed to destroy every one of them. Jacuruku is the Thel Akai homeland, and upon its soil, Ereko refuses to draw a weapon.




 Interactions with the Malaz Empire 


None, although Ereko travelled with Dassem Ultor for a time.




 Appearances in the Novels 


Ereko, the last Thel Akai, is Dassem Ultor's travelling companion in 





Return of the Crimson Guard




. For how long or how they met is not divulged. Ereko is described as  kind and wise  by Kyle.





The Tiste


The Tiste races are humanoid, but alien to the world of the Malazans.  With their epicanthic eyes, height, and long lifespans, the Tiste are the closest that the Malazan series comes to involving 
elves.  Each of the three Tiste races are  children  of either the Elder Warrens of Light (
Liosan), Darkness (
Andii), or Shadow (
Edur).  Each also has a 






Soletaken





 
draconean leader birthed directly by the forces that gave rise to each race: 
Anomander Rake, 
Andarist, and 
Silchas Ruin (Tiste Andii) from Mother Dark, 
Osserc (Tiste Liosan) from Father Light, and 
Scabandari Bloodeye (Tiste Edur) from both Mother Dark and Father Light, forming Shadow.  Each leader is considerably more potent than the rest of their more common kin and were considered the undisputed leaders of their respective races.  Rake still leads his people, while Osserc has turned away from that role while Scabandari Bloodeye was forcibly removed from it.  



 Tiste Andii 


The Tiste Andii are a race found in the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
.  They are not one of the four founding races but invaders from another world.  



 Anatomy 


The Tiste Andii are taller than humans are, though of similar proportions.  Their skin is black (not in the sense of indigenous inhabitants of 






Africa





, but actual black in the true sense of the color), with slanted, 
epicanthic, almond-shaped eyes that change color with their moods.  Their hair is silver, white, black, or rarely red, and generally kept long.  The Tiste Andii are extremely long-lived (


Anomander Rake

 is at least 300,000 years old), and aging is slow.  Barring accidents or death through violence, they may live 
forever.  Some Eleint Andii (Dragon mix-blood) keep a younger appearance normally between twenties and forties.  The Tiste Andii are close kin to the 
Tiste Edur and 
Tiste Liosan, though they do not share 
genetic descent or respect.




 Culture 


The Tiste Andii are invaders from the Warren of Darkness, and are therefore not native to the Malazan world.  Long-lived and slow breeding, the Tiste Andii as a race tend towards melancholy and apathy.  The majority of the Tiste Andii lived in Moon's Spawn for many millennia, an ancient 
K'Chain Che'Malle Skykeep that they have taken over after finding it abandoned in the Arctic of Genabackis.  For years the Andii traveled the world as decided by 


Anomander Rake

, their half-Andii, half 
draconic 






Soletaken





 ruler.  In much of this time, they acted as 
mercenaries for causes decided upon by Rake.  A detachment, led by Rake's brother Andarist, dedicated themselves to protect the Throne of Shadow on the island of Drift Avalii.


The Tiste Andii from the original invading population formed an alliance with the Tiste Edur against the K'Chain Che'Malle.  These Tiste Andii lead by Silchas Ruin were betrayed by their Edur ally, Scabandari Bloodeye.  Those not murdered live in Bluerose, a tiny mountain city inland of the Letherii empire living in hiding for thousands of years and ruling the human population from the caverns under the city itself.




 Interactions with the Malazan Empire 


The Andii's primary interactions with the 







Malazan Empire






 occurred in their role of paid mercenaries opposing the Malazan armies at Pale and Darujhistan, and in cooperation with the exiled Second army against the Pannion Domin.  After the fall of Coral with the city in sorcerous darkness, the surviving Andii settling in the area exist in a state of political flux - the Malazan empire claimed the area around Black Coral that belonged to the Pannion Domin before its fall, while the Andii claim sanctuary and ownership of the permanently shadowed city.  The shadowing of the city was caused by a full unveiling of their power.




 Appearances in the Novels 


The Tiste Andii make major appearances in the novels, most notably in 

Gardens of the Moon
 and 





Memories of Ice




, though a minor character appears in 

The Bonehunters
.  

Reaper's Gale
 features an Andii from Bluerose, an assassin and Mortal Sword of the Black Winged Lord, named Clip.  Also, a regiment of Andii appear briefly in  

House of Chains
   when 
Cutter and 
Apsalar aid 
Andarist's followers fend off an 
Edur raid to obtain the Throne of Shadow.





 Tiste Edur 


The Tiste Edur are a race found in the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
.  They are not one of the four founding races but are invaders from a shattered world.  



 Anatomy 


The Tiste Edur are taller than humans, though of similar proportions.  Their skin is a dull grey colour of a hue not found in humans, with slanted, 
epicanthic, almond-shaped eyes.  Hair ranges from dark red to dark brown, and greys with age.  The Tiste Edur are close kin to the 
Tiste Liosan and 
Tiste Andii, though they do not share genetic descent.  The Tiste Edur are looked down upon by the Tiste Liosan and with hatred by the Tiste Andii on Lether.  The Edur are extremely long-lived, but unlike the Andii and Liosan are not immortal.  Female Edur mature more quickly than males.




 Culture 


The Tiste Edur originally come from the Shattered Warren, Kurald Emurlahn, the Elder Warren of Shadow.  The Edur were originally invaders from the Warren, forming a large part of the army that fought the 
K'Chain Che'Malle along with the Tiste Andii.  After the battle, the Edur turned on the Andii and wiped them out.  The Edur's leader, Scabandari Bloodeye, disappeared shortly after and the Edur decayed from an advanced species into a tribal group isolated to the northeast portion of Lether and several other minor pockets on other continents, such as far west of Seven Cities.  


All comments that follow refer to the majority of the species located on the continent of Lether.  


Descent is patrilineal, though the females have a strong influence over the family.  The Edur are organized into tribes, and these tribes became united prior to 

Midnight Tides
 by Hannan Mosag, the Warlock King.  Decisions are made with input from the elders of the tribe, though blooded warriors are allowed to observe events.  The Edur also have elaborate funeral rites where gold coins are melted on the skin of the Edur dead and then they are placed in the Bloodwood forest with a guard to protect the body from spirits looking for a vessel.  After the ascent of the Emperor, Rhulad Sengar, the Edur became far more warlike and dominated by the commands of the Emperor.




 Interactions with the Malazan Empire 


The Tiste Edur has had significant interactions with the 







Malazan Empire






.  During the events of 

The Bonehunters
, the main fleet of the Malazan Empire crossed paths with one of the exploratory fleets of the Tiste Edur.  The Edur threatened to destroy the Malazan fleet with sorcery, but the Malazan High Mage 
Quick Ben bluffed his way past with unknowing help from Bottle and the goddess Eres'al, thus allowing the fleets to pass without conflict.  


Another contact with the Malazan Empire proper is during 





Memories of Ice




 when the Malazan 2nd army encounters a body of an Edur who has undergone extreme compression caused by sudden appearation/teleportation in the deep depths of the sea.


In 

Reaper's Gale
, the Malazan 14th Army, although not acting under the authority of the Empress, invaded the continent of Lether and defeated numerous Tiste Edur armies sent against it until it liberated the capital city, Letheras, from Edur rule.




 Appearances in the Novels 


The events of Midnight Tides almost exclusively discuss the interactions between the Edur and the human empire of Lether, from contact to invasion and conquest.  There is also the aforementioned contact of the two fleets within The Bonehunters.  The events of 

House of Chains
 also features the character of Trull Sengar, an outcast of the Tiste Edur, who is freed by a 
T'lan Imass within one of the fragments of the Shattered Warren named Nascent.  Also stitched throughout the series is the ongoing appearance of the Silanda, an Imperial 
dromon which features disjointed appearances of the Tiste Edur and the aftermath of their encounter with 


Karsa Orlong

.





 Tiste Liosan 



The Tiste Liosan are a race found in the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
.  They are not one of the four founding races and only have contact with the Malazan world due to a breach of the barriers surrounding their Warren of 
Kurald Thyrllan possibly through the human use of Telas, the 
Path of Fire and the Imass use of the Tellann, the 
Warren of Fire.



 Anatomy 


The Tiste Liosan are taller than humans, though of similar proportions.  Their skin is pure white, (not in the sense of 
caucasians, but actually white in the true sense of the color), with slanted, 
epicanthic, almond-shaped eyes.  Hair is silver or gold and generally kept long.  The Tiste Liosan are close kin to the 
Tiste Edur and 
Tiste Andii, though they do not share genetic descent. Internal anatomy differs from the human norm; specifically, the heart known to be buried deeper in the torso.   




 Culture 


The Tiste Liosan source from Kurald Thyrllan, the Elder Warren of Light, and are not native to the Malazan world.  In contrast to their apathetic kin, the Tiste Andii, the Liosan are high tempered, arrogant and zealous, dedicated priests of their god of light, Osserc.  They viewed Trull Sengar as a lesser species of Tiste, which only showed their haughtiness.They are the least well-known of the Tiste races, and have the least contact with the Malazan world.  Socially, the Liosan appear to be martially organized and hierarchical, led by warrior-priests.




 Interactions with the Malazan Empire 


The Liosan have had no actual contact with the Malazan empire as of 

The Bonehunters
.  




 Appearances in the Novels 


The Tiste Liosan make the fewest appearances of the Tiste races in the Malazan series.  Four Liosan warriors appeared in 

House of Chains
, engaging briefly in combat with Trull Sengar, a Tiste Edur and Onrack, a 
T'lan Imass.  They are then forced to co-operate with Sengar, Onrack and several other Imass in order to escape the shattered 

Warren
 they are trapped in.  Subsequent to this they escape into the Malazan world, but, after nearly dying at the hands of Malazan sappers, they decide to retreat to their own Warren.  The other Imass cause the destruction of the demon posing as Osserc (Osserc placed the demon there for he did not want the position of god of the Tiste Liosan).  This caused the attention of the Tiste Liosan named L'oric, son of Osserc, who then has to find his father.  Osserc is found and does not return immediately, instead L'oric makes a deal with a demon and they return from Raraku's memory which was similar to a warren.






 T'lan Imass 


The T'lan Imass are a race found in the 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
, and one of the Founding Races.



Anatomy


The T'lan Imass are humanoid, though shorter and squatter than humans.  Originally living, the entire race underwent the ritual of Tellann hundreds of thousands of years in the past (previous to the founding of the 







Malazan Empire






), the single greatest 
necromantic ritual ever occurring within the Malazan world.  This resulted in all present becoming 
undead - unable to die.  They are able to dematerialize to what they would have been if there was no ritual - dust - and can then transport hundreds of 
leagues, and re-form into their physical bodies.  As a result of hundreds of thousands of years of existence, many of the Imass are desiccated, their skins worn through and many have broken bones and missing body parts.  Their eyes are shrivelled in their sockets and vision has been replaced with the ability to sense the 'flame of life' that surrounds living beings.  It allows them direct perception of heat, colour, movement and magic.  The physical bodies of the T'lan Imass appear to be based on that of 







Neanderthal






s.




Culture


The T'lan Imass no longer have an appreciable 
culture that changes or evolves, having become fixed at the completion of the ritual of Tellann.  Originally, they existed as a tribe and clan-based society of stone-age hunter-gatherers, whose technology had advanced to cold-hammering metals and creating elaborate stone tools (including sword-sized flint blades that would shatter without sorcerous 
investment), but had not reached the level of forging or casting metals.  They were also the slaves to 
Jaghut Tyrants, which caused the Imass to undergo the Ritual to combat all Jaghut.  The three hundred thousand years of their history has been dominated by the pursuit and elimination of all the living Jaghut, tracking and eliminating them throughout the 
Warrens and on the Malazan world.


Nearly the entire population of the Imass underwent the Ritual of Tellann, though some individuals chose not to participate and were cast out, while others were unable to arrive in time, eventually evolving into the 
Barghast.  An effect of the ritual (beyond undeath and transformation to dust) was the production of a fixed purpose, where the entire race is consumed by the same goal of eliminating their enemies.  This focus is removed should they sustain a significant amount of damage without being completely destroyed, at which point the individual must submit themselves for destruction or become hunted outcasts by the rest of the race.  




Interactions with the Malazan Empire


The T'lan Imass' main connection to the 







Malazan Empire






 occurred when Kellanved found and sat on the First Throne, essentially becoming the ruler and commander of a clan of Imass that was in range of the magic of the throne.  Since that point, the Imass were involved in several military campaigns, most notably on the 
Seven Cities continent.  After Kellanved's ascension, the Imass were mostly uninvolved in the actions of the Empire except for a revenge attack ordered by Kellanved, now named Shadowthrone, to attack the city of Aren in Seven Cities in an act to disrupt the ruling of Laseen - the alleged murderer of Kellanved and 


Dancer

.




Appearances in the Novels


The T'lan Imass appear in all of the novels of 

Malazan Book of the Fallen
 to date, in varying degrees. In 

Midnight Tides
, the T'lan Imass are not directly named, but their identity can be inferred by references to a Bonecaster (shaman) and their physical description. In all other novels, their involvement is more explicit. The most significant appearances are in 





Memories of Ice




, where the appearance of a mortal Bonecaster (shaman), in connection with Itkovian, the Shield Anvil of Fener, allows the Imass to be freed from the emotional consequences of the ritual of Tellan, and begin a life ruled by the twin wolf gods, Fanderay and Togg (their original gods before the Ritual). The known T'lan Imass ascendants include the Whirlwind Goddess and Apsalar, Goddess of Thieves, who has been promised to play a major part in the forthcoming novel 

Toll the Hounds
. 




Descendants




Barghast



The Barghast descend from seagoing 
Imass, and Thelomen Toblakai who landed across the various islands of Wu. The Barghast living in different areas all have similar cultures despite having had no contact with each other. Before this time they (or their Imass and Thelomen Toblakai ancestors) met with and warred against seafaring 
Tiste Edur. 


Note: the actual descent of the Barghast is debatable;  Memories of Ice  indicates descent from the Imass only, though mentions that they landed  throughout the known world  and had similar culture.
Whereas  House of Chains  first indicates the Barghast are descended from the seafaring Thelomen Toblakai (which explains their size) then mentions that they traveled together with the living Imass (who did not take part in the ritual of Tellan).


The White-Face clan landed on the continent of 

Genabackis
, and they are the most prominent Barghast in the series. 


The Barghast have been both allies and opponents of the 







Malazan Empire






 throughout the series.  They are divided into clans and lead by a single leader.  Trotts, a 
Bridgeburner who had Barghast blood, fought in a duel to gain rights to kinship and create his own tribe.  After narrowly winning, his tribe consisted of the Bridgeburners.




Moranth



The Moranth are a  group of 
Imass descendants on 
Genabackis.  They made peace with, lived with, and learned from a group of lost seafaring 
Tiste Edur. This acceptance of the Tiste Edur antagonized the 
Barghast, other descendants of Imass, which caused a cultural split.  Despite the split between Moranth and Barghast cultures their languages are still comprehensible to each other as admitted by Twist in 





Memories of Ice




. He also claims that Moranth 
alchemy is based upon lore gained from Tiste Edur.


The Moranth live in the Moranth mountain range on Genabackis, wearing 
insectile 
chitinous armor and riding oversized dragonfly-like creatures called quorls for transport and into battle.  They are divided into clans: Blue as the navy and fishing; Green as transport and courier; Black as the military force; Gold  as the elite military force; and Silver as the mages.


The Moranth are allies of the 







Malazan Empire






, providing them with the alchemical explosive 







Moranth munitions






 responsible for major changes in the battle tactics of the empire and the creation of 
sappers, explosives experts. The reason for the alliance is likely due to the Moranth's wish for revenge on the peoples of Genabackis. When Pale was taken by the 2nd Army and the Black Moranths the Moranth conducted an Hour of Blood. During this time 12,000 Pale citizens were massacred - one for each Moranth death (in recorded history); directly or indirectly caused by the people of Pale. The alliance's militaristic advantages are diminishing (whilst still being valuable, it is becoming less so) due to mass Moranth casualties, and unwillingness to co-operate on some occasions.


One notable Moranth is Twist who fought with Onearm's Host and spoke to the 
 Bridgeburner's officers.




Trell



Trell are  short and wide with brown skin, and black hair braided with fetishes.  Their canines are bigger than a 
Jhag's.  The Trellish lands lie west of the Jhag Odhan on the 

Seven Cities
 continent and remain nearly untouched by civilization.  A Trell named Mappo Runt is the companion of the 
Jhag Icarium.






Humans


Humans share 
common descent with the 
Imass, along with the Barghast, Moranth, and Trell. They are the  Traditional  response to the question  what happened to the living Imass who didn't arive in time for the ritual?  -  They eventually evolved in to humans.   Humans are divided along political and geographic lines, akin to the 

races
 of Earth.



Dal Honese


The Dal Honese live in southern 

Quon Tali
, on the Dal Hon Plains.  Dassem Ultor, 
Shadowthrone, 
Iskaral Pust and his wife Mogora are Dal Honese.




Daru


The Daru occupy the 
city state of Darujhistan on the continent of 

Genabackis
; the city was originally founded due to rumours of a treasure-filled 
barrow which actually held a 
Jaghut Tyrant.  The mage Kruppe and thief/assassin Crokus/Cutter are from Darujhistan.




Faraed and Nerek


The Faraed were tribal people who lived north of 

Lether
, trading with the Letherii until the Faraed became 








Indebted







, resulting in conquest and assimilation of the culture.  The tribal Nerek shared the same relationship with the Lether as the Faraed, and suffered a similar fate.  The Nerek worship the goddess Eres'al.




Gadrobi


The Gadrobi are an indigenous people in central 

Genabackis
.




Genabarii


The Genabarii are a people in north-west Genabackis.




Meckros


The Meckros live in massive, floating cities that travel across the oceans and trade with people on land.  The only character to come from Meckros as of 

Reaper's Gale
 is Withal, the weaponsmith, whose city was destroyed.  A second city was found frozen in Coral Bay by Lady Envy and company.  Withal also appears in 

Midnight Tides
, after ice had destroyed his city leaving him the only survivor.




Napan


Napans are from the Napan Isles near Malaz Island, east of 

Quon Tali
.  The Napans allied with Kellanved to take control of Unta on the continent of Quon Tali, forming the 







Malazan Empire






.  Napans have a uniquely blue skin colour, and are notable for being massively muscled and unconcerned with aesthetics.  


Laseen, the current Empress of the Malazan Empire, is Napan; as is Korbolo Dom, renegade Fist, and the 
Admirals Nok, Cartheron Crust and Urko Crust.




Rhivi


The Rhivi are a 
pastoral 
nomadic society in the central plains of Genabackis. The Mhybe was of the Rhivi, and Silverfox was raised with the Rhivi.




Seti


The Seti inhabit western 

Quon Tali
, but have been so thoroughly integrated into the Quon culture they have effectively disappeared.




Seven Cities tribes


There are many native tribes living in 

Seven Cities
, including the Arak (in the Pan'potsun Odhan), Bhilard (east of the Nenoth Odhan),  Can'eld (northeast of Ubaryd), Debrahl (northerly regions), Dhis'bahl (in the Omari and Nahal Hills), Gral (from the Ehrlitan foothills down to the Pan'potsun Odhan), Kherahn Dhobri (in the Geleen Plain), Khundryl (west of the Nenoth Odhan), Pardu (north of the Geleen grasslands), Semk (in the Karas Hills and Steps), Tithan (south of Sialk) and the Tregyn (west of Sanimon).




Wickan


In northeastern 

Quon Tali
 lies the Wickan Plains where live the horse warriors, the Wickans.  They are divided into clans, including Foolish Dog, Weasel and Crow.  Coltaine, Fist of the 7th Army and leader of the Chain of Dogs, is a Wickan of the Crow clan, as was veteran commander Bult, the lancer Temul, and 
warlocks Sormo E'nath, Nether and Nil.

Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox are the names of a pair of large statues of the American folkhero 


Paul Bunyan

 and his ox, located in 

Bemidji, Minnesota
. This roadside attraction has been on the 





National Register of Historic Places




 since 1988. Much like the architecture found in such structures as the 








Benewah Milk Bottle







, the 





Teapot Dome Service Station




 or the comparably colossal 





Dinosaur Park




 sculptures in South Dakota, it served to attract the attention of motorists passing by and coincided with the dramatic rise in the popularity of automobiles.1 


The statues have been hailed by the Kodak Company as the  second most photographed statues in the United States , behind only 














Mount Rushmore













 in South Dakota.2



History

   
The city of Bemidji is located in a vast woodland and lake region. As early as the 1890s the town saw a modest tourist trade. When rail connections came to Bemidji, in 1898, promoters began the development of lakeshore sites for cottages, hotels and resorts. Most of these resorts catered to hunters and anglers. In the 1920s the rise in 
automobile popularity contributed to a significant boom in Bemidji's tourist industry, but it, along with the rest of the economy, suffered during the 





Great Depression




. Enter 


Paul Bunyan

 and Babe the Blue Ox.1   


As a means of stimulating tourism in Bemidji a number of local, civic organizations sponsored a winter carnival meant to hype the city's resources for 
winter sports. On 
January 14, 
1937 the carnival opened. Due to Bemidji's once prominent status as a 
logging and lumbering center the celebrations focused on Paul Bunyan, the larger-than life 
lumberjack who is an American 
folk hero. The onset of the carnival brought the unveiling of two giant statues, one of Bunyan and the other of his giant blue ox, Babe; the pair would serve as carnival mascots.1   


In March 2006 the 
Rotary Club of Bemidji raised $53,000 and along with a $68,000 federal grant set about to repair some damage to the statues. In addition the money was to be used in maintenance with the majority slated for stabilizing the ground beneath the statues, to lessen shifting in freezing temperatures. The work also focused on a one inch wide crack in Babe from the neck to the hindquarters which continued to widen despite yearly fixes by the city with caulk and blue paint.2 




Dimensions


Paul Bunyan is approximately 18 
feet3 tall and measures five feet across at his base. From toe to heel, Paul Bunyan measures three feet. The Blue Ox, Babe, is about ten feet tall and eight feet across at the front hooves. From nose to tail, Babe measures about 23 feet.1

Horse racing venues in Australia




Cheltenham Park Racecourse is a 
horse racing 
track located in the suburb of 

Cheltenham
 in 

Adelaide
, 
South Australia. It is situated north-west of the centre of the city and approximately five kilometres from 

Port Adelaide
. The track is 2052 metres in circumference with a 325 metre straight.1

The 
Port Adelaide Racing Club began 
thoroughbred racing at the course and in 1921 the club bought the site on which the course stands for  25,000. The champion horse 
Tulloch became the first Australian horse to pass the  100,000 stakes mark when he won he S.J.Pullman Stakes at the track in 1961. Administration of the course was taken over by the 
South Australian Jockey Club in 1975.


In November 2007, the SAJC sold the racecourse land for AUD $85 million for a new housing development.23 It has been proposed that the money will be used to help fund the 





Victoria Park Racecourse




 redevelopment.

M-137 is a 

state trunkline highway
 in the 








U.S. state







 of 

Michigan
 that serves as a spur route to the Interlochen Music Camp, 
Interlochen Arts Academy, and 





Interlochen State Park




.  It starts at 

US 31
 in 

Grand Traverse County
 and terminates at the park 2.890 miles (4.651 km) away. Although M-137 is near the much longer 

M-37
 designation, the two have never been related to one another. M-37 in the area was a section of 

M-42
 at the time M-137 was designated.


Route description


M-137 starts at the Interlochen State Park south of the community of 




Interlochen



 (farther south, the road is known as Grand Traverse County Road 137). It runs north, connecting the 

Interlochen Center for the Arts
 and 





Interlochen State Park




 and the with the rest of the state trunkline system at 
US 31 at Interlochen corners. The entire route is two-lane rural highway, winding through wooded terrain between Green and Duck lakes. The roadway continues north of US 31 as S. Long Lake Road after the M-137 designation.




History


The early history of M-137 shows some confusion. Two new trunklines were added to the state system on 
1929-12-02, one in the Upper Peninsula is initially shown on maps as M-137, one in the Lower Peninsula is not given a designation. The 1931 state official map shows that the UP routing in 

Schoolcraft County
 is given the 

M-99
 designation and M-137 is applied as the connector route to the Interlochen State Park. This routing would be extended on 
1931-08-17 by .9 miles (1.4 km). The route would be realigned and completed on 
1956-03-06, moving M-137 off the campus of the Interlochen Center for the Arts.

Early Modern Japanese texts




The Taik ki (   , Taik ki) is a 
biography of 








Toyotomi Hideyoshi







, who rose to the office of 
taik  during the 
Azuchi-Momoyama period of 
Japanese history. The 

Confucian
 scholar 
Oze Hoan (     1564 1640) published the work in 
1626 during the rule of the third 
Tokugawa 

shogun
 

Iemitsu
. The complete work spans 20 
scrolls. 

The Taik ki shows the influence of Hoan's individual views of history and interpretations of historical materials. 


Modern 
historical novels based on the Taik ki include the Shinsho Taik ki by 






Eiji Yoshikawa





, Ihon Taik ki by 
S hachi Yamaoka, and Shinshi Taik ki by 
Ry tar  Shiba. Yoshikawa's novel was the basis for the yearlong 

NHK
 television 
Taiga drama Taik ki (1965). Shiba's novel and others of his works gave the story to Kunitori Monogatari (1973), another Taiga drama.

Town 102 is a radio station serving

The station plays  Just Great Songs for Ipswich . It features competitions and also provides local news and information for the Ipswich area.



FIS FM


On April Fools Day 2008, the station played a joke on the listeners of the station, claiming they had been taken over by a window company. The jingles on the day sounded a mix between Town 102 and a  dark-ish  ident of FIS FM. (Comment by a Digital Spy forum user).


Until 12.00pm on that day, they referred to themselves as FIS FM. However, listeners of the station were unhappy and took it seriously, sending in text messages of disgust.


On the Town 102 website, a poll was put up asking Have you been affected by an April Fool today?, 26% said yes. The 
RDS was left unchanged. After 12pm, the station returned to its normal output.

During 
August 
2008, Bob Strong, Town's mid-morning presenter was 'missing' from the airwaves. Fans of the 

Wolverhampton
 born presenter, on 

Facebook

Tindle Radio themselves refused to give an explanation as to Bob's disappearance.


On 




Thursday



, the 21st of 
August, the local paper; 










East Anglian Daily Times









 published a story 1 on the missing presenter, however, despite their attempts; the paper failed to get any information from the PC at Town or from the head of 
Tindle Radio.


On the 27th 
August 
2008, fans left angry at the unexplained disappearance of Bob Strong from his programme were to hold a protest. This prompted Town to release a statement 2 days later explaining that Bob had left (see below).


On the 29th 
August 
2008, Town 102 sent an e-mail to those who contacted them   told local press that the mid-morning presenter had left the radio station.23

Americans for Peace Now (APN), the 








United States







 partner of 

Israel s
 





Shalom Achshav (Peace Now)




 organisation, is an American organization working to help Israel achieve a secure peace with the Arab states and the 

Palestinian people
. APN believes that Israel s security and democratic character cannot be maintained if it continues to remain in a state of conflict with its Arab neighbors, including the Palestinian people. 

APN has a wide array of educational programs that reach out to the American public and Jewish American communities around the country, and works to mobilize grassroots support among U.S. citizens. By working directly with policy makers in the 

White House
, 

State Department
, and 

Congress
, APN promotes US policies that further the peace process.



 History 


In 
1978, 348 senior Israeli army officers wrote a letter to Prime Minister 
Menachem Begin calling for peace between Israel and 

Egypt
. The letter stated,  the government policy, perpetuating its rule over a million Arabs, could harm the Jewish-democratic character of the state, and makes it difficult for us to identify with the task. Mindful of Israel s security needs and the difficulties on the path to peace, we nevertheless consider that real security can be achieved only when we achieve peace. (
full text of the letter). This petition led to the creation of Shalom Achshav (Peace Now in Hebrew), a grassroots movement dedicated to raising public support for the peace process.


APN was founded in 
1981 to support the activities of Shalom Achshav. APN s activities have grown to include: media outreach and monitoring, government relations, and public outreach.




 Activities and stated goals 



APN is the voice of people who support Israel and believe that only peace will ensure Israel s security, prosperity, and continued viability as a Jewish, democratic state. Positions advocated for more than two decades by APN and Shalom Achshav   like calling for the evacuation of settlements and the creation of a viable Palestinian state   are now recognized by most Israelis and non-Israelis as basic requirements both for peace and for a secure future for Israel. APN s activities include:



 Action network 


APNs Action Network generates immediate and forceful grassroots responses to political developments though its national membership base.




 Government relations 


APN builds relationships with Members of Congress, Congressional staff, and Executive Branch officials in order to educate them about important developments in the Middle East and the implications of policy choices presented to decision makers. In 2005, 
Roll Call newspaper quoted a congressional staffer saying that APN's government relations program is  second to none. 




 American Jewish community outreach 


Through its membership in the Conference of Presidents of major American Jewish organizations, APN works with other mainstream American Jewish groups to support peace for the Palestine and Israel.




 Media outreach and monitoring 


APN promotes its goals through press releases, editorials, and personal contacts with reporters. It is a respected source of balanced information on the Middle East, providing insightful commentary and analysis to interested journalists. APN monitors over 400 media outlets and generates responses on an as-needed basis.




 Public outreach 


APN published a weekly email/fax newsletter on Middle East events, along with a quarterly newsletter and other information sheets. In addition, it maintains an active web site with the latest information from the organization, and it sends speakers to communities around the country to promote the cause of peace. Some of the publications that APN promote their issues through are Peace Now News, Middle East Peace Report, Jerusalem Watch, Settlement Watch and APN Facts/Fax




 Goals Stated at PeaceNow.Org 





 An American Jewish community and general American public educated about the strategic and economic benefits of security through peace in the Middle East.


 Active White House and State Department engagement in the peace process, especially Administration efforts to broker a new interim understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, facilitate final status arrangements that reconcile Israeli security with Palestinian statehood, and encourage negotiations between Israel, Syria, and Lebanon.


 Congressional support for the peace process through continued aid to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians.


 Broad awareness in the United States of the benefits of Shalom Achshav programs in Israel.


 A firm financial base for Shalom Achshav and APN activities.1







 Successes 



In the wake of the 

Hamas
 electoral victory in January 2006, H.R. 4681, The Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, was introduced to the 

United States House of Representatives
. After analyzing the legislation, APN found that the bill would censure and punish all Palestinians, and close the door on any future negotiations to achieve peace with Palestinians. 


APN worked with Members of Congress and legislative staff in the U.S. House of Representatives to improve and strengthen the bill. APN pushed for a US policy that pressures Hamas, seeks to avert a humanitarian disaster, and facilitates the eventual return to peace negotiations. These efforts ensured that the bill went through mark-ups in two House Committees, including the House International Relations Committee, where the bill was improved to deal with some of the specific concerns raised by APN   albeit not improved enough for APN to endorse the result.


The Senate version of the bill, S. 2370   introduced significantly later than the House version, after APN s advocacy and educational efforts were underway   was significantly better than H.R. 4681. Like H.R. 4681, the Senate legislation sends a sharp message of rejecting terrorism, while giving the President more flexibility to conduct foreign policy and preserves the possibility of producing US and moderate Palestinian relations. In December 2006, the House passed the Senate version of the bill.




 Position on settlements 



Recognizing that settlements in the 
West Bank represent a security liability for Israel and an obstacle to future peace efforts, APN encourages the Israeli government to and work toward the creation of a Palestinian State. APN has advocated that the Bush Administration is on record in opposing the expansion of settlements and in favor of Israel's removing illegal settlement outposts. President Bush's oft-repeated vision of a future Palestinian state, living alongside Israel, each country secure in its own borders, can never be realized if Israel continues to expand settlements and further consolidate its hold over land in the West Bank.


The economic and security challenges facing Israel are exacerbated by continued investment in settlements and refusal to rein in renegade settlers who persist in establishing new settlement outposts. Polls show wide support among Israelis for a settlement freeze, dismantling of outposts, and settlement evacuations. Polls also have shown that most settlers would accept withdrawal from settlements in the context of a peace agreement and a compensation program. By making it impossible for Israel to disengage from the West Bank, settlements ensure that the government of Israel will eventually govern an area in which non-Jews outnumber Jews. Israel will thus be forced to choose between remaining a democracy and losing its character as a Jewish state, or retaining its character as Jewish state at the expense of democracy.




 Organization timeline 






 1978 - Founding of 





Shalom Achshav (Peace Now)




 The largest grassroots movement in Israel's history is founded in 1978 by 348 reserve army officers and combat soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces.







 1979 - Forging the First Peace On the eve of Prime Minister Begin's historic trip to negotiate peace with Egypt, Shalom Achshav mobilizes hundreds of thousands of Israelis in a massive demonstration of public willingness to trade land for a secure peace with an Arab neighbor. Begin would later write that this demonstration was on his mind as he negotiated at Camp David.







 1981 - Establishment of Americans for Peace Now Networks of support for Shalom Achshav emerge around the United States and a national movement begins to form.







 1982 - Ending the war in Lebanon Following the massacres of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps by the Phalangist militia, Shalom Achshav helps to rally 400,000 people - 10% of Israel's population - in a successful effort to demand a government commission of inquiry and an end to the war in Lebanon. 







 1985 - Building Bridges to the Other Side Shalom Achshav initiates dialogue and reconciliation projects with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. 







 1988 - Speak Peace with the 






PLO





 Shalom Achshav launches its campaign  Speak Peace with the PLO  helping to legitimize dialogue and pave the way for the 





Oslo negotiations




. 







 1989 - Promoting Peace in Times of Crisis As the Intifada and violent retaliation escalates, Shalom Achshav organizes  Hands around Jerusalem,  a landmark partnership as 25,000 Israelis and Palestinians linked hands to encircle the walls of the Old City in a chain of peace. 







 1990 - Launching of Settlement Watch project This project has become one of the most reliable and respected sources of information on settlement activity. 







 1993 - Creating a Shalom Achshav youth movement Thousands of Israeli youth have been mobilized throughout Israel and have helped facilitate a parallel development among Palestinian youth in the West Bank and Gaza. 







 1994 - Establishing Ir Shalem project This project opposes housing eviction and land confiscation of Palestinians in Jerusalem and promotes policies that seek equity and unity among all of Jerusalem's residents, Israeli and Palestinian.







 1996 - Groundbreaking tour by Israeli and Palestinian youth From the White House to inner-city high schools, they traveled the United States sharing their ideas about reconciliation, offering hope even in the face of a new wave of suicide terrorism. 







 1997 - Expanding Washington advocacy APN launches its Action Alert Network program in support of American mediation efforts in the Arab-Israeli conflict. 







 1998 - APN presents Creative Policy Options Presenting ideas to breaking the protracted negotiating deadlock and challenging both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat to live up to their Oslo obligations. 







 1998 - APN hosts 


Yitzhak Rabin

 peace award APN Begins an annual award ceremony honoring individuals that further the United States commitment to the Israel and Palestinian Peace process.







 2002 - Over 100,000 Israelis rally for peace Peace Now and the Israeli Peace Coalition launched a major new campaign to end the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Under the banner,  Get Out of the Territories, for Israel s Sake,  over 100,000 Israelis responded to this call and rallied for peace in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv on May 11th. 







 2003 - APN Hosts Geneva initiators Americans for Peace Now (APN) played a major role in hosting several Israelis and Palestinians who worked on the 





Geneva Accord




 when they were in Washington. With the assistance of APN, the Geneva team had a tremendous impact on government officials and the media. 







 2005 - Israel unilaterally withdraws from the Gaza Strip Israel unilaterally withdraws from all permanent Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip and from four settlements in the northern West Bank. Peace Now supported the withdrawal, although it repeatedly called for the withdrawal to be negotiated with Palestinian Authority President Abbas. 







 2006 - Settlement report Peace Now published a report stating that 40% of Israel settlement land is owned by Palestinians. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are built on land which the Israeli government recognizes as privately-owned by Palestinians, as opposed to  state land  whose ownership is unclear, or land owned by Jews. (The report may be seen at 
November. An update of the report can be found at 
March.)

2006 elections in Africa
Elections in Mauritania





Parliamentary and municipal elections in Mauritania occurred on 
19 November and 
3 December 
2006.12 At least 28 political parties competed to comprise the lower house of parliament, the 





National Assembly




; 











Islamist










 parties were banned, but many Islamists ran as independent candidates. 95 seats in the National Assembly were at stake in the election, along with over 200 local councils.3


About 600 independent candidates ran in the election, many of whom were grouped into the 

National Rally of Independents
 (RNI). Many members of the RNI were formerly members of the 
Democratic and Social Republican Party, which had ruled the country under President 

Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya
.4


Before the first round's count was complete, 





Ahmed Ould Daddah




 claimed victory for his party, the 

Rally of Democratic Forces
 (RFD), saying that it was  the country's biggest political force , and claiming that the eight-party coalition including the RFD had won a majority. The 
Popular Alliance for Progress (APP), a party for former slaves that is also part of the coalition, and the renamed former ruling party, the 
Republican Party for Democracy and Renewal, were also reported to have performed well.5 Results from the first round confirmed a strong showing for the RFD, which won 12 out of the 43 declared seats;36 independent candidates also did well, taking 24 seats.6 For 52 seats, however, candidates did not receive majorities and these seats had to be decided in the second round.36


After the second round was held on 
3 December, the coalition of former opposition parties had 39 seats (including 15 for the RFD), with an additional two seats for independents supporting the coalition. Independents won 41 seats, 39 of which were part of the RNI. The former ruling party won seven seats.4


17.89% of the deputies elected were female.4








Messaoud Ould Boulkheir




 of the APP was elected as President of the National Assembly on 
April 26 
2007. There were 93 deputies present for the vote, and 91 of them voted for Boulkheir; two other deputies, 
Babah Ould Ahmed Babou and 
El Arbi Ould Jideyne, each received one vote.7

QIK - (

Qantas
 Intelligent Keypad) is an intelligent 
airline 
agent application first developed in the late 1980s as a 
front end to 
mainframe 
computer reservations systems.


QIK was designed   developed by Qantas Airways1 as a productivity tool for use in the airline's reservation call centres. The Q.I.K. acronym as derived from its use of a separate keypad attached to the keyboard. The keys on the 
keypad acted as function keys. In later versions the physical keyboard was disposed of and replaced with a logical keypad represented as a quadrant on the user's screen mapped to standard 
QWERTY keyboard (F1-F12) function keys.


Marketed under the brands QIK,1 QIK-RES2   QIK-CHEK2 these applications encapsulate 
airline business rules in a PC based smart application and send the required transactions to the airline mainframe or host for processing. In doing the training time for an airline agent could be reduced from 6 weeks down to 2 weeks. In addition the automation of host transactions eliminated format entry errors. This reduced the need to resend transactions and led to a reduction in mainframe usage costs for airlines.


In the early 1990s 

Qantas
 formed a joint venture operation with DMR Consulting to market QIK and other transportation IT solutions under the name of Qadrant International. In 1997 DMR Consulting purchased the remaining 49%3 stock of Qadrant off Qantas Airlines to become the sole owner of the company.4 Qadrant went on to develop later versions of QIK in conjunction with Sabre Decision Technologies (SDT),5 an AMR/

American Airlines
 subsidiary. This joint development exercise expanded QIK from the DOS platform to the OS/2   Windows platforms and was brought to market as QIK-II.

Weingarten's was a grocery chain that served

, 

Arkansas
, and 





Louisiana




 until it went out of business in 1984.     


History


Harris Weingarten and his son, Joseph, opened a grocery store in downtown 

Houston
 in 1901. A second store opened in 1920. Advertising  Better Food for Less,  Joseph Weingarten pioneered self-service and cash-and-carry shopping. Weingarten's chain of stores in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana grew by 1926 to six; by 1938 to twelve; by 1951, twenty-five; and by 1967, seventy. 


To concentrate on real estate development for retail shopping centers, Weingarten Incorporated sold its stores, which had grown to a chain of 104 stores in five states, to 










Grand Union









 in 1980. Grand Union then resold most of the stores to 

Safeway
 (Safeway acquired 43 of the stores), 

Randall's
, and 
Gerland's Food Fair in 1984, including 55 stores in the Houston area. However, lease provisions at several locations barred the automatic transfer of leases between operators. Because Weingarten's and 










Rice Food Markets









 couldn't agree on a disposition of the Post Oak Center lease, Weingarten's continued to operate the store at that location until April 1986.

Villages in Nottinghamshire
United Kingdom articles missing geocoordinate data




Fiskerton is a small village in 

Nottinghamshire
 on the west bank of the 



River Trent


 about 5 miles southeast of 

Southwell
. Regarding the old boat ferry from Fiskerton to 
East Stoke,  Up until the middle of this century (1950s) there was a ferry boat service over to the other side of the 



River Trent


 at Stoke Field. 1. Fiskerton Mill lies on the River Greet only a few hundred yards upstream from its junction with the 



River Trent


.2






Fiskerton Windmill was a wooden 
postmill with a substantial brick roundhouse, standing off Station Road. A mill was marked at this site on Chapman's map of 1774. The mill ceased working some time in the last quarter of the 19th century. Only the roundhouse now remains 3.


The village's  location beside the 
Trent makes it a magnet in the summer months for walkers, picnickers and casual visitors. 4 The village has a popular riverside pub called the Bromley Arms. The landlord reputedly also does boat trips on the river on request. The village  is very popular in the summer months with tourists, locals, walkers and anglers. 5


The Village is served by a 
Post Office, Village shop and Hair Salon.


The village of Fiskerton is also famous in 
Evangelical 
Christian circles as the homeplace of two of its famous residents, Henri and Connie Staples.6 They lived there from 1964-2000.7


They regularly held their 'revival meetings' in the 


Methodist

 Chapel. People from all over the world would travel to the village to catch a glimpse of these 'glory meetings.'8

Hudson Valley English is a special 
dialect of the 

English language
, found mainly in the 


Upstate New York

 regions around the 



Hudson Valley


 of the state. A very small number of the phrases that the people there use are derived from the Dutch language. Although it is very similar to other dialects, there are still a few minor difference. Some original Hudson Valley words are stoop (small porch) and teeter-totter. 1

It is also notable that there is a division about half-way through New York State, east of which the term  soda  is used to refer to sweet, carbonated (and often caffeinated) beverages, and west of which such beverages are called  pop .  In the Hudson and eastern Mohawk Valleys,  soda  is the preferred term.

Distribution, retailing, and wholesaling
Applications of computer vision
Counting instruments




A people counter is a device used to measure the number and direction of people traversing a certain passage or entrance per time unit. The resolution of the measurement is entirely dependent on the sophistication of the technology employed. The device is often used at the entrance of a building so that the total number of visitors can be recorded. Many different technologies are used in people counter devices, such as 
infrared beams, 
computer vision and 
thermal imaging.


Reasons for people counting


There are various reasons for counting people, the most common of which are:



Retail Intelligence


Use of people counting systems in the retail environment is necessary to calculate the 
Conversion Rate, i.e. the percentage of a store's visitors that makes purchases. This is the key performance indicator of a store's performance and is far superior to traditional methods, which only take into account sales data. Traffic counts and conversion rates together tell you how you got to your sales. i.e. if year-over-year sales are down: did fewer people visit my store, or did fewer people buy? Although traffic counting is widely accepted as essential for retailers, it is estimated that less than 25% of major retailers track traffic in their stores. 1




Planning of Staffing


Since staff requirements are often directly related to density of visitor traffic, accurate visitor counting is essential in the process of optimizing staff shifts.




Planning of Service Activities


Services such as cleaning and maintenance typically must be done when traffic is at its lowest or, occasionally, at a certain level. Planning of these activities necessitates accurate people counting.




Safety


For many locations it is essential to know how many people are inside the building at any given time, so that in the event of an evacuation they can all be accounted for. This can only be automated with the use of extremely accurate people counting systems.




Evidence of Resource Usage


Many public organizations use visitor counts as evidence when making applications for finance. In cases where tickets are not sold, such as in museums and libraries, counting is often required to be automated.




Measuring Marketing Effectiveness


Many shopping center marketing professionals rely on visitor statistics to measure their marketing. Quite often shopping center owners measure marketing effectiveness with sales. A trend has been to include visitor statistics to scientifically measure marketing effectiveness. Marketing metrics such as CPM (Cost Per Thousand) and SSF (Shoppers per Square Foot) are becoming very useful key performance indicators.





Technologies


Modern people counting systems use many different technologies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The main types are listed below.

A hand-held tally-counter, sometimes called a clicker-counter, would be used; one press per person. To reset the counter, one would have to turn a knob, resetting most counters' display to  0000 .




Infrared Beams


The simplest form of counter is a single, horizontal 
infrared beam across an entrance which is typically linked to a small 
LCD display unit at the side of the doorway or can also be linked to a PC or send data via wireless links and GPRS.  Such a beam counts a 'tick' when the beam is broken, therefore it is normal to divide the 'ticks' by two to get visitor numbers.  Dual beam units are also available from some suppliers and can provide low cost directional flow 'in' and 'out' data.  Accuracy depends highly on the width of the entrance monitored and the volume of traffic.


Vertical beams are somewhat more accurate than horizontal, with accuracies of over 90% possible if the beams are very carefully placed. Typically they do not give 'in and out' information, although some directional beams do exist.


Advantages:



 Inexpensive


 Simple to fit




Disadvantages:



 Most sensors are limited to non-directional counts


 Can't discern people walking side-by-side


 Cannot count high volume, uninterrupted traffic


 High potential to become blocked by people standing in an entrance or by merchandise or displays






 Computer Vision 



Computer vision represents the state-of-the-art system for people counting. These typically use either a 
closed-circuit television camera or IP camera to feed a signal into a computer or 
embedded device. Some computer vision systems have integrated links to database systems and retail 
point of sale systems.


Accuracy varies between systems and installations as background information needs to be digitally removed from the scene in order to recognize, track and count people. This means that CCTV based counters are vulnerable to light level changes and shadows, which can lead to inaccurate counting. If light levels are constant then high accuracy can be achieved, but counting at street level entrances, for example, can be inconsistent when sunlight shines into the view and then clouds move in front of the sun and the view then darkens. Sophisticated algorithms must be implemented to compensate for this behavior.


Advantages:



 High accuracy, in correct conditions sometimes over 98% 


 Directional information


 Flexible in customization


 Integration with other systems




Disadvantages:



 Higher cost than beam systems


 Less simple implementation than beam systems


 Accuracy can be affected by differing light levels






 Thermal Imaging 



Thermal imaging systems use sensors which detect heat sources, rather than using cameras as in computer vision systems. These systems are typically implemented using embedded technology.


Advantages:



 High accuracy


 Directional information


 Not affected by differing light levels


 Can count in complete darkness


 None intrusive usually ceiling mounted




Disadvantages:



 Higher cost than beam systems


 Less simple implementation than beam systems






 Synthetic Intelligence 


This system employs multiple IR transceivers to create a count zone at ankle height. The artificial intelligence counters function in a similar way to the human brain, in other words, each event is evaluated in terms of features to determine the correct outcome i.e. count per direction. As a person passes the count zone a pattern is generated. The onboard processor extracts the features of the pattern and based on what it has been taught makes a decision regarding the event by brute force calculation.


Advantages:



 Accuracy of 96% or higher 


 Directional information


 Discriminates between human and non-human objects


 Sensors can count in outdoor environments 


 Can count in all lighting conditions 


 Can count in complete darkness




Disadvantages:



 Larger, more obtrusive design than other types of sensing technology.


 High potential to become blocked by people standing in an entrance or by merchandise or displays.


 Cannot count high volume, uninterrupted traffic

Legacy systems




Legacy costs is a term formed by analogy with the computer industry's 
legacy systems. Legacy costs are those incured by an organization in prior years under different leadership or when the entity's priorities and resources were different. In business, while it can refer to other commitments (particularly existing 
infrastructure) as well, it primarily refers to company obligations to pay heath care costs and 
pensions under 
defined-benefit plans for current employees and retirees, usually incurred during the labor peace era after 







World War II






. Legacy costs are widely credited with handicapping American 
auto manufacturers and older 
airlines worldwide, diminishing their competitiveness. 
Organized labor sees such criticisms as part of a desire to abandon any form of 
social contract between worker and employer.

Newer, less-established entities have few or no problems with legacy costs, because they have less pension and health care liabilities. (this applies to new 
suburbs, for example, as well as new companies), and are therefore able to out-compete (in some cases) the older entities.

Nowhere to Hide, (Korean title, Injeong sajeong bol geot eobtda) is a 



1999


 

South Korea
n film, directed by 







Lee Myung-se






.

Nowhere to Hide was marketed as the Korean answer to 

Hard Boiled
, but the similarites are only slight in that both are cop films made in the far east.


The film is set in 
Inchon in South Korea. The plot of the film is simple, almost formulaic. A murder is committed in the opening reel, and the cops search for the killer. We are shown the comradeship of the cops, and the aggressive, underhand methods they use to hunt their man. An old lover of the killer provides the link to the wanted man.


Opening up in monochrome but with occasional flashes of colour, the first action scene is a disorientating strobelike affair. We revert to colour for the rest of the film, but there are still enough imaginative uses of montage, slow motion and wipes.


Additionally, there are 


Tarantino

-esque homages to past movie greats throughout the film. The opening stabbing on the 40 steps carries an obvious homage to 
Battleship Potemkin, and there are also nods to films such as 

Taxi Driver
, 

A Clockwork Orange
 and 

Eat Drink Man Woman
. Mention must also be made of the use of 
Holiday by 
The Bee Gees on the soundtrack.



Park Joong-hoon stars as the obsessive Detective Woo, a cross between 






Harry Callahan





 and 
Little Bill Daggett. Woo retains enough charisma however to remain sympathetic even when he is beating up suspects. There are plenty of fight scenes in the film but no martial arts. 

Jang Dong-gun
 won the best supporting actor at the 



Blue Dragon Film Awards


 for his role as Detective Kim.

Leisha Teresa Harvey (born 
4 April 
1947) is an 


Australian politician

. She was a 

National Party of Australia
 member of the 
Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1983 to 1989, representing the electorate of 
Greenslopes. She served as 






Minister for Health





 in the 
Ahern government from 1987 until her sacking in January 1989. She lost her seat at the election that December, and was not long out of parliament when she was charged with numerous counts of misappropriation of public funds concerning her usage of her official credit card. After a high-profile trial in 1990 and subsequent conviction, she spent five months in prison and a further seven months in home detention.


Background


Harvey was born in 1947 to displaced 
Polish parents in 
Munsingen, 

West Germany
. The family immigrated to 




Queensland



 when she was three, and she was raised in 

Brisbane
 thereafter, attending 
St Mary Immaculate Convent, Annerley, 
Buranda State School, 
St Ursula's College and 
Coorparoo High School. She studied education at 

Griffith University
 and was a teacher in the special skills program at 





Springwood High School




 for most of her career. A devout 


Roman Catholic

, Harvey attended the evangelical Garden City Christian Church in Brisbane's southern suburbs. Harvey married in 1965 and had one son and one daughter, but divorced in 1975. She remarried in 1983.1


Harvey contested and won 

National Party
 preselection for the seat of 
Greenslopes at the 






1983 election





. At the time, the seat was considered safe for the 

Liberal Party of Australia
, the National Party's former junior coalition partner. However, in the wake of the breakdown of the coalition in the early 1980s, the National Party poured resources into Liberal-held seats in an attempt to destroy their former partners. On election day, Harvey achieved a large swing, easily defeating incumbent Liberal and former minister 
Bill Hewitt and taking Greenslopes for the National Party for the first time in its history.2


As a backbencher, Harvey's speeches reflected her strong support of small business (having spent a period in small business herself), the rights of the aged and the need for consumer protection. She was staunchly opposed to sex discrimination, but equally opposed to affirmative action. An ardent opponent of homosexuality, she often stated that homosexuality would  never be legalised in Queensland. 3 She faced a minor scandal before the 






1986 election





 concerning use of her electorate printing allowances to aid her re-election, but was easily re-elected, and for a time was seen as something of a rising star in the party.45




Health Minister


In late 1987, amid mounting criticism from within the party, 
Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Premier of Queensland for nearly twenty years, resigned, and was succeeded by the more moderate 
Mike Ahern. Ahern immediately instituted a ministerial reshuffle, removing the heavily criticized 





Yvonne Chapman




, the state's first woman Cabinet minister, but promoting Harvey to the high-profile position of Minister for Health. Harvey thus became the only woman in the Ahern Cabinet and the second woman in Queensland history to serve as a Cabinet minister.67


Harvey's time as Health Minister, however, was plagued with difficulties from the beginning. She was forced to deal with a major health crisis which had sparked threats by hospital doctors to resign en masse, the 
Ward 10B scandal surrounding abuse of psychiatric patients at 





Townsville Hospital




, and recurrent issues over the storage of toxic medical waste. She also came under attack for appointing her daughter and sister-in-law to her paid staff, as well as a woman previously convicted on fraud charges, and using government funds to pay her hairdressing bills, leading the opposition to dub her  Minister for Goldilocks .89 She had a difficult relationship with many in the medical profession; David Lindsay, former head of medicine at the 

Gold Coast Hospital
, recounted in 2005 that Harvey  treated us like schoolchildren  and  told us how about how precious her time was and how we were wasting her time .10 Harvey's caucus colleague 
Di McCauley, herself later a minister, remarked in her 2004 memoir Diving Off The Ironing Board that Harvey  seemed unable to cope from the beginning in what was the enormous and difficult portfolio of Health. 11


One of Harvey's major tasks as Health Minister was to deal with the government's response to the growing 
AIDS crisis. The issue had been essentially ignored under Bjelke-Petersen, but under the more moderate Ahern, Harvey was tasked with taking steps to begin to address the disease. To this extent, she oversaw the legalisation of condom vending machines and needle exchanges, and instituted a program of AIDS education in schools.12 These steps were seen by some as inadequate, and her role was undermined by her poor relationship with the homosexual community.13 These issues came to a head in March 1988 when Harvey put out a departmental memo insisting that she be given unrestricted access to the medical records of AIDS patients, sparking a bitter battle over patient confidentiality, and repeated Opposition calls for her to be removed from the portfolio.1415




Downfall


Rumors had been mounting throughout late 1988 that Harvey was likely to be either demoted or fired, and in January 1989, Ahern announced that Harvey would be demoted to the position of Minister for Family Services, ostensibly on the basis of having failed to seek his approval for employing a woman who had previously been jailed for fraud. An angry Harvey responded by threatening to quit parliament and spark a by-election, which the government almost certainly would have lost. This was not taken well by many of her National Party colleagues, and after an internal outcry, Ahern retracted his prior decision and removed her from Cabinet altogether before she could be sworn in.16 Though she did not resign from parliament as previously threatened, she became an ardent backbench opponent of Ahern, and strongly supported his more conservative rival, 

Russell Cooper
, who toppled Ahern later that year.17


Harvey received a major defeat in the 






1989 state election





, losing her seat to Labor candidate 
Gary Fenlon with a 30% swing and finishing third behind both the Labor and Liberal candidates with only 11% of the vote.18 Three days later, as part of an investigation resulting from the findings of the 












Fitzgerald Inquiry











 into public corruption, she was one of five former National Party ministers to receive criminal summons by special prosecutor 
Doug Drummond QC on charges of misappropriating public funds.19 The charges concerned her use of her official credit card for 

AU$
42,364 in personal expenses, some of which it was alleged included taking her husband on a birthday trip to the 
Adelaide Grand Prix.2021 She was subsequently convicted of misappropriation on 13 of the original 124 charges, concerning a total of $7,900, and sentenced to twelve months in prison in November 1990. The Court of Criminal Appeal later reduced the convictions to nine counts but did not reduce the sentence. In April 1991, the judge struck down a further 20 charges and released Harvey to serve the last seven months of her sentence in home detention.22 Harvey was due to face a retrial on the remaining 71 charges, but these charges were dropped in July 1991 by the Director of Public Prosecutions.23 She was released from prison in early 1991, and has largely remained outside of public life in the years since.

Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas is a 2006 
animated 
direct-to-video 
film starring the 







Looney Tunes






 and directed by Charles Visser.  The movie is a spoof of the popular 



Charles Dickens


 tale, 





A Christmas Carol




.



Synopsis


As the movie's title implies, 


Daffy Duck

 stars in an 


Ebenezer Scrooge

-like role in the Looney Tunes retelling of this classic tale.


In the beginning of the movie, Bugs Bunny pops up out of his hole to clear away the snow, and explains to us he's a rabbit of all seasons, despite the fact rabbits are associated with Easter. He is then almost run over by Daffy Duck's gas guzzling 
Humvee.


Daffy is the owner of the Lucky Duck Mall (a 

Wal-Mart
 like megastore), and he treats his employees (played by other Looney Tunes) very shabbily. Despite Bugs' scolding him for berating Playboy Penguin, Daffy still acts snobbish and tries to abscond with the money Priscilla Pig, Egghead Jr., Henery Hawk and Barnyard Dawg Jr. are collecting for charity.  Daffy especially has trouble with his hover scooter, and gets beat up by his own employees (through no fault of their own) and the customers (since he insulted them).  After Daffy states he hates the holidays, Bugs warns him about the Ghosts of Christmas, which Daffy simply scoffs at.


After working his employees to the bone on Christmas Eve, Daffy expects them all back at 5:30am on Christmas Day, so he can make more money off of last minute shoppers.  Assistant Manager 


Porky Pig

 pleads to let him go home for Christmas and spend time with his daughter, Priscilla, who is in a Tiny Tim-like role, but Daffy refuses. Later that day, the spirit of his deceased business idol Sylvester The Investor (
Sylvester the Cat in a 







Jacob Marley






-like role) warns him to change his ways or be doomed to the same fate.  He tells Daffy that three spirits will visit him. Daffy, trapped in the store by a snowdrift, locks himself in his vault to be safe. But the ghosts are not that easily stopped. The Ghosts of Christmas Past (


Granny

 and 


Tweety

) take him back to his childhood, where they see Daffy lived at the Lucky Duck Orphanage and, every Christmas, was ignored by potential parents, which explains his cruelty in the Present Day.


The Ghost of Christmas Present (



















Yosemite Sam


















) shows him how sad his employees are and tells him if he doesn't change his ways, his future is very bleak. After a renactment of Bugs and Daffy's hiding rutean, The Ghost of Christmas Future (the 







Tasmanian Devil






) comes and shows him that because of his greed he is dead and his store is permanently closed, leaving everyone out of a job, but allowing them to spend Christmas with their families just like they wanted.


When Porky's daughter promises to visit Daffy every Christmas because no one should be alone on that holiday, Daffy's cold heart melts and he proclaims to be a changed man. Returning to the present, he gives Porky a promotion, everyone the gifts that they want and a promise of a raise. There is a brief moment when he slides back to his greedy self, contemplating just how he is going to recover all the costs, but it immediately fades and Priscilla kisses him. After Bugs munches on a candy cane, the camera pulls out of the mall to end the movie. Then, Porky and Priscilla finish the movie saying the famous line: T-T-T-That's all folks!

Telluride Ski Resort is a 
ski resort located in 

Telluride
 and 

Mountain Village, Colorado
.


The resort was founded by 

Joe Zoline
 who hoped to build a  world class resort  from scratch. Telluride's remoteness, Zoline acknowledged, is also what makes the resort special. Weekend warrior skiiers from the big cities don't get there by car.  This makes Telluride a more out of the way, full-service ski resort with exceedingly short lift lines. The small number of commercial flights directly into Telluride town airport (9000 ft high) limit direct access by air.  Access by air is greatly via nearby Montrose Colorado, with its lower elevation and long runways that accommodate regional jets from all over the US. Montrose is a 1 1/2 hour drive to Telluride.


Telluride Ski Resort (TelSki) was purchased in 
1999 by Joe Morita.1 Telluride was then purchased by a private investment group in 2003.



 Prospect Bowl (2002) 



Effectively doubling the amount of skiable terrain, Prospect Bowl was opened in 2002. Prospect Bowl is a veritable Disneyland of ski runs in and around islands of trees, with interesting ups and downs and its own lift #12. It includes High Camp, a new Warming Hut/Food Stop.  With the opening of Prospect Bowl, two new high-speed lifts were added, Lift #12 (mentioned above) and Lift #14, to access Gold Hill.


Gold Hill encompasses the highest portion of the ski area, previously only accessible by a hike of 30 minutes to an hour.  A short hike still remains for those who wish to add an additional 200 ft from the top of Gold Hill's Lift #14 to the highest ski run of the resort at 12,255ft. Although most of the runs descending from the top of Lift #14 are double black, there is an easy descent from this lift, coming down the See Forever ski run on top of the ridge with among the best alpine vistas in the world.




 Black Iron Bowl (2007) 



For the '07 - '08 ski season, the resort has opened the Black Iron Bowl, the steep smooth 1000 ft faces of Palmyra Peak overlooking Prospect Bowl.  Some skiing was permitted in these  Gate Access  areas with guides in the past.  For several years, the snowpack conditions were monitored and avalanche risks evaluated in Black Iron.  Now, the terrain will open, as conditions permit, to skiers who can get there from the top of Prospect Bowl Lift #12.  A hike of approximately 1/2 hour takes you to these dramatic, lightly trafficked ski runs.  This continues a tradition of amazing  Hike-To  terrain at the resort, adding to its variety of terrain, and further securing Telluride's reputation as a world-class ski resort. 2.




 Revelation Bowl (2008) 



Long a dangerous temptation to gapers because of harrowing cliffs below approximately 1000 vertical feet of above the tree line bowl skiing, the Telluride ski resort is currently installing a fixed grip quad so skiers may enjoy the beautiful terrain without dealing with the cliffs below.

Medium pace bowling is a style of 
bowling in the 
sport of 
cricket.  It can be considered a sub-category of 
fast bowling, if bowling styles are seen as two categories, the other category being 
spin bowling. Practitioners of medium pace bowling are usually known as medium pace bowlers or medium pacers, although sometimes the label used refers to the specific bowling technique the bowler prefers, such as swing bowler or seam bowler.

Many medium pace bowlers are fast bowlers who do not achieve the higher degrees of pace generated by top fast bowlers. Faster medium pacers may be 
categorised as medium-fast or fast-medium depending upon the pace achieved.

Other comments










George Vancouver



June marks the 250th anniversary of the voyages of exploration by the city's namesake. He also explored US and Australia so some international flavour is possible. The article is pretty good. Could use some more on his responsible dealings with First Nations.  21:51, 29 May 2007 (UTC)


Support Moving this forward for June. This is the best month for this article. -- 05:01, 29 June 2007 (UTC)










Vancouver Giants





They hosted and won the Memorial Cup this year and are a good local success story. BUT it needs a lot, a lot of collaboration to make it better.  21:48, 29 May 2007 (UTC)



Oppose - There isn't enough content in that article to make it 'Showcase' worthy. The point of the portal is to direct people to articles of interest. Perhaps we can find a larger article.  19:34, 29 June 2007 (UTC)











Komagata Maru






I tend to agree with Selmo's point below and I'm finding it hard tracking down good quality articles that would make good showcase articles, that have nothing to do with infrastructure. The truth is that the infrastructure articles are in the best shape and any other are biographies of bands or people which would fall under the showcase biography section. I found an interesting article about the 




Komagata Maru



 that is in good shape and has to do with Vancouver History.  05:55, 30 March 2007 (UTC)



Oppose - it's pretty good but could still use some improvement - 21:46, 29 May 2007 (UTC)








Vancouver International Airport



Super comprehensive, well written, and in depth. Its main picture isn't that great, but the ones below are.  03:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)



Oppose We should have fewer infastructure articles.    () 22:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)


Perhaps but for the time being this is my suggestion since it does not appear that any other articles would be 'showcase' ready in 2 days for April.  05:44, 30 March 2007 (UTC)








Gob (band)



Local rock band, they have alot of attention from 99.3 the fox these days. It would be nice to see a musician or band on the portal.    () 03:58, 28 February 2007 (UTC)



Tentative Support   Canucks are a stronger candidate and this article is pretty stubby and uncited. I agree with your reasons, and if we can get it in better shape, I think it'd be a good one for April.  06:53, 1 March 2007 (UTC)


Suggest Move, I think this nomination more suits the Showcase Biography mandate.  05:45, 30 March 2007 (UTC)







Vancouver Canucks


B-class article and a team that everyone knows.  21:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)



Support    () 03:56, 28 February 2007 (UTC)


Support, most Vancouverites love their Canucks.  06:00, 28 February 2007 (UTC)


Support A thing known but practically known by all Vancouverites. Deserves attention.  06:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)


Support  06:53, 1 March 2007 (UTC)


Support - we are all Canucks, so why not our article --  18:25, 27 March 2007 (UTC)







SkyTrain (Vancouver)



I've been working on this article. It's a current GAC, it's well written, has good pictures and its very comprehensive. --  () 02:35, 4 December 2006 (UTC)



 Support This article is very far along and should become a GA article very soon. It would be, like Bobany said, a good article for us to work on to get it up to featured article status. It would not take much.  00:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)


Not sure there's enough reliable sources for it to ever become an FA, but we should always give it a try. --  () 01:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)










Richmond, British Columbia



The article does have quite a few red links, but is relatively well written and its layout is in very good shape. -  23:39, 26 November 2006 (UTC)



Weak support - the refs should use ,  as opposed to using plain external link code. However, this can be easily fixed. --  () 04:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)


This will be the December Showcase Article.  19:37, 2 December 2006 (UTC)


Oppose No disrespect to the editors of that article, but it really needs a good going-over for language and organization. If we spend some time revising it, then it might be a candidate for January '07 - but I honestly don't think it's a  Showcase  article right now. Sorry... -- 07:13, 3 December 2006 (UTC)


The article by no means could be a  but we do have to look at the  with in the  and the 
Portal:Vancouver. The only featured article in our library is 

Vancouver
 and before 
22 November 
2006 was our only GA article. The  has only recently massively increased its efforts to improving its articles. 

Vancouver
 and the 
Vancouver Portal are true examples of this. While the articles in our library still require much work, I am confident we will see greatly improved articles emerging. In the mean time though, we are very limited in our choices, but that still does not mean we shouldn't display the current work we have to show.  00:04, 4 December 2006 (UTC)






Other comments






IMO, the showcase article should be considered differently from a FAC. Obviously, with only one featured article in our canon, we can't apply the same rigourous criteria. Instead, this should be, like the COTM that came before it, something to draw attention to articles that are in good shape so that we can get them in better shape, and eventually into great shape. 22:49, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

Political parties of the Fifth Republic
Liberal parties





The Independent Republican and Liberal Pole (Pole republicain independant et liberal, PRIL) was a 
liberal-
centrist party in 

France
.


It was founded in 1998 by those members of 

Liberal Democracy
, who refused to leave 

UDF
, as proposed by 







Alain Madelin






. They included 
Francois Leotard, 





Gilles de Robien




, 
Gerard Longuet, 
Jean-Pierre Fourcade, 
Alain Lamassoure, 





Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres




, 
Francois Sauvadet, 
Bernard Lehideux and 
Rudy Salles.


PRIL merged, alongside with 

Democratic Force
 (merge of the 
Democratic and Social Centre and of the 

Social Democratic Party
 in 1995) and the so-called  Direct Adherents  to the New UDF, structured as a single party.


Some of them (Jean-Pierre Fourcade, Alain Lamassoure, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres), anyway, joined the 

Union for a Popular Movement
 in 2002, while others, as Gilles de Robien, represent the most pro-UMP and pro-



Sarkozy


 faction within UDF, being also strong opponents of 
Francois Bayrou.

Cypher is a three piece instrumental band from 

Perth
, 

Australia
. 




Music


Cypher have been variously classified as 
Post Rock, 

Space Rock
, 

Noise
 and 

Shoegaze
. Although their music can contain elements of any of these categories, they don't fall into any specific one.


Their sound is often characterised by multiple 





delay




 effects on the guitar, causing a 'wall of sound'. The guitar and bass riffs are often repeated at great length, ebbing and flowing in volume and intensity. The songs can be quite long, sometimes exceeding 15 minutes in length. Live, the band often performs at loud volumes.




Band history


Formed in 1998 as a five piece, the original line-up included Mark Cossom (guitar) and Rob Agostini (vocals). This line-up played several performances and recorded a single in 1998 before Mark and Rob left the band amicably. Their departure caused the style of the music to become focused around longer songs with fewer sections, which gradually built up from quiet beginnings into overpowering crescendos and back down again.


The band (now a three piece) released their debut album Whats a World Without Laughter in 1999. Some songs on the album utilised keyboards, so in order to perform the songs live, the band recruited Karli Rob on keyboards.


An album of remixes and some new material was released in 2000. The band performed a small number of performances before Karli left and was replaced on keyboards by Ian Roberston. More performances followed, included a slot on 





RTRFM




's annual fund raiser 'In the Pines' during which the band were noted for their use of a whipper snipper as an instrument and cooking pancakes onstage for the crowd during their set.


From the end of 2003, the band experienced a hiatus until re-emerging as the current three piece line-up at the end of 2005. An album of previously recorded material Life Changing Sunnies was released in late 2006.

King's College School Wimbledon, or KCS, is one of 











Britain










's leading 









independent








 boys' schools in 

Wimbledon
, south-west 

London
 and is a highly selective and competitive day school for pupils of exceptionally high academic abilities. KCS is a prominent member of the 



Eton Group


, a group of 12 well-known independent schools in the 











United Kingdom










. From September 2010, KCS will be also admitting girls into the 
sixth form for the first time.1


KCS is one of the highest academically performing schools in the UK historically and to this date, coming 2nd in the country's league table of independent schools and having one of the highest 
Oxbridge acceptance rate in the country.2. KCS is one of the world's leading schools for the 
IB Diploma, with 13 pupils obtaining the maximum IB score of 45 points   a score achieved by only 65 pupils worldwide in 2007.3 In 
GCSEs, 34 boys gained 10 or more straight A*s, with 17 of these gaining 11 or more. Overall, 88% of all grades were at A and A* in 2008.4


The 
Good Schools Guide described the school as  an inspiring place to be,  adding,  Boys work and play very hard in this wonderful school community .5


The school was originally founded by 
King George IV as the junior department of 

King's College London
 and occupied part of its premises in 

Strand
, before relocating to Wimbledon in 1897; there is no longer any connection between the institutions, except that one of the Board of Governors is nominated by King's College London. KCS was one of the first schools in the United Kingdom to abolish 
A-Levels in favour of the 
International Baccalaureate, as well as adopt the new 
IGCSE curriculum, both which are the most widely recognized international education curricula.



 History 


A Royal Charter founded the School in 1829 as the junior department of the newly established 
King s College, London. The School occupied the basement of the College in 

The Strand
. Most of its original eighty-five pupils lived in the City within walking distance of the School. During the early 
Victorian Period, the School grew in numbers and reputation. Members of the teaching staff included 










Gabriele Rossetti









, who taught 

Italian
. His son, 



Dante Gabriel


, joined the School in 1837. The best known of the early masters was the water-colourist, 







John Sell Cotman






. Nine of his pupils became practising artists and ten architects. The School was progressive in its curriculum in many areas and appointed its first Science Master in 1855, at a time where very few schools taught science. The first Head Master, John Major, served the School between 1831-1866. Ninety-nine of the School s pupils from this period appear in the 









Dictionary of National Biography








.


Until the 1880s, the School flourished. In 1882, only 

Eton College
 surpassed the total of thirty 

Oxford
 and 

Cambridge
 Board examination certificates obtained by pupils at King's. But the School's teaching facilities were becoming increasingly inadequate as many competitor schools moved to new sites with modern facilities and large playing fields. Falling numbers of pupils prompted the move to the School's present site in 

Wimbledon
 in 1897. Wimbledon was a fast growing suburb and well served by the railway lines from 
Surrey and south London.


In World War I, many letters were written to the school, including some from the Battle of the Somme. During World War II, the school's Great Hall was damaged by bomb shrapnel, and some of the damage can still be seen on the outside of the hall.




 Today 



The school is currently under the headship of Mr. A.D Halls, who succeeded Tony Evans in January 2008. Pupils come to the school from south west London, north Surrey and neighbouring areas. Sixty four per cent of the Year 9 entry consists of boys who continue from the King's College Junior School, thirty four per cent enter from other preparatory schools and about two per cent come from overseas. 


The school consistently achieves exceptional exam results at 
GCSE, 










A-Level









 and the International Baccalaureate. In 2007, KCS began to offer solely the IB in the Sixth Form, following its gradual adoption since 2001.


It is a member of the 
Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, an association of nearly 250 independent British schools, and of the 



Eton Group


 of 12 leading independent schools.


The last headmaster (Mr. A.C Evans) won the best headmaster of a public school category at the annual 










Tatler









 School Awards 2005. Mark Palmer, editor of the Tatler School's Guide, said that he  thought it was about time it was recognised for being an all-round, academically excellent school , he added,  That has a lot to do with the professionalism and integrity of Tony Evans . 
http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4153/is_20051012/ai_n15665884


The Great Hall is a very large building in the Victorian Gothic style. It is used for assembly to hold around 400-500 people. It also enclosed many classrooms and other facilities. It is also sometimes hired out for private functions. The Great Hall was designed by famous architect 










Sir Banister Fletcher









, who co-wrote the book, 'A History of Architecture', and also designed the Gillette factory in Brentford, UK.


KCS came second in the country for 2006 in The Times' rankings for A-Levels, mainly due to the inclusion of its International Baccalaureate results. 
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2328883.html In 2007, it came third in the country in the Times' rankings for A levels, yet again due to its International Baccalaureate. 
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/a_level_gcse_results


In 2007/8, fees for the Senior School were  4,775 per term.6


{




 Houses 



There are 6 houses in the Senior School named after previous headmasters and notable old boys of the school. Boys wear a red and blue school tie until they achieve 6 house points, in which they are awarded a house tie of navy blue with thin stripes of the following colours:





 Alverstone (Green) 


 Glenesk (Blue) 


Kingsley (Purple) 


Layton (Red) 


Maclear (White) 


Major (Yellow)




Other ties include the Prefect's tie (Red with navy blue school crests), the Senior Prefect's tie (Navy blue with red school crests) and School Colours (dark blue with one red school crest).




 King's College Junior School 


King's College Junior School is the preparatory school for 

King's College School
 located in 

Wimbledon, London
. It educates pupils (boys only) from ages 7-13. 
http://www.isinspect.org.uk/report/0581.htm The school operates on the same grounds as the Senior School.


As of the November 2005 
Independent Schools Inspectorate inspection report, enrollment in the junior school totaled 444 boys, divided into six year groups and four classes of about 20 (except in Rushmere (Year 3 and 4) where there are three). The headmaster is Dr G A Silverlock. 
http://www.isbi.com/isbi-viewschool/1042-KINGS_COLLEGE_JUNIOR_SCHOOL.html


The ties are similar to the Senior School ties, but in the top year (Upper Remove) and the end of the previous year (Lower Remove) the headmaster and the teachers choose prefects who get given a Senior School tie. Three headboys are chosen for each Upper Remove year, one for each term, and they are usually prefects.


The uniform is a red blazer with the emblem in blue on the top pocket. Every boy wears a white shirt and grey shorts or trousers. 


The junior school was established in its own right in 1912. While it occupies the same campus as the senior school, they enjoy mostly separate facilities, though conveniently close to share some in common, for example, the dining facility, playing fields, the sports hall, swimming pool, music school and a new art and design technology department. King's College Junior School is also known as KCJS. 


All boys are allocated to one of the school's four houses when they join. Siblings are placed into the same house. Every boy is able to take part in house events that take place through out the school year. At the start of the term, boys will be placed into a house and will consequently remain in there until a move to another school, or KCS (Kings College School).


The houses are as follows:





 Norman (Black)


 Stuart (Green)


 Tudor (Blue)


 Windsor (Yellow)

Roman Catholic dioceses in France




The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cahors, is a 
diocese of the 
Latin Rite of the 
Roman Catholic church, in 

France
. The diocese comprises the whole of the 
department of Lot.

In the beginning it was a 
suffragan of the 
archdiocese of Bourges and later, from 1676 to the time of the 









French Revolution








, of the 
archdiocese of Albi. From 1802 to 1822 Cahors was under the 
Archbishop of Toulouse, and combined the former 
Diocese of Rodez with a great part of the former 
diocese of Vabres and 
diocese of Montauban. However, in 1822 it was restored almost to its pristine limits and again made suffragan to Albi. 



History



According to a tradition connected with the legend of 
St. Martial, this saint, deputed by 
St. Peter, came to Cahors in the first century and there dedicated a church to 
St. Stephen, while his disciple, 
St. Amadour (Amator), the 
Zaccheus of the Gospel and husband of 
St. Veronica, evangelized the diocese. In the seventeenth centuy these traditions were closely examined by the Abbe 
Antoine Raymond de Fouillac, a friend of 
Fenelon, and, according to him, the bones discovered at Rocamadour in 1166, and looked upon as the relics of Zaccheus, were in reality the bones of St. Amator, 
Bishop of Auxerre. 


A legend written about the year 1000 by the monks of 
Saint-Genou Abbey (in the Diocese of Bourges) relates that 
Genitus and his son 
Genulfus were sent to Gaul by 
Pope Sixtus II (257-59), and that Genulfus (Genou) was the first Bishop of Cahors. But 












Louis Duchesne











 repudiated this as legend. 


The first historically known Bishop of Cahors is 
St. Florentius, correspondent of 
St. Paulinus of Nola (end of the fourth century). The Diocese of Cahors counted among its bishops: 






St. Alithus (fifth century); 



St. Maurilio and 
St. Ursinicus (sixth century); 



St. Rusticus, who was assassinated, his brother, 

St. Desiderius
 (Didier), the steward of King 
Dagobert, and 
St. Capuanus (seventh century); 



St. Ambrosius (eighth century); 



St. Gausbert (end of tenth century); 



Guillaume de Cavaillon (1208-34), who took part in the 
Albigensian crusade; 



Hugues Geraud (1312-16), implicated in the conspiracy against John XXII and sentenced to be burned alive; 



Bertrand de Cardaillac (1324-64) and 
Begon de Castelnau (1366-87), both of whom contributed to free 





Quercy




 from English rule; 



Alessandro Farnese (1554-57), nephew of 
Pope Paul III; 


the Venerable 








Alain de Solminihac







 (1636-59), one of the most active reformers of the clergy in the seventeenth century



Louis-Antoine de Noailles (1679-80), subsequently 
Archbishop of Paris. 




The city of Cahors, visited by 
Pope Callistus II (1119-24), was the birthplace of 
Jacques d'Euse (1244-1334), who became pope in 1316 under the title of John XXII, and the tower of whose palace is still to be seen in Cahors. He built a university there, its law faculty being so celebrated as to boast at times of 1200 pupils. Fenelon studied at this institution, which, in 1751, was annexed to the University of Toulouse. In the sixteenth century the Diocese of Cahors was severely tried by religious wars, and the 
Pelegry College, which gratuitously sheltered a certain number of university students, became noted for the way in which these young men defended Cahors against the 
Huguenots. 









Cahors Cathedral





, built at the end of the eleventh and restored in the fourteenth century, has a beautiful Gothic cloister. When, in the Middle Ages, the bishops officiated in this church they had the privilege, as barons and counts of Cahors, of depositing their sword and armour on the altar. In the diocese special homage is paid to 










St. Sacerdos









, 
Bishop of Limoges, and his mother, Mundana (seventh century); 
Esperie (Speria), virgin and martyr (eighth century); 
St. Geraud, Count of Aurillac (beginning of the eleventh century); Blessed Christopher, companion of 
St. Francis of Assisi and founder of a Franciscan convent at Cahors in 1216, and Blessed 

Jean-Gabriel Perboyre
, born in the village of 
Mongesty, 1802, and martyred in China, 1840. 


The city of 





Figeac




 owed its origin to a Benedictine abbey founded by 

Pepin
] in 755. The principal places of pilgrimage are: Notre-Dame de Rocamadour, visited by St. Louis (1245), Charles the Fair (1324), and Louis XI (1463), its bell being said to have rung miraculously several times to announce the deliverance of shipwrecked sufferers who had commended themselves to the Blessed Virgin; Notre-Dame de Felines and Notre-Dame de Verdale, both dating back to the eleventh century; Saint-Hilaire Lalbenque, where some highly-prized relics of St. 

Benedict Joseph Labre
 are preserved.

Scottish weights and measures
Obsolete units of measure
Units of volume




In 

Scotland
, the firlot was a 
dry measure used until the introduction of 
Imperial units by the 
Weights and Measures Act 1824. 

By an 
Act of the Scottish Parliament of 1617, the commissioners' firlot of 

Linlithgow
 was made the standard for the whole of Scotland, but in fact two units were defined for different commodities.


The first, which  contained 21 pints and a 
mutchkin of the water of [the river] 

Leith
,  (approximately 36 litres) was for 
wheat, 
pease, beans, 
rye and white salt, commodities which had been sold by striken, or level measure.


The second firlot, which contained 31 pints of water, was for 
oats, 
barley and 
malt, which had been sold by heaped measure.  The pint mentioned is the Scottish Sterling jug.


A firlot was equal to 4 
pecks, and the 
boll was equal to 4 firlots.

One of the varied, large historic homes of Olde Towne East



Olde Towne East is a multi-cultural neighborhood located in the historical 
Near East Side of 

Columbus, Ohio
. It is one of Columbus' oldest neighborhoods. Nestled between Downtown, 

Bexley
, 





Old Oaks Historic District




 and 





Driving Park




. The area has over 1,000 homes, some as old as the 1830s, and more than 50 architectural styles including 
Italianate, 


Queen Anne

 and 


Victorian

.


These homes were built by many of the famous individuals of Columbus including industrialists, lawyers, judges, teachers, architects, mayors, governors, and legislators, many of whom shaped Columbus.

 History of Olde Towne East 



Olde Towne East was a 
bedroom community during the 19th century and 20th century. One of the very first suburban areas in Columbus, Ohio which was made possible by the installation of the city s first horse drawn streetcars starting in 1863. Olde Towne East, as it is called now, was annexed into the city of Columbus by 1870. It had previously been an area of family operated farms and countryside stretching along the 








National Road







 (
Broad Street) from Washington D.C. In 1882, trolley tracks were laid on Oak Street to Kelton Ave where the streetcar barn still stands, providing convenient transportation to former location of the Ohio State Fairgrounds, (now Franklin Park Conservatory and Gardens), and to downtown Columbus. By 1886, large sections of the area had been subdivided into residential lots. These new homes were built for many affluent politicians, businessmen, industrialists, architects, and land speculators who would shape the future of the city of Columbus. There were also no de facto religious restrictions against Jewish and Catholic families that were common in some other developing neighborhoods.


Some of the best known residents included: 



James Thurber


 (Cartoonist and Humorist), 
H.S. Hallwood (inventor of paving blocks), the Hoster family (beer brewers), 
John Jay Barber (Artist), 
Joseph Yost (Architect, designer of the Governor s Mansion and Broad Street Presbyterian Church among many other buildings in the area, see figures 21   22), 
William Fisher (Writer and Humorist), the Lazarus family (retailers, founders of the Lazarus Department Store progenitor of 

Macy's
), 












Alice Schille











 (painter), and the Governors of the State of Ohio from 1920 to 1957. 
In 1896, E.T. Paul opened his blacksmith s shop at 115 Parsons Ave, next to his buggy shop. Today, E.T. Paul and Sons Co. is the oldest independent tire dealership in the U.S. Olde Towne East was once known as the  Silk Stocking District  in reference to the expensive clothing of its wealthy residents. The city s most intelligent/shrewd, creative/artful, wealthy/decadent, powerful/demure, and honorable/notorious citizens all resided in this neighborhood.


The proliferation of the automobile and the rise of an economic middle class marked the beginning of an evolution of Olde Towne. Columbus saw the creation of another ring of suburbs starting in the 1920s. To the immediate east of Olde Towne is the City of Bexley, which quickly began to absorb Olde Towne s affluent residents. It was a classic conflict of  old money  versus  new money . After World War II the transformation was unstoppable. Gone were the wealthy urban residents of Olde Towne East who had either died, moved into more distant suburbs. The once grand and opulent mansions were either gutted of their expensive amenities such as, copper plumbing and porcelain sinks and bathtubs or partitioned and converted into apartments and nursing homes. The Broad Street Boulevard a long strip of landscaped median that extended through the neighborhood from the state capitol to Franklin Park was removed to make room for more car traffic lanes and the zoning was changed for commercial offices. The Interstate Highway System introduced in the late 1950 s was also a cause of the decline (see figure 23). 

Interstate 71
 physically divided the neighborhood from its city center and created an inner city  island . The so-called  
white flight  had begun with the introduction of the freeway system, more suburbs, and desegregation. The neighborhood became by the 1970s a predominately African-American community. They had not been included in the prosperity of the 1950s and earlier. Olde Towne East still provided easy access to jobs and necessities by foot or public transportation, and the many large old homes and apartments were much more affordable compared to the new suburbs. The area s buildings and the original residents still mostly owned homes however, the lack of home ownership has been suggested as a factor for the economic decline that followed.


Revitalization is now underway. These structures are being restored to the grand homes they once were. Originally costing perhaps $6000 to construct during the 19th and early 20th century. In April 2000 the highest sales price was $350,000. If an Olde Towne East home was constructed today the cost would be astronomical, and practically impossible to build due to the now rare fine craftsmanship of the era and expensive materials used.




 Architecture and Historical Preservation 



Olde Towne East saw many of Columbus  finest homes built within the area and much of that architectural legacy still exists today. There are more than a thousand uniquely styled homes in the Olde Towne area, some built as early as 1830, representing over 50 unique architectural styles. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Olde Towne East represented some of the most popular American building styles spanning 100 years, which included: 
Federal, 
Italianate, 


Victorian

, 


Queen Anne

, 
Gothic Revival, 
Tudor, 
Colonial Revival, 


American Foursquare

, and 







American Craftsman






. All of these classic styles have been well presented in the area by local architects and craftsmen. Characteristics of the homes of Olde Towne often include art glass windows, hand carved woodwork, parquetry, stone details, ornate tile work, natural slate and tile roofs, artful wrought iron fencing, and elaborate brick and stone exteriors all created with the abundant resources that were available in the local area 100 years ago.


Bricks, tiles, glass, and iron were all produced in southeastern and northeastern Ohio and made available through the extensive canal systems and later railroads of the day. The dense native forests provided the white oak, walnut, maple, and gum woods commonly used throughout these homes. Features of the home s designs often include: formal parlors, libraries, multiple dining rooms some seating up to 30 guests, ballrooms, large attics, expansive porches, elegantly tiled bathrooms, gas fireplaces, and wine cellars. In addition, carriage houses for the larger than most contemporary homes are commonplace and most homes often include quarters for houseservants.


Historical preservation in Olde Towne East is an important aspect of the community today. Many  present day suburban neighborhoods such as 

Dublin, Ohio
 do not employ the unique construction techniques as used in the former era gone by. In 1989, the Bryden Road Historic District was created within the City of Columbus  Department of Development. The city s Historic Resource Commission according to the recommendations of the Ohio Historic Society now governs alterations to these structures. Today s residents are fostering a rebirth, wholly restoring, renovating and preserving the original character of the houses while creating a unique urban community.


The Olde Towne East Neighborhood Association (OTENA) was founded in 1975 as a non-profit organization to promote civic pride and cultural awareness. OTENA now plays an active role in neighborhood zoning and development issues, and strives to help create a community that values its historic structures. Started in 1982 and presented by OTENA, the Olde Towne Tour of Homes was intended to introduce area homeowners and to exchange ideas and expertise. In 1985, the Holiday Tour was created to present the contemporary traditions of residents including Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa. Today, the tours continue to highlight renovations in progress, showcase period restorations, and present modern day necessities in an historic setting. One of the tours biggest objectives is to inform people from other parts of the Columbus area of the historic value of existing structures and to welcome them to experience the community that an urban environment can create. Many of the visitors continue to be from the families who originally lived in the area.




 Land Use Changes Over Time 



The land use in Olde Towne East has changed many times in its existence, from its beginning when it was an affluent neighborhood to its decline and now again to its rebirth. Olde Towne East was once a suburb of Columbus and now is encompassed by Columbus, with more than a thousand homes in the area and numerous architectural styles. The diversity in Olde Towne East is unlike any other from the various architectural styles to the various people and social classes.  To the north end of the community lies a congregation of housing projects along the Mount Vernon and Champion avenue corridors.




 A Neighborhood of Choice   Change 



At the beginning of this century, people chose to live in Olde Towne East for social status. Today, the residents choose to live there for the unique styling of the houses and their appreciation for the diverse community. The varied cultural and racial backgrounds, and economic levels that are present create a unique environment not found in any other Columbus neighborhood. Olde Towne East is a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood in a 
grid layout. The Columbus Metropolitan Library, The Columbus Museum of Art, Franklin University, Capitol University Law School, and Columbus College of Art and Design, all within a 15 minute walk. The entire downtown of Columbus is easily accessible by bicycle or public bus. City, county, state and federal government agencies, including the Capitol Buildings of the State of Ohio, several regional and national banks, insurance companies, and major corporate headquarters are all accessible without the use of an automobile. There is convenient access to all other areas of the city by the freeway and bus systems that converge downtown. Beginning as the home of the city s elite and currently home to a diverse urban community, Olde Towne East has seen many changes.

Corpus hemorrhagicum

c_56




The corpus hemorrhagicum ( bloody body ) is a temporary structure formed immediately after 
ovulation from the 
ovarian follicle. After the trauma heals, the subsequent structure is called the 
corpus luteum (which in turn becomes the 
corpus albicans before degenerating.)

Mike Windischmann




Mike Windischmann (born 

Nuremberg
, 

Germany
) is a retired U.S. 
soccer 
defender who played in both the 

Major Indoor Soccer League
 and the 




American Soccer League



.  He earned fifty 
caps with the 

U.S. national team
 and was the captain of the U.S. team at the 

1990 FIFA World Cup
.  He is a member of the 









National Soccer Hall of Fame








.


Early life and youth career


Although born in Germany, Windischmann's family moved to the United States when he was an infant.  He attended 

Thomas Edison High School
 in 

New York City
.  He began playing soccer when he was six years old and developed as a player, not in the school system, but playing for local New York City clubs.  These included Blau-Weiss Gottschee, S.C. Gjoa and Queens United.


In 1985, Windischmann played for the U.S. at the 

U-16 World Cup
.  That year he also played for the U.S. at the 1985 
World University Games.  Two years later, in 1987, he again played at the World University Games.  That year, he was also on the U.S. team at the 





1987 Pan American Games




.  The U.S. went 1-1-1 and did not make the second round.




Professional career


After graduating from 

Adelphi University

http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/adel/sports/m-soccer/auto_pdf/Honorsandawards.pdf in 1986, Windischmann chose an alternate career from most of his peers.  At the time, the 

Major Indoor Soccer League
 (MISL) was the destination of choice for collegiate soccer players.  Windischmann decided instead to play for the Brooklyn Italians of 




New York City's Cosmpolitan League



.  He played two seasons with the Italians before joining the 



Los Angeles Lazers


 of MISL. His single season with the Lazers ran the 1988 to 1989 season when the team folded at the end of the season.  Windischmann then moved to the 









Albany Capitals








 of the 




American Soccer League



 for another single season.  At the end of the 1990 season, Windischmann retired from professional soccer.




National Team


By 1988, Windischmann was no stranger to the national team program, having gone to the U-16 World Cup, two World University Games and the Pan American Games.  He had also earned his first 
cap with the senior national team in 1984.  However, the three years of 1988 to 1990 saw his international career reach its height.  It began with the 
1988 Summer Olympics where Windischmann was a member of the 

U.S. team
.  Windischmann considers one of his all time career highlights, scoring a goal in a 1-1 tie with 

Argentina
.  Despite this excellent result, the U.S. finished the first round at 1-1-1 and did not qualify for the second round.


Despite this disappointment, Windischmann saw more personal success the next year when he was chosen as the 1989 
U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year.  He was also named as the captain for the 

1990 FIFA World Cup
 qualification games.  While 1990 saw the end of his professional playing career, it also saw Windischmann's greatest achievement when he captained the U.S. team at the 

1990 FIFA World Cup
.  This was the first time the U.S. had made it to the World Cup since 1950.  By the time Windischmann retired in 1990, he held the national-team record for the most consecutive games played (36) and started (33).


Windischmann also played for the U.S. at the 1989 and 1992 
FIFA Futsal World Championship which finished third and second respectively.  He earned 24 
caps and scored 4 goals for the U.S 
futsal team between 1986 and 1992.  


In 1986, Adelphi University inducted Windischmann into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame.


In 2004, he was elected to the 









National Soccer Hall of Fame








.


He currently teaches and coaches at the Susan B. Anthony Academy, New York.  He is also the technical director of the Brooklyn Knights, which plays in New York's Cosmopolitan Junior Soccer League.

Compositions by Pyotr Tchaikovsky
Compositions for string quartet




The String Quartet No. 3 in E-Flat Minor, Op. 30, by 
Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, was composed in 
1876, and is the last of his three 
String Quartets. It was written as a memorial for 











Ferdinand Laub










. 1 (The date upon the manuscript is early February 1876. 2)

The quartet was performed for the first time at a party at 
Nikolai Rubinstein's apartment on 
March 2.  The first public performance was at a concert on 
30 March (new style/
March 18 (old style), 
1876, the performers being: Jan Hrimaly 1 and 







Adolph Brodsky






, violins; Yuly Gerber, cello; and 














Wilhelm Fitzenhagen













, cello. 


Once, while Tchaikovsky was staying with some friends, they surprised him by bringing in a String Quartet who performed this quartet for him. When they finished playing, Tchaikovsky remarked,  At first I didn't much like the Finale, but now I see that it is quite good. 



 Structure 


The work is in four movements and is approximately 37 minutes long.





 Andante Sostenuto - Allegro moderato


 Allegretto vivo e scherzando


 Andante funebre e doloroso, ma con moto


 Finale: Allegro non troppo e risoluto.




The Andante Funebre was originally intended to be the second movement, with the Allegretto vivo e scherzando as the third, but Tchaikovsky later decided to switch them.

Fungi of Australia

Fungi of Australia




Compared with many other nations and continents, the knowledge of the fungal flora of Australia is meagre. Unlike many countries with centuries of accumulated knowledge both cultural and later scientific, Australia has lacked input on both. Little is known of aboriginal use of fungi apart from a few species such as Blackfellow's bread (




Laccocephalum mylittae



), and research by botanists and mycologists since 1788 has been spasmodic and intermittent. Indeed some states currently lack mycologists in their respective herbaria. 

Australia is estimated to have about 250,000 fungal species, including about 5000 
mushrooms, of which roughly 5% have been described.1 Knowledge of distribution, substrates and habitats is poor for most species, with the exception of common plant pathogens.2 



Introduced fungi


With the notable exception of the gigantic 
Phlebopus marginatus, possibly Australia's largest mushroom, many of the most conspicuous fungi are those which have been introduced in association with exotic soil and trees; 
Lactarius deliciosus, 




Chalciporus piperatus



, 




Suillus luteus



 and 




Suillus granulatus



 are European fungi which may be found in pine plantations in Eastern Australia. The deadly 




Amanita phalloides



 is found under 
Oak in urban 

Canberra
 and 

Melbourne
 and has caused deaths. There are concerns at least one of them, 




Amanita muscaria



 is spreading into (and forming new 
mycorrhizal associations with) native 
Nothofagus woodland and possibly displacing local species.3 Lawns, farms and parklands see exotic fungi such as the shaggy ink cap (







Coprinus comatus






), the poisonous 




Chlorophyllum molybdites



 and several species of 
Agaricus, including the edible 




A. bisporus



 and 




A. campestris



 as well as mildly poisonous 




A. xanthodermus



. 


Mycorrhiza of 
Rhizopogon luteolus was deliberately introduced to improve the performance of pines in pine plantations in 




Western Australia



 in the early part of the 20th century.4


Another introduced fungus is 












Phytophthora cinnamomi











, known as Dieback or Rootrot from the common names of the disease in Western Australian bush flora and garden plants respectively. Large swathes of bushland have been affected right across the country with many flora, principally members of the 
Proteaceae and 
Myrtaceae affected.


The stinkhorn-like species 
Aseroe rubra is significant in that it is the first fungus species known to have been introduced in the other direction, namely Europe, from Australia. It was recorded growing on soil transported from Australia in a glasshouse in 
Kew Gardens in 1829.5




Native fungi





An 
Amanita, taken at 
Barrington Topsmost likely 
A. punctata but possibly 
A. vaginata.



On the whole, native fungi are very poorly known, with most taxa undescribed. For those that have been, there are huge gaps in knowledge, especially with respect to distribution and edibility. Reasons for this include the brief and unpredictable appearance of fruiting bodies, often the only evidence of  most species, and the fact that there has been comparatively little scientific attention focussed upon fungi in Australia.6


There are several exceptions; one is the family 
Hygrophoraceae which has been the subject of a treatment by mycologist 







A. M. (Tony) Young






 in 2005.7 Another is a treatment of the genus 
Mycena in Southeastern Australia.8 The genus 
Amanita has been the subject of two reviews but a microscope is still needed to distinguish many species and coverage has concentrated in Australia's eastern regions.910 







Alec Wood






 has also published a study of the genus 




Galerina



, describing 29 species, 21 of them new, primarily in New South Wales.11 A more usual state of affairs is that reported by 
Roy Watling with regard to 
boletes, that it Australia appears to be rich in species yet only a minority are described.12


The 
CSIRO have published three volumes on the bibliography of all Australian fungal species described; Volume 2A, published in 1997, and Volume 2B, published in 2003.1314 Unlike the 






Flora of Australia





 series they are bibliographic lists and do not contain species descriptions.




History


Early collections in Western Australia were made by 






James Drummond





 and 

Ludwig Preiss
 in the early to mid-19th Century. They sent their specimens to 

W. J. Hooker
 at 
Kew and 


Elias Magnus Fries

 respectively.

















John Burton Cleland













 conducted the first systematic review of Australian fungi in a landmark monograph of fungal specimens at the South Australian Herbarium. Comprising some 16000 specimens, this included fungi from elsewhere in the country as well as South Australia. He was assisted by such people as 
Edwin Cheel, keeper of the Herbarium at the 









Royal Botanic Gardens








 in Sydney, 






Leonard Rodway





 of Tasmania and 
Phyllis Clarke (later North), who provided some watercolour paintings. These three were honoured with at least one specific epithet of new species described by Cleland.4 This resulted in two comprehensive volumes (1934-35) on the larger fungi of South Australia, and was reprinted in 1976. These were reworked and published recently in 1997 by contemporary 
mycologist 
Cheryl Grgurinovic, though funding only allowed the publication of a volume on larger fungi.










Bruce Fuhrer






 and Tony Young, whose book was first published in 1982 and has been revised several times since, have been instrumental in promoting Australian fungi to the general public with popular books on fungi in Australia.1516 Published knowledge is augmented by locally produced guides in Western Australia,17 Queensland and Tasmania.18

Streets in Adelaide




Pulteney Street is a main road in the eastern sector of the 
central business district (CBD) of 

Adelaide
1, 
South Australia. It runs north-south, from 





North Terrace




 to 
South Terrace, where it becomes Unley Road.

Pulteney Street was named, at the behest of 

















Governor Hindmarsh
















, after Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm, who had recommended Hindmarsh be appointed Governor of South Australia. 
http://www.historysouthaustralia.net/STlist5.htm#pul The southern portion of Pulteney Street, between 
Wakefield Street and South Terrace, was originally named Hanson Street, after 













Richard Davies Hanson












 (later Sir Richard), a London solicitor and journalist, and founding member of the South Australian Literary Society in August 1834. In 1846, nearly a decade after the naming, Hanson moved to South Australia, where he served as Premier (1857-1860), as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (from 1861) and as acting Governor (1872-1873). Hanson Street was subsumed into the expanded Pulteney Street in August 1967. The Hanson Street Memorial in Hurtle Square maintains the commemoration of Sir Richard.


Pulteney Street passes through two of the five squares in the Adelaide CBD: 















Hindmarsh Square














 and 










Hurtle Square









.

The Shaughraun is a 
melodramatic 






play





 written by 


Irish

 
playwright 









Dion Boucicault








.  It was first performed at Wallack's Theatre, 

New York
, on 
14 November 
1874.1 Boucicault played Con in the original production. The play was a huge success, making half a million dollars for Boucicault, which he squandered.


Plot



The play is about a 






Fenian





 
fugitive, Robert Ffolliott, fiancee of Arte O'Neil. A country 
squire, Kinchela, his rival for Arte's hand, tries to hunt Robert down and arrest him, with the help of a police informer, Harvey Duff. Robert escapes various melodramatic 
cliffhanger situations with the help of Con the Shaughran (

Irish
 seachranai = wanderer, errant person), a roguish 
stage Irish poacher who provides a great deal of 
comic relief. 


Robert's sister, Claire Ffolliot, is in love with an 



English


 
soldier, 
Captain Molineaux, who is tracking down Fenians in the area. She cannot decide whether or not to protect her brother or betray the Captain. However, Molineaux's 
fish out of water attitudes to 
rural 

Ireland
 provide comic relief, and all ends well. The Fenians receive a general 
amnesty, the couples marry, Kinchela is arrested, and Harvey Duff falls off a 
cliff.

Herman Van Breda



Herman Leo Van Breda (born Leo Marie Karel) (
28 February, 
1911, 

Lier
, 

Belgium
   
4 March, 
1974, 

Leuven
) was a 
Franciscan, philosopher and founder of the Husserl archives at the 




Higher Institute of Philosophy



 of the 






Catholic University of Leuven





 in Belgium.

On 
19 August 
1934, he was ordained as a priest and in 1936 he started studying 
philosophy at the Catholic University of Leuven, where he obtained a 


PhD

 degree in 1941 with a dissertation on the 
phenomenology of 


Edmund Husserl

. Later he became a professor at the Catholic University of Leuven, where he stayed until his death in 1974. 



Husserl Archives


Van Breda saved the extensive writings and manuscripts of 


Edmund Husserl

 from destruction by the 
Nazis.


For the preparation of his PhD thesis he traveled to 
Freiburg, 

Germany
 in 1938, where he found, in the legacy of Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), more than 40000 

Gabelsberger
 
stenography manuscripts and his complete research library. The political situation in 

Germany
 at that time convinced him of the necessity to transport these manuscripts and Husserl s private library to 

Leuven
. In order to smuggle the documents out of 
Nazi Germany, he needed the support not only of the rector of the Catholic University of Leuven, but also of the Belgian government. The Belgian Prime Minister at that time, 

Paul-Henri Spaak
, allowed van Breda to bring the documents from Freiburg to the Belgian embassy in Berlin and diplomatic couriers to bring them to Leuven in Belgium.


Van Breda also was able to convince Husserl's former assistants, 

Eugen Fink
 and 
Ludwig Landgrebe, to collaborate on the editing of these documents in Leuven. At the beginning of 







World War II






 the documents were being kept in the university library in Leuven, which burned to ashes on 
17 May 
1940. Fortunately, one week before the fire Van Breda decided to bring the documents to the Higher Institute of Philosophy. 


In 1943 the documents were, for safety, distributed over different locations in Leuven, including a shelter in the cellar of the Institute of Philosophy and the 









Abbey of Postel








. After the war they were brought back to the Institute of Philosophy, where they form the basis for the 






Husserliana





, the complete works of Edmund Husserl.


For his work on spreading Husserl s work he was awarded a 
honoris causa doctorate from the 
Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg.

Kirkham






Kirkham Grammar School is an 
independent school in 

Kirkham, Lancashire
, 

England
 (






grid reference





 
SD415320). It was founded in 1549. Its roots can be traced back to the chantry school attached to 

St Michael's Church, Kirkham
 in the 13th century.  The school remained in the church grounds until it moved to occupy its present site on Ribby Road in 1911. The front range of the school and the headmaster's house constitute a Grade II 
listed building.1



School history



In 1585 the Thirty Men of Kirkham, a group which administered parish business, took control of the school. It appears that they did not always perform their duties particularly well, for, by the early part of the seventeenth century, the school had fallen into disrepair and had been without a master for seven years. Isabell Birley, a humble alehouse keeper, came to the rescue in 1621, presenting the Thirty Men of Kirkham with  30 in her apron for the restoration of the school. 


In 1655 Henry Colburn, an 
old boy of the school, left money and land to the school in his will, putting it in the trust of the 


Worshipful Company of Drapers

 in London. Then began a long partnership between the Company and the School, which has continued to the present day, though the Drapers surrendered control of the school in 1944, having endowed it with large and impressive extensions in 1938. 


The present school building was built between 1909 and 1911 when the front range and the headmaster's house were constructed to a design by the architect F. H. Greenaway of London.1  Independent status ceased temporarily in 1944 when the school became a 





voluntary-aided




 boys  
grammar school. A further major extension, the Norwood Science Building was opened in 1965 and subsequently extended. In 1979 the Board of Governors took the decision to revert to independent status and Kirkham Grammar School became a 
co-educational school for the first time. 


The last decade of the twentieth century witnessed a remarkable growth in the school s popularity and standing, exhibited by a rise in pupil numbers from 500 to 900 and a programme of continuous development. The school s partnership with 

BAE Systems
, first established in 1994, became a major driving force behind its success.


The school has applied to host a Pre-Games Olympic Training Camp before the 
2012 Summer Olympics, which are to be held in 

London
.




School Crest

The grant of armorial bearings was bestowed on Kirkham Grammar School in the late 1920 s in recognition of the honour due to one of Lancashire s most historic foundations. The design of its coat of arms expresses the true meaning and purpose of the school. 


On the shield are the doves of Kirkham township, together with the triple coronets of the 


Worshipful Company of Drapers

, symbolic in turn of the ties which bind the school and town together and of the benefactors who, from its early days, have watched over the interests of the school. The crest also contains a windmill resting on a book, an emblem of scholarship deriving its inspiration from the old industrious spirit of the Fylde. The School s old motto,  Ingredere Ut Proficias , literally translated means  Enter in order to profit .




Development


The school is with the full support of its Governing Body continuing its intensive development programme. The school celebrated its 450th anniversary in 1999 and has undertaken a major development programme with phase one, a science laboratories and classroom project, being completed in November 2005.2 The second phase, a new  1.5M extension project, was launched in May 2007 to give the school extra facilities with twelve new classrooms.3 The classrooms, with full 
Information technology (IT) 
multimedia teaching aids and access to 
laptops with 
wireless 
Internet facilities, opened in December. A 
time capsule was buried in the foundations.2


In January 2007, the new Lawrence House Pavilion was officially opened with a performance of 





William Shakespeare




's 

Much Ado About Nothing
. The pavilion houses a drama studio, changing rooms, kitchen and a lounge area Funded by the Lawrence House Trust, together with the Katie Caine Trust, after which the studio was named and also The Friends of Kirkham Grammar, the pavilion cost  220,000.4 


In October 2007 the school's sports pitch was relaid with all weather 

AstroTurf
, and with floodlights it is also used by local community partners for sports such as 
hockey and 
football. The old pitch was recycled with part of it being used to make new pathways for North Shore Golf Club in

A historical overview of the family from the pre-British days is available in KKN Kurup (ed.)  Koodali Grantavari  published by the Department of History, University of Calicut.


Among the illustrious members of the family are KT Kunhikammaran Nambiar, a member of the Madras Legislative Council and KT Kunhiraman Nambiar, volunteer of Indian National Congress and participant in 
Salt Satyagraha in Malabar, and later president of Kerala

The Stronger Spell



English






 The Stronger Spell  is a 
fantasy story written by 



L. Sprague de Camp


 as part of his 






Pusadian series





. It was first published in the magazine 










Fantasy Fiction









 for November 1953, and first appeared in book form in de Camp's collection 
The Tritonian Ring and Other Pusadian Tales (
Twayne, 1953). It has since been reprinted in the anthology 
The Mighty Barbarians, edited by 
Han Stefan Santesson (
Lancer Books, 1969). It has also been translated into 

Dutch
 and 

German
.



Plot summary



After musical performer Suar Peial rescues the druid Gleokh from a murderous affray, the two celebrate the latter s deliverance in a local tavern. Gleokh holds forth on his revolutionary new weapon, an experimental gun. A general debate over the gun and its merits, and the threat it might pose to the bronze age culture in which the characters live. Midawan, an armorer, is worried it will render his profession obsolete, while the Semkaf, a wizard from Typhon, is overcome by greed for the device. His apprentice attempts to kill Gleokh for it, only to be shot by the gun, whereupon Semkaf conjures up an invisible serpent to finish the job his servant started. Suar and Midawan are literally caught in the crossfire, and it falls to the armorer to save them both 


Chronologically,  The Stronger Spell  has no settled place in the chronology of de Camp's Pusadian tales. Critic 







John Boardman






 placed it last in the series on the grounds that the handgun represents a technological advance over weaponry seen in the other stories. De Camp himself had no fixed position in mind for the story.




Setting


In common with the other Pusadian tales,  The Stronger Spell  takes place in a prehistoric era during which a magic-based 










Atlantian









 civilization supposedly throve in what was then a single continent comprised of 
Eurasia joined with 






Africa





, and in the islands to the west. It is similar in conception to 


Robert E. Howard

's 



Hyborian Age


, by which it was inspired, but more astutely constructed, utilizing actual 
Ice Age geography in preference to a wholly invented one. In de Camp's scheme, the legend of this culture that came down to classic 

Greece
 as  Atlantis  was a garbled memory that conflated the mighty Tartessian Empire with the island continent of Pusad and the actual Atlantis, a barbaric mountainous region that is today the 




Atlas mountain range



.

Do Right Woman is an album by 

Barbara Dickson
.

Barbara Dickson's first two solo albums were on 
Decca. They won critical praise but poor sales. They show the repertoire that she had at that time as a singer in folk clubs. In 1973 her career took a very different course when accepted an offer to sing on the London 





West End




 stage. She then sang 
torch songs and 
power ballads. Do Right Woman was obviously recorded on a low budget. The first track,  Easy to be Hard  is from the musical 
Hair, almost a preminition of her future career on stage. In 1969 Barbara had been a backing singer on a recording by 
Rab Noakes. On Do Right Woman she returns the favour by singing one of his songs,  Turn a Deaf Ear . The first traditional song on the album is  The Garton Mother's Lullaby , which was re-recorded in 2005 on  Full Circle . On  Returning  she sings the last verse in French.


Running time: 34 minutes 47 seconds. Recorded 1970. Issued on vinyl in 1970. Re-released in 2006 packaged on a single CD with  From The Beggar's Mantle...

Swedish motorcycle Grand Prix




The 1989 Swedish motorcycle Grand Prix was the thirteenth round of the 
1989 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season. It took place on the weekend of 
11th-
13th August, 
1989 at the 










Anderstorp









 circuit.


500 cc race report




Wayne Rainey
 takes pole, then it s 

Kevin Schwantz
 and 





Eddie Lawson




. Rainey gets the start, and Lawson moves into second, followed by Schwantz.


A lead group forms, with Rainey, a small gap to Lawson, then another small gap to Schwantz, 

Kevin Magee
 and 





Christian Sarron




.


Schwantz cruises into the pits with a mechanical, and Lawson closes the gap to Rainey and moves into the lead. Sarron is in third a couple of bike lengths behind, and 





Wayne Gardner




 passes Magee for fourth spot.


With two laps to go, Rainey is right behind Lawson and highsides on the exit of a right-hander. It's a long tumble, but he gets up and doesn t try to pick up the bike. Though it s Rainey s only real mistake all year, Lawson s consistency and improvement brings him the win and a lead in the standings by 13.5 points. Sarron takes second, Gardner third.


Says Lawson of the lap that saw Rainey go down:  That was my fastest lap of the race; I'd never got on the throttle that early all race. When I cracked it open, Wayne followed me, and there was no way the Dunlop was going to do that. It wasn t Wayne, it was the tyres. 1

Driving
Trucks








Towing is the process of pulling or drawing behind a chain, line, bar or some other form of coupling.  Commonly, towing is done by road vehicles, but anything from boats to tractors to people can tow cargo.



 Types of trailers 





Main article: 
Trailer (vehicle)

Almost any 
SUV, 
van, 
minivan, 
pickup truck, 
garden tractor or 
passenger car can be equipped to tow a trailer properly when given the correct equipment.


Most trailers can fall into one of four categories:



Flat bed or open trailers are platforms with no sides or stakes. This type of trailer works well for hauling large or unconventional shaped objects.


Enclosed trailers are fully covered by four sides and a roof.  These types of trailers are generally used for carrying 
livestock since they protect the contents from weather.  People also rent these types of trailers for moving boxes, furniture and other materials.


Boat trailers are used specifically for pulling boats.  These types of trailers are designed for easy loading in and out of the water and are purchased based on the specific type and style of boat they will be hauling.



Recreational vehicles (RV) are 
utility vehicles or vans that are often equipped with living facilities.  These types of trailers can be attached to the back of most any road vehicle and are commonly used for camping outings or road trips.






 Towing safety 



There are many safety considerations to properly towing a caravan or 
trailer (vehicle) / 
travel trailer starting with vehicle towing capacity and ranging through equalizer hitches to properly and legally connecting the safety chains.


According to the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Association, more than 65,000 crashes involving passenger vehicles towing trailers occurred in 2004 in the US, jumping nearly 20 percent from the previous year.  


In 2006, 





Master Lock




 did their annual study on towing safety to see how many Americans tow their cargo correctly.  The study,  Towing Troubles,  included responses from trailer owners across the country and found that while the majority of trailer owners believe they know what they re doing when it comes to towing, most were lacking the proper education.  Master Lock reported that 70 percent of trailer owners did not fully know the correct way to tow their cargo.


An important factor in towing safety is tongue weight, the weight with which the trailer presses down on the tow vehicle's hitch. Insufficient tongue weight can cause the trailer to sway back and forth when towed. Too much tongue weight can cause problems with the tow vehicle.1




Towing capacity



Towing capacity is a measure describing the upper limit to the weight of a trailer a vehicle can 
tow.  In the United States, towing capacity is expressed in pounds, while many other express in kilograms.


Some countries demand that 
trucks and 
buses have the maximum trailer weight and eventually maximum trailer length signed close to the coupling device, while this is rare with smaller cars or 
pickup trucks.

 Types of towing hitches 





Main article: 






Tow hitch







A tow hitch, tow bar or recovery point is a device attached to the 
chassis of a vehicle for 
towing.


It can take the form of a tow-ball to allow swivelling and articulation of a trailer, or a tow 
pin and 
jaw with a trailer loop - often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows the same movements. A further category is the towing pintle used for military vehicles around the world with a hook and locking catch.

Lasse-Maja



Lars Larsson Molin, alias Lasse-Maja (
October 5 
1785 - 
June 4 
1845), was a notorious 







Swedish






 criminal who used to disguise himself in women's clothing, which gave him the female sounding nickname Lasse-Maja; Lasse is the common version of his own male name Lars, and Maja was a common version of the female name Maria. His nickname was a way of describing his ambiguous gender as well as the method he used in his criminal career.  

Lasse-Maja quickly became a notorious thief, stealing especially from rich people, his speciality being to dress in women's clothing so as to catch his victims off-guard, sometimes flirting with the men, and to aid his escapes from the crime scenes.  The disguise was not used solely for professional reasons; he was also said to have been comfortable in women's clothes. 


They are many stories about him; he is mentioned in memoirs and diaries, appears as a character in novels and films, and is undoubtedly the most famous 
transvestite in Swedish history - he became almost an icon, and is much romanticised. 


He was caught in 1813 after having stolen silver from the church in 
Jarfalla and sentenced to life imprisonment in the fort of Karlsten in 

Marstrand
, but he behaved in an exemplary manner as a prisoner and soon his time in jail became quite comfortable; he became a tourist attraction for the upper-classes, who visited Marstrand for relaxation during the summer season, and became a social success. One of these visitors was the crown-prince, the future king 
Carl XIV of Sweden, who had him pardoned and released in 1839. 


Lasse-Maja spent the rest of his life touring the country, talking about his exciting life. He is said to have claimed that life was very hard, but that the most important thing was to have fun.

Sierra Leone
) is a Sierra Leonean international 
goalkeeper. Sesay plays for 


Ports Authority

 in the 






Sierra Leone National Premier League





.


Profile



Brima Sesay was born in Kenema, Sierra Leone to 





Temne




 parents. Although born in Kenema, Brima Sesay moved to the capital city of Freetown at a young age. Small Attouga , as he is commonly called, was recruited into active 
football by his late boss 
Brima Attouga Kamara, a former goalkeeper for 

Sierra Leone national football team
. Having been initiated into active football, small attouga made a name for himself while playing in a series of junior league competitions played all over 

Freetown
. He won several best goalkeeper awards with youth clubs like Blackhall Strikers, Junior Cenegal, and Best Contractors.
In 1992, Brima Attouga Kamara brought him to 


Ports Authority

 youth team.


In 1996, he was promoted from the 
youth  team, to the senior squad. However, his tiny physical appearance did no good during that time to convince his coach to become the club first choice 
goalkeeper. 


In 1997, small attouga was outstanding in goal in an international friendly against a top 

Liberia
n side 


Invincible Eleven

. His performance in that match was enough to prove to his critics that he indeed deserved to be the club first choice goalkeeper. And from that time, he has excelled as Ports Authority first choice goalkeeper, and as well as one of the best goalkeepers in Sierra Leone. He made his senior debut for Sierra Leone in 2000.

. Other names: Lytene, Myza Lytene 1 Population - (?). 
Notable buildings - Litene Manor 2.
Litene became a known symbol in the summer of 1941, the  year of terror  of the 
Soviet occupation. For it was Litene where most Latvian officers were arrested. Part of them were shot on the
spot, the others were deported to Siberia where nearly all of them died.


 History 


Army camp Litene is one of the places where Latvian army personnel were arrested and killed by the 
NKVD after occupation of Latvia by Soviet Union.34 


In the spring of 1941, units of the Latvian Army 24th Territorial Corps were sent for summer training to the former Latvian Army base at Litene 5. On 14 June 1941, the remaining officers, while on an alleged training mission, were disarmed, arrested and deported to 










Norilsk









, north of the 




Arctic Circle



 in 
Siberia, where they were sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment.


During the commemoration ceremonies on 14 June 2001 at Litene fraternal cemetery Latvian Defence Minister 
Girts Valdis Kristovskis unveiled a memorial to Latvian army officers killed in 1941.6


In 1990, excavation was undertaken at the former Latvian Army summer camp in Litene, where in June 1941 officers of the former army of the Republic of Latvia (which by then became the 24th Territorial Corps) were arrested and killed. The excavators uncovered the remains of 11 individuals, evidently officers of the 24th Territorial Corps3.

Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19, also known as CCL19, is a human 
gene.1


This gene is one of several CC cytokine genes clustered on the p-arm of chromosome 9. Cytokines are a family of secreted proteins involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes. The CC cytokines are proteins characterized by two adjacent cysteines. The cytokine encoded by this gene may play a role in normal lymphocyte recirculation and homing. It also plays an important role in trafficking of T cells in thymus, and in T cell and B cell migration to secondary lymphoid organs. It specifically binds to chemokine receptor CCR7.1


Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19) is a small 
cytokine belonging to the CC 
chemokine family that is also known as EBI1 ligand chemokine (ELC) and macrophage inflammatory protein-3-beta (MIP-3-beta). CCL19 is expressed abundantly in 
thymus and 
lymph nodes, with moderate levels in 

trachea
 and 

colon
 and low levels in stomach, 
small intestine, 
lung, 
kidney and 
spleen.2 The gene for CCL19 is located on human 
chromosome 9.3 This chemokine elicits its effects on its target cells by binding to the chemokine receptor 
chemokine receptor 




CCR7



.2 It attracts certain cells of the 
immune system, including 
dendritic cells and antigen-engaged 






B cell





s,45 
CCR7+ effector-memory T-Cells.6

The Yap football team is the official football team representing the island of 
Yap, one of the four 

Federated States of Micronesia
. It is not affiliated with 

FIFA
 or 
OFC. But the Yap football team plays matches against other 




Micronesia



n national teams, some being full-

Asian Football Confederation
-members like 

Guam national football team
 and some being associate member of the 

Oceania Football Confederation
 like 

Palau national football team
. 


The Yap football team contested the 

Federated States of Micronesia national football team
 on August 16, 2002 in the village of 





Dinay




, belonging to the municipality 
Rull on the island of Yap. This was the last match played by Yap so far. The 

Federated States of Micronesia national football team
, in action since 1999, can be viewed as successor of Yap.


They mainly play international matches in 
Micronesia Games.


Since 
31 July, 
2007 Yap is provisional member of 
NF-Board, which organizes matches for non-official national teams.

Kimby Caplan (March 12th, 1974, Phoenix, Arizona) is an American filmmaker who brought the question of what it means to be 
deaf in the 21st century to national attention.


Early life



Caplan was born in 

Phoenix, Arizona
.  In 1975 the Caplan family moved to 

Denver, Colorado
.  Shortly after the move, Kimby's paternal grandmother visited and discerned that the thirteen month old baby was deaf.  Fortuitously, Porter Memorial Hospital in Denver was home to one of the most progressive audio-verbal clinics in North America.  The clinic, which was spearheaded by Doreen Pollack, was at the forefront of putting hearing aids on babies and young children.


Beginning in the late 1940s, 
audiology and the study of hearing loss became a field of study, in response to the number of servicemen returning from 
WWII with hearing loss.  This field rapidly escalated in terms of hearing aid development for adults.  However, at this time Doreen Pollack (and those with whom she worked) were pioneers in placing 
hearing aids on babies and young children; with the hope that there was some residual hearing that could be developed.  Pollack believed strongly in encouraging hearing parents to give their children a chance to utilize whatever hearing might remain.  Pollack worked extensively with Kimby and her parents from 1975-1979 to help her develop her residual hearing and subsequent language.  In 1979 Kimby's parents divorced and Kimby moved with her mother to 

Angel Fire, New Mexico
. During the next ten years she made yearly visits to Colorado to be assessed by Pollack, who encouraged her continued speech development.


While in New Mexico, Kimby's mother worked on various Indian reservations as a part-time pharmacist, with Kimby in tow.  Home was an army pup tent located halfway between Angel Fire and Eagle Nest.  Kimby was at times in school and otherwise, 
homeschooled.  The remainder of her time was spent skiing at the local Angel Fire and Taos ski resorts.  This partly nomadic and unusual lifestyle, did much to influence the creative perspective that is often evident in Kimby's filmmaking.




College/Graduate School



Kimby attended the 

University of Colorado at Boulder
 where she was exposed to the experimental and personal filmmaking of Stacy Steers, Patti Bruck, Stan Brakhage, and Phil Solomon. She went on to make four experimental short films, three of which received a Goldfarb award which is the highest honor possible as determined by faculty. One of these tied for a Golden Glove (best student film as determined by the student body).  This is a record as yet unbroken; and these four films (alongside two others) now reside in a permanent collection, in the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' Film Archive at the Mary Pickford Center in Los Angeles, California.


After graduating with a BFA in 1999, Kimby moved to 

Park City, Utah
, where she volunteered at the 











Sundance Film Festival










 and worked as a ski instructor at Deer Valley Ski Resort.  After several years of being inspired by the film scene at Sundance, Kimby enrolled in the Cinema-Television program at Southern Methodist University in 
Dallas, Texas.  For her master's project at Southern Methodist University she made the documentary film, LISTEN.  LISTEN chronicled, on a personal level, the journey her parents took with Doreen Pollack (an audio-verbal therapist to the profoundly deaf). LISTEN went on to win a first place at an Academy accredited festival, The Black Maria, and received a 2005 Student Academy Award (Bronze medal in the documentary category). Excerpts have aired on ABC, NBC, and PBS; in addition to touring the country and showing at museums and universities across the country.  Most remarkably,the film was at the crest of a wave of public interest in the world of the Deaf and the hearing impaired.  This interest has led to increased information and media attention to cochlear implant technology, and the Deaf Pride that is now most evident at 

Gallaudet University
 (the nation's premiere university for the culturally deaf) in 
Washington, DC.


Currently [] Kimby Caplan is attending the 



American Film Institute


 in 
Los Angeles, specializing in 
cinematography. She continues to work on experimental films, documentaries and narratives that she feels will contribute in positive ways to the advancement of those who are marginalized.




Trivia



Kimby Caplan is one of the first, if not the first deaf individual, to make a personal documentary on the experience of being profoundly deaf.

Marnix Gijsen



Marnix Gijsen 
20 October 
1899 -  
29 September, 
1984) was a 

Flemish
 writer. His real name was Jan-Albert, Baron Goris, his pseudonym relates to 
Marnix van Sint Aldegonde and the surname of his mother (Gijsen).


Early years


Gijsen was born in 1899 in 

Antwerp
, 

Belgium
. In his youth he received a strictly 
Roman Catholic education, at the 
Jesuit college of 


Saint Ignacio

 in Antwerp, but in 1917 he was punished heavily (consilium abeundi, E: 'advice to leave') for his militant Flemish 
activism during 

World War I
. In 1925 he went to the 






Catholic University of Leuven





, where he obtained a PhD in history and moral sciences with a dissertation on Etudes sur les colonies marchandes meridionales (portugaises, espagnoles, italiennes) a Anvers de 1488 a 1567. He went on to study at the 

University of Freiburg
, 

Paris
 (


Sorbonne

) and 

London
 (

London School of Economics
).




Career


From 1928 until 1933, he was a civil servant at the municipal authorities of Antwerp, including principal private secretary of the mayor of Antwerp (1928-1932). Subsequently he worked at the civil service in 

Brussels
 from 1932 to 1939, where he was Chief of Cabinet of the Minister of Economics from 1932 until 1937, and from 1939 up to 1941 he was Commissioner-General for tourism.


From 1942 until 1964, he lived in 





New York




 (








United States







) as Belgian commissioner for information and in addition he was plenipotentiary minister. On the Belgian public radio, as The voice from America, he had a weekly radio spot on Saturday night.




Literary career





Belgian writers Marnix Gijsen, 










Suzanne Lilar









, 
Francoise Mallet-Joris, and the future queen Paola in the 1960'



Marnix Gijsen started his literary career as a poet within the 
expressionist group Ruimte (E: Space) their illustrated magazine. His most important poem was Lof-litanie van de Heilige Franciscus van Assisie (E: Praise of Saint Francis) (1920). In his early period he came into contact with the 

Flemish
 poets 









Paul van Ostaijen








, 
Karel van den Oever, and 
Victor J. Brunclair. After a study trip to the United States, he wrote the story Ontdek Amerika (E: Discover America) (1927). He wrote essays on art, such as on 

Karel van Mander
 (1922), 
Jozef Cantre, (1933), and 
Hans Memlinc (1939), and he wrote daily literary criticisms. He was a close friend of the Belgian writer 










Suzanne Lilar









, and he wrote the afterword in the 1976 Dutch translation of Lilar's  Le Couple  (1963).


During 







World War II






, he broke with his 
Roman catholic faith, and adopted moral values and an attitude of life based on 
stoicism. This became apparent in his first novel Het boek van Joachim van Babylon (E: The book of Joachim van Babylon), which was first published in 1947. From then on, he published a series of novels, such as Goed en kwaad (E: Good and bad) (1951), Klaaglied om Agnes (E: Mourning for Agnes) (1951), De diaspora (1961), Zelfportret, gevleid natuurlijk (E: Self-portrait, flattered of course) (1965). In 1968, he wrote 
theatre play, Helena op Itahaka. On his relation to 
Catholicism, he wrote De afvallige (E: The renegade) and Biecht van een heiden (E: Confession of a heathen), which were both published in 1971. 


His literary work is a testimony of a moralist, who, in spite of everything, goes his own way and holds high the moral values of good and courage against evil. His literary work was awarded the Belgian national prize for literature in 1959, and 1969 and the 



Prijs der Nederlandse Letteren


 in 1974. In 1975, he was knighted and became a Baron.


Gijsen died in 

Lubbeek
, Belgium in 1984.

1990 deaths
1909 births
Witnesses to the John F. Kennedy assassination
People from Carter County, Oklahoma




Marie M. Muchmore (
5 August 
1909, 

Ardmore, Oklahoma
   
26 April 
1990, 
Dallas, Texas)1 was one of the witnesses to the 











assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy










 in 
Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. A color 



8 mm film


 that Muchmore photographed is one of the primary documents of the Kennedy assassination. The Muchmore film, with other 8 mm films taken by 








Abraham Zapruder







 and 








Orville Nix







, was used by the 









Warren Commission








 to investigate the assassination and to position the presidential limousine in a 
forensic recreation of the event in May 1964.2

Muchmore was born Marie Mobley in 

Ardmore, Oklahoma
. Her mother was half 

Chickasaw
 Indian.3 One of her sisters, Aurelia, became a noted operatic 
soprano under the name Lushanya Mobley (1906 1990).4 Marie had no children.


Muchmore was an employee of Justin McCarty dress manufacturers in Dallas (707 Young Street which was four blocks south of the 



Texas School Book Depository


), and was in 









Dealey Plaza








 with five other employees, including Wilma Bond, who had a still camera. She set up her 8 mm 
Keystone movie camera near the northwest corner of Main Street and Houston Street and awaited the president s arrival. The Muchmore film consists of seven sequences: six before the assassination, and one during the shooting. Muchmore began filming the presidential motorcade with her movie camera near the northwest corner of Main Street and Houston Street as the motorcade turned into Dealey Plaza. She then turned and went a few yards west to photograph the President's limousine as it went down Elm Street. After the car turned on Elm Street, the three gunshots were heard. Her film captures the fatal head shot, seen from about 135 feet (41 m) away.5 The film ends seconds later as 

Secret Service
 agent 









Clint Hill








 runs to board the limousine. 


Muchmore sold the undeveloped film to the Dallas office of 
United Press International on November 25, 1963 for $1,000. It was processed by 

Kodak
 in Dallas, and flown to 

New York City
. It appeared the following day on local television station 






WNEW-TV





.6 The film now belongs to the 
Associated Press Television News, which restored it in 2002.7


While visiting her family in Oklahoma for 
Thanksgiving, Muchmore told them about the film she had taken of the assassination; her family then told the 
FBI about the film. The FBI initially interviewed Muchmore in December 1963, during which she admitted she had a camera with her but denied that she took any pictures of the assassination scene.8 The FBI was unaware of the film's existence until a frame enlargement was published in the UPI book Four Days: The Historical Record of the Death of President Kennedy in January 1964.9 A subsequent 
FBI interview in February 1964 says:


Mrs. Muchmore stated that after the car turned on Elm Street from Houston Street, she heard a loud noise which at first she thought was a firecracker but then with the crowd of people running in all directions and hearing the two further noises, sounding like gunfire, she advised that she began to run to find a place to hide.10

In 
1858, Snider-Pellegrini made these two maps.  They depict his interpretation of how the American and African continents may once have fit together before subsequently becoming separated.


 

Antonio Snider-Pellegrini (1802-1885) was a 

French
 
geographer and scientist who theorized about the possibility of 
continental drift, anticipating 


Wegener's

 theories concerning 
Pangaea by several decades.  


In 1858, Snider-Pellegrini published in 

Paris
 his book, La Creation et ses mysteres devoiles ( Creation and its Mysteries Unveiled ).  He proposed that all of the 
continents were once connected together during the 
Pennsylvanian Period.  He based this theory on the fact that he had found 
plant fossils in both 
Europe and the 








United States







 that were identical.  


Snider-Pellegrini also believed that it was the 
Great Flood of the 
Bible that had caused the fragmentation of the 
supercontinent.

Allen Memorial Art Museum





The Allen Memorial Art Museum (abbreviated 'AMAM') is located in 

Oberlin, Ohio
 and is run by 

Oberlin College
.  Founded in 1917, its collection is one of the finest of any college or university museum in the United States, consistently ranking among those of 
Harvard and 
Yale.1


The AMAM is primarily a teaching museum, and it is a vital cultural resource for the students, faculty, and staff of Oberlin College as well as the surrounding community. Notable strengths include seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish art, nineteenth and early twentieth-century European and contemporary American art, and Asian, European, and American works on paper. The collection is housed in an impressive Italian Renaissance-style building designed by 








Cass Gilbert







 and named after its founder, Dr. Dudley Peter Allen (B.A., 1875), a distinguished graduate and trustee of Oberlin College. 


The AMAM is also known for its art rental program which enables 

Oberlin College
 students to rent works of art by notable artists such as 
Renoir, 
Picasso, and 
Dali for five dollars a semester.


In 1977, 













Robert Venturi












 designed an addition that represents one of the earliest and finest examples of 
postmodern architecture in the United States.



Collections



The Allen Memorial Art Museum has an outstanding collection of more than 12,000 objects   including paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, prints, drawings and photographs   that provide a comprehensive overview of the history of art from a variety of cultures.  The collection is particularly strong in European and American paintings and sculpture from the 15th century to today, and has important holdings of Asian paintings, scrolls, sculpture and decorative art, including a large group of 



Ukiyo-e


 prints.  High-quality 
African, 
Pre-Columbian, and 
Ancient Art is also represented.  The museum also houses the 










Eva Hesse









 archives, which includes the artist s notebooks, diaries, photographs and letters, and is proud to oversee, along with the Art Department, 

Frank Lloyd Wright
 s 
Weltzheimer/Johnson House.

The Enraged Will Inherit The Earth(1989)




McCarthy







Banking, Violence And The Inner Life Today was the third and final album by the band 


McCarthy

. It was released in April 1990.


The final album by 


McCarthy

 sees no letup in the search for the perfect pop tune. 








Tim Gane







 begins to display the hypnotic layering that would become his trademark in 


Stereolab

. However, Banking... is still characterized by jangly guitars and up-tempo pop drumming. 
Malcolm Eden's nasal vocals are backed by 
Laetitia Sadier, future 


Stereolab

 singer. This album displays some of the most adept left-wing lyrics on offer.


Never a band to indulge in political airheadedness, on  Use a Bank I'd Rather Die  McCarthy pours scorn on hippie 
idealism, whereas new age beliefs are rounded upon in  The Well-Fed Point of View . The attitude so prevalent in the 


Margaret Thatcher

/



Ronald Reagan


 era is solidly attacked on  And Tomorrow the Stock Exchange Will Be the Human Race . Always keen to court controversy, support for the 

Provisional Irish Republican Army
 is espoused on  Take the Shortest Way With the Men of Violence .

The Gospel According to Jesus Christ


1991



Portuguese









The Gospel According to Jesus Christ (original title: O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo) is a novel by the 
Portuguese author 
Jose Saramago. It is deemed to be very controversial, being censored in the author's native Portugal,1 and also drawing criticism from the 
Roman Catholic church, who accused Saramago of possessing a  substantially anti-religious vision .2



Plot introduction


This book re-imagines the life of 
Jesus Christ, using the events depicted in the 
canonical gospels as a scaffold on which to build its story. It more or less follows the 






chronology of the life of Jesus Christ





, however much greater emphasis is spent on the earlier part of Jesus' life than in the canonical gospels. 





Plot summary



The book describes a fictional alternate history to the life of Jesus Christ as depicted in the 
Bible. It begins with Jesus's conception, in the spiritual presence of God. Jesus's birth is heralded by a mysterious character, who claims to be an angel. Later, at 










Bethlehem









, Jesus is born in a cave3, and three shepherds - including the  angel  - arrive to bring him presents.


As described in the 










Gospel of Matthew









, 

Herod the Great
 receives a premonition of the birth of the  
King of the Jews  (in the Gospel, he is informed by the 
Magi; in the book, however, he is visited in his dreams by the prophet 





Micah




). He orders the 
Massacre of the Innocents. Jesus survives, but his father, 

Joseph
, who has learnt of the plan, neglects to warn the other families in the village, ensuring that his son is safe first and is plagued by nightmares for the rest of his life.


Later, when Jesus turns thirteen, Joseph is crucified by the Romans who mistakenly think him to be a 
Zealot fighter. From the night of his father's death, Jesus inherits his nightmare. He learns about the massacre from his mother, and grows aloof from his family, amongst whom he can no longer live peacefully. He leaves the family and Nazareth and makes his way to Jerusalem, where he 


















visits the Temple

















, thence to Bethlehem.


He works as an apprentice to a shepherd (called The Shepherd who is understood to be the 
Devil and the mysterious  angel  mentioned earlier).  The Shepherd instructs Jesus in the ways of 
hedonism, and at one point tries to convince Jesus to use the sheep for sexual release. Eventually, he meets 
God in the desert. God forces Jesus to sacrifice his favourite sheep, and says he has a design for him. Upon hearing of this, the Shepherd tells him to leave immediately. Jesus makes his way back home through the 

Sea of Galilee
 where he discovers an amazing talent to catch myriads of fish, and 





Magdala




 where he meets and falls in love with 

Mary Magdalene
, then continues back home to Nazareth.


Jesus is not believed by his family, and so he leaves them once again, marries Mary Magdalene and goes to work helping the fishermen on the 

Sea of Galilee
. One day out on the Sea by himself, he is visited by God and the Devil. God tells Jesus of his plan for Jesus to institute 


Christianity

, because God is annoyed at being only the God of one race, and that other Gods seem to get all the glory. Jesus is initially against what he sees as a selfish plan bound to lead to great suffering of many, but is made to see that he actually has no choice in the matter, because God is, in fact, God.


Jesus becomes a prophet of God, continuing to work miracles but also preaching. He gets himself arrested, and, in a move to undermine God's plan, seeks to shatter his own credibility by claiming to be God's Son and immortal. However, it is God's power to make these things be true, which He does. The novel ends with Jesus' realization that God's plan of instituting Christianity will succeed despite him.

Eastside, Flint

Flint, Michigan




Eastside, sometimes known as the State Streets, is a large neighborhood in Flint, Michigan.  It is not to be confused with 
East Flint in which it resides.  The neighborhood is bounded on the west by 
University Park and 





Buick City




, the north by the 
Northeast Side, the east by 
Thrift City, and the south by 
East Village1.  The neighborhood is anchored on the north and south by two large parks, 
Whaley and 
Kearsley, and is also the site of Washington and Williams Elementary Schools, and formerly Homedale Elementary.



57-Acre Kearsley Park anchors the southern boundary of Flint's Eastside, and it is considered to be Flint's  showpiece  park.  In recent years, the park has been completely renovated.





 Location 



The most commonly given boundaries, established by the Olde Eastside Neighbors2, are the 
Flint River to the west, 

Dort Highway
 to the east, 
Whaley Park to the north, and 
Robert T. Longway to the south.   State Streets  is drawn from the name of twenty streets that bisect the center of the neighborhood from north to south.




 History 



Since 1904, the 
Eastside has been located adjacent to General Motors North Flint facilities, including Buick City.  While subdivisions such as 
Civic Park and 
The East Village were originally designed as  bedroom neighborhoods  at some distance from the factories, the Eastside was built as a lower-income community from the beginning.  This is demonstrated by the housing stock which consists almost strictly of wood-frame bungalows.  Additionally, the neighborhood has been isolated from the rest of the city by the Flint River and, later, 
I-475 and Delphi East.  Even in Flint's halcyon decades of the 1940s and 1950s, the Eastside was not considered a prosperous neighborhood.


Problems magnified with the deindustrialization of General Motors beginning in the early 1980s.  The Eastside did not suffer from the rapid white-flight experienced across the river.  At the same time a large portion of the original population was displaced by southern migrants, and the neighborhood has gradually diversified.  




 Present day 



While the Eastside is unquestionably Flint's most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhood3, it has been continually plagued by gang-related violence and racial tension.  Today, the Eastside is one of Flint's most troubled neighborhoods in terms of violent crime.  Due in large part to these problems, and the affordability of housing stock, the Eastside is one of the few neighborhoods in Flint where the majority of residents are not landowners.  Mass property acquisitions have led to the concentration of residences in the hands of a few landlords.  This, combined with infrastructural degradation and the decline of Flint as a whole, have reduced property values to new lows.


There are some assets in the Eastside working against these prevailing trends.  In particular, Kearsley Park has been recently redesigned and renovated, and has become a stablizing influence on the neighborhood.  The diversity of the Eastside, essentially unprecedented in Flint, has had its most visible impact on Davison Road, as seen by such businesses as Luigi's Restaurant and the Flint Judo Club.  Other well-known local institutions, such as Angelo's Coney Island Restaurant and the Brown Funeral Home have been located on the Eastside for decades.  Public school students in this area generally attend 

Flint Central High School
.

Broadback River





The Broadback River (

French
: Riviere Broadback) is a 
river in northern 

Quebec
, 

Canada
. It drains into 
Rupert Bay (a smaller bay at the south end of 
James Bay), just south of the 



Rupert River


 and 

Cree
 
community 
Waskaganish.


The Broadback, together with the 



Nottaway


 and Rupert Rivers, was initially considered to be dammed and diverted as part of the 




James Bay Project



. But in 
1972 
hydro-electric development began on the more northerly 



La Grande


 and 



Eastmain River


s, and the NBR Project was shelved. With the decision to divert the Rupert River to the La Grande, it is not likely that the Broadback will be developed in the foreseeable future.


River is a popular 
canoe-tripping destination1.

London Buses route 156 is a 

Transport for London
 contracted bus route in 

London
, 











United Kingdom










. The service is currently contracted to 



Travel London


.



History


The 156 began on the 23rd April 1983, the route served between 

Morden
 Station and 
Clapham Junction (Grant Road), the route was introduced as a replacement for sections of the 77A and M1 which were withdrawn at the same time. The 156 was operated at 
Merton Garage (AL) and it was operated by 






DMS





. The PVR was Monday to Saturday 12DMS and Sunday 6DMS. In October 1984 after 7:45pm the 156 terminated at Northcote instead of Grant Road, the PVR also changed in this year Monday to Friday 9DMS, Saturday 11DMS and Sunday stayed the same at 6DMS. 


By August 1985, the 156 was extended from 
Clapham Junction to 

Vauxhall
 (Monday- Friday Peaks only). The Monday to Friday PVR was increased to 18DMS, Saturday and Sunday was unchanged. 2 years later in July 1987, the Monday to Saturday service between 

Raynes Park
 to 

Morden
 was withdrawn and replaced by a new route (163). The route was Monday to Saturday Rayners Park to 
Clapham Junction. Monday to Friday Peaks 

Raynes Park
 to 

Vauxhall
 Station. Sunday journeys ran between Morden to 
Clapham Junction. Monday to Saturday allocation was transferred to 

Stockwell
 Garage (SW). The PVR changed again, Monday to Friday 16DMS, other days were not changed. 


Two years on, the AL Sunday service was transferred to SW so the 156 was operated daily from 

Stockwell
 Garage, the Peak Vehicle Requirement for Monday to Friday was decreased by 1 bus to make it 15DMS. By March 1991 the Sunday operation at AL was transferred back, but the Monday to Friday service was still at SW, they also started to introduce 





Metrobuses




 on the 156. The PVR was currently Monday to Friday 11DMS/M, Saturday 10DMS/M and Sunday 6DMS/M. 2 months later in May the allocation was back at AL full time, and was operated by DR's. It was withdrawn between Clapham Junction and Vauxhall, also between 

Wimbledon
 and 

Morden
. So the 156 only operated from 
Clapham Junction to 

Wimbledon
. The PVR was now Monday to Saturday 9DR and Sunday 7DR. 


In 1994 AL allocated a Metrobus to the 156 for school journeys, also MRLs started appearing on the 156 with the DRs still operating. By 1996 the Metrobus was still going on the 156 but the DR buses were withdrawn so it was only operated by MRLs. 


When late 1997 came the contract was reassigned to Limebourne, it was being operated by 

Battersea
 Garage QB and the double decker school journey was being operated by Nostalgia Bus. The PVR was now Monday to Saturday 8SD, and Sunday 5SD, also 1 double decker Monday to Friday. In April 1999 the school journey double decker was transferred to Limebourne. Later on in 2001 Limebourne were taken over by 
Connex this was still operated at QB and a lot of the buses from Limebourne were now with Connex. The PVR was now 8DCL Monday to Saturday, Sunday 6DCL. A year later Connex converted the 156 to double deck which was being operated by Trident/Alexander's (TA's). The PVR was now increased 13TA Monday to Friday, Saturday 12TA and Sunday 10TA, from the end of 2002 the route was extended from 
Clapham Junction to 

Vauxhall
. 


During 2004 



Travel London


 took over 
Connex and they used the same garage and buses (TA's). The PVR is currently 13TA Monday to Friday, 12TA Saturday and 8TA Sunday's. The average journey time is between 35 and 65 minutes. The frequency for Monday to Saturday is every 10 minutes, Sunday and evenings are between every 15-20 minutes.

History of Poland
Country name etymology
Polish language







An 18th century  labeled  Poland 



The 
ethnonyms for the 
Poles (people) 1, and 

Poland
 (their country) 2 include 
endonyms (the way Polish people refer to themselves and their country) and 
exonyms (the way other peoples refer to the Poles and their country). Endonyms and most exonyms for Poles and Poland derive from the name of the 


West Slavic

 tribe of 

Polans
 (Polanie), while in some languages the exonyms for Poland derive from the name of another tribe   the 


Lendians

 (L dzianie).


 Endonyms 


The 

Polish
 words for a Pole are Polak (masculine) and Polka (feminine), Polacy being the plural form. The adjective  Polish  translates to Polish as polski (masculine), polska (feminine) and polskie (neuter). The common Polish name for 

Poland
 is Polska. The latter Polish word is an adjectival form which has developed into a substantive 
noun, most probably originating in the phrase polska ziemia, meaning  Polish land .3 The full official name of the Polish state is Rzeczpospolita Polska which loosely translates as  Polish Republic  (see 
Rzeczpospolita for details). 


All of the above names derive from the name of the Polans, one of the strongest of the tribes inhabitating the territories of present-day Poland in the 9th-10th centuries. The origin of the name Polanie itself is uncertain. It may derive from such Polish words as pole ( field )
, opole ( group of villages belonging to one clan , an early administrative unit) or plemi  ( tribe ).


Polska was initially a name used by the Polans to describe their own tribal territory in the 
Warta River basin. During the 10th century, the Polans managed to subdue and unite the Slavic tribes between the rivers 
Oder and 

Western Bug
 into a single 
feudal state and in the early 11th century, the name Polska was extended to the entire ethnically Polish territory. The lands originally inhabitated by the Polans became known as Staropolska, or  Old Poland , and later as Wielkopolska, or  


Greater Poland

 , while the lands conquered towards the end of the 10th century, home of the 

Vistulans
 (Wi lanie) and the 


Lendians

, became known as Ma opolska, or  


Lesser Poland

 . 


In Polish literature, Poland is sometimes referred to as 
Lechia, derived from 
Lech, the legendary 
founder of Poland.


In the 17th-18th ceturies, Sarmaci ( Sarmatians ) was a popular name by which Polish nobles referred to themselves (see 



Sarmatism


).




 Exonyms 

 
Variations of the country endonym Polska became exonyms in other languages. Exonyms for Poland in other 

Slavic languages
 bear particular resemblance to the Polish endonym (

Kashubian
 Polsko; 

Czech
 Polsko; 

Slovak
 Po sko; 

Croatian
, 

Serbian
, 
Slovenian Poljska; 

Belarusian
        , Pol'shcha; 

Russian
       , Pol'sha, 

Bulgarian
      , Polsha). In 

Latin
, which was the principal written language of the 
Middle Ages, the exonym for Poland became Polonia. It later became the basis for Poland's name in all 

Romance
 (

Italian
, 

Romanian
, 

Spanish
 Polonia; 

Catalan
 Polonia; 

Portuguese
 Polonia; 

French
 Pologne) and many other languages (e.g. 

Albanian
 Polonia; 

Greek
        , Pol nia). 

Germans
, Poland's western neighbors, called it Polen from which exonyms for Poland in other 

Germanic
 (

Dutch
, 

Danish
, 

Swedish
, 

Norwegian
 Polen; English Poland; 

Icelandic
, 

Faroese
 Polland; 

Yiddish
     , Poyln) and other languages (e.g. 

Arabic
       , Bolanda; 

Hebrew
      , Polin; 

Indonesian
 Polandia; 

Irish
 An Pholainn; 

Japanese
      , P rando) are derived.


There is, however, a group of languages, where the exonym for Poland derives from the name of 


Lendians

, a proto-Polish tribe that lived around the confluence of rivers 
Vistula and 



San


, in what is now south-eastern Poland. Their name derived probably from the Proto-Polish word l da, or  scorched land .3 Not surprisingly, this kind of exonyms are used primarily by the peoples who lived east or south of Poland. Among those exonyms are: 



     (lyakh) used in 

East Slavic languages
. The historical region of Poland on the 

Belarus
ian border known as 


Podlachia

 (Polish Podlasie) derives its name from that East Slavic exonym. Today, Lachy S deckie is a name of a small ethnic group around 
Nowy S cz in southern Lesser Poland. In Polish literature, the word Lachy is used by East Slavic characters as synonyms for  Poles  and  Poland .




Lithuanian
 Lenkija''




Hungarian
 Lengyelorszag 




Turkish
 Lehistan (now considered obsolete and replaced by Polonya).4 The latter became the basis for Poland exonyms in a number of other 



Middle East


ern languages, including: 

Kurdish
        , Lohestan; 

Armenian
         , Lehastan; 

Persian
, 

Tajik
       , Lahestan. 




In some languages the Polish endonym Polak became an 
ethnic slur used to describe a Pole. Examples include English 
Polack (pronounced 
Polock and formerly a neutral term5, for example in 
Hamlet's references to  the Polack wars ) and French polaque. In other languages this is the neutral word for Polish or a Pole (e.g. Swedish polack, Italian polacco, Portuguese and Spanish polaco). In Russian and 

Ukrainian
 the old exonym     (lyakh) is now considered offensive6 and is replaced by the neutral       (polyak), although the latter's 
diminutive form,         (polyachyok) is pejorative as well.




 Related words 


Some common English words, as well as scientific nomenclature, derive from Poland exonyms in various languages.



 
Alla polacca, like a polonaise (in musical notation); Italian for  Polish style 


 
Polonaise, a dance of Polish origin; from French polonaise, or  Polish  (feminine)


 

1112 Polonia

The Camunni  or ancient Camuns (

Greek
:          for 








Strabo







 or            for 








Cassius Dio







) were an 
Alpine people who inhabited the valley of the Ollius (modern 
Oglio), from the central chain of the 
Rhaetian Alps to the head of the Lacus Sebinus (modern 
Lago d'Iseo). This valley, which is still called the 



Val Camonica


, is one of the most extensive on the 



Italian


 side of the 
Alps, being over 100 
km in length. The actual inhabitants of 



Val Camonica


 are called Camuns (Italian: Camuni).


According to 





















Pliny




















, the Camunni were a 


Euganean

 tribe, while 








Strabo







 reckons them among the 





Rhaetians




.


The name of the Camunni appears among the Alpine tribes who were reduced to subjection by 

Roman
 emperor 


Augustus

, after which the inhabitants of all these valleys were attached, as dependents, to the neighbouring towns of 
Gallia Transpadana ( finitimis attributi municipiis , Plin. iii. 20. s. 24; Strab. iv. p. 206; Dion Cass. liv. 20). At a later period, however, the Camunni, appear to have formed a separate community of their own, and we find mention in inscriptions of the  Res Publica Camunnorum . (Orell. Inscr. 652, 3789.) 


In the later division of the provinces, they came to be included in Regio X Venetia et Histria.

 Johannes Kepler (1571   1630) was a 
German 
Lutheran 
mathematician, 
astronomer and 
astrologer, and a key figure in the 17th century astronomical revolution. He is best known for his 
laws of planetary motion, based on his works 






Astronomia nova





 and 
Harmonice Mundi; Kepler's laws provided one of the foundations of 


Isaac Newton

's theory of 
universal gravitation.  Before Kepler, planets' paths were computed by combinations of the circular motions of the 
celestial orbs; after Kepler astronomers shifted their attention from orbs to 
orbits paths that could be represented mathematically as an 
ellipse.

During his career Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a Graz seminary school (later the 

University of Graz
, 

Austria
), an assistant to 

Tycho Brahe
, court mathematician to 
Emperor Rudolf II, mathematics teacher in 

Linz
, 

Austria
, and adviser to 

General Wallenstein
. He also did fundamental work in the field of 
optics and helped to legitimize the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary 


Galileo Galilei

.


Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between 
astronomy and 
astrology, while there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of 
mathematics within the 
liberal arts) and 
physics (a branch of the more prestigious discipline of 
philosophy).

Lists of tropical cyclones by area
Texas hurricanes




The List of Texas hurricanes from 1944 to 1979 ecompasses 29 cyclones that have affected the 
U.S. State of 


Texas

. Among the worst storms include 

Hurricane Beulah
 in 1967, 

Hurricane Carla
 in 1961 and 

Tropical Storm Amelia
 in 1978. 


1945 - 1949 


The second storm of 1945 hit southern Texas, causing no reported damage. The fifth hurricane of the same year made landfall near Port Aransas in central Texas as a 140 mph (230 km/h) Category 4 hurricane. Towns from Freeport to Brownsville were subjected to hurricane force winds, causing around $20 million (1945 US dollars) in damages, and three deaths. 1


The first storm of 1946 hit near the Texas/Louisiana border, causing no damage.2


The third storm of the 1947 season made landfall in the state. 3


Hurricane 10 of the 1949 season made landfall in Texas after crossing in from the Pacific basin. 4




1950s


In 1950, Tropical Storm How hit the Mexican coast 150 miles (240 km) south of Brownsville. Damage was reported as far north as Port Aransas. Corpus Christi had gusts to 39 mph (63 km/h). Tides rose to 4' at Padre Island. Sections of highway on North Padre Island at Gulf Park were washed away. 5





Audrey (1957)



The first 

Hurricane Alice
 of 1954 dissipated over Texas. Heavy rains caused major crop damage to cotton crops, as well as 55 deaths. 6 The next storm, Tropical Storm Barabara made landfall near Sabine Pass, Texas. An October 1954 depression caused rainfall in Texas.7


Hurricane Gladys of 1955 struck 140 miles (230 km) south of Brownsville as a category 1 hurricane on the 5th. The rainfall total at Flour Bluff was 17.02 . Corpus Christi saw 7.6  of rain in 24 hours. Tides rose to 4.5'. A circulation center rotating around the eastern periphery of the storm moved onshore on the 7th south of Baffin Bay. Locals to the area named it  Glasscock , after the oil platform 15 miles (24 km) east of Port Aransas that recorded winds of 83 mph (134 km/h). Winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) were seen at Flour Bluff. Damage was confined to the coast. 8





Hurricane Audrey
 made landfall near 
Sabine Pass, Texas on 
June 27, 
1957, as a 145 mph (233 km/h) Category 4 hurricane.9,10,11,12 Audrey's 12-foot (3.7 m) storm surge devastated Cameron, Louisiana and Sabine Pass, TX, causing $150 million in damage.  Audrey was responsible for at least 390 deaths, although other sources claim the number could be over 500. Audrey is ranked as the sixth deadliest hurricane to hit the United States mainland.  The next storm to hit the 








United States







 to cause more fatalities was Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  Audrey remains the earliest known category four hurricane to form in the Atlantic Basin. Like 1954, the next storm of the season, Tropical Storm Bertha, made landfall in Texas.




Tropical Storm Alma
 of 1958 hit northeastern Mexico 70 miles (110 km) south of 

Brownsville, Texas
. It dissipated the following day after causing one indirect death from drowning. 13


Ella of 1958 hit southeastern 


Texas

 on the 6th of September, and dissipated later that day. Ella caused a total of $200,000 in damage (1958 dollars) and 37-39 deaths 14 in 

Cuba
 and 

Haiti
 from drowning. In addition, 

Galveston
 received torrential rainfall amounting to 13.6 inches (350 mm). 15





Hurricane Debra
 in 1959 hit between 

Freeport, Texas
 and 

Galveston, Texas
 as a minimal hurricane. It weakened over Texas, and dissipated over western 





Oklahoma




. Debra caused a total of $7 million (1959 dollars) in damage, but no fatalities. 16






1960s





Carla (1961)





Tropical Storm One
 of 1960 hit 30 miles (48 km) south of 
Corpus Christi, Texas as a 45 mph (72 km/h) storm. The storm looped over southern Texas, dumping heavy rain over the area. It moved slowly northward, and eventually dissipated over 





Illinois




. Though weak, the storm caused $3.6 million in damage (1960 dollars) and 15 deaths. 17


September 11, 1961: 

Hurricane Carla
 made landfall near 

Port Lavaca
 as a Category 4 hurricane. With an estimated central pressure of 931 mb at landfall, Carla was one of the largest and most intense hurricanes to strike the United States, and the strongest ever to hit Texas. Gusts as high as 170 mph (270 km/h) were estimated at Port Lavaca. Carla killed 31 people in Texas. The low death toll is credited to what was then the largest peacetime evacuation in 








United States







 history up until that time. One half million residents headed inland from exposed coastal areas. Carla caused a total of $325 million ($2.03 billion in 2005 USD) in damage.1819





Beulah (1967)


 

Hurricane Cindy
 in 1963 made landfall on 




High Island, Texas



. Cindy brought heavy rain to southeast Texas as it drifted southwestward over the state. The hurricane dissipated after causing $12.5 million (1963 dollars; $76 million 2005 USD) in damage and three deaths. 20




Tropical Storm Abby
 the very next year hit 




Matagorda, Texas



 as a 65 mph (105 km/h) tropical storm, dissipating the following day. Abby was a small system; its complete circulation at the surface was less than 100 
miles (160 km) in diameter. Because of this, Abby caused only $750,000 (1964 dollars; $30.7 million 2005 USD) in damage, most of it from crop damage. 21


In 1967, 

Hurricane Beulah
 made landfall just north of the mouth of the 

Rio Grande
 as a Category 3 storm. highest sustained wind was reported as 136 MPH, recorded in South Padre Island, about 20 miles (32 km) north of Port Isabel. The lower Rio Grande Valley, the four county region that comprises deep south Texas, was inundated with torrential rains and strong winds. Gusts of over 100 MPH were recorded as far inland as the towns of McAllen, Edinburg, Mission, and Pharr, some fifty miles from the gulf coast. Beulah was a record tornado-producer (a record that would stand until 2004) that destroyed homes, commercial property, and inflicted serious damage on the region's agricultural industry.  The Rio Grande Valley's citrus industry, based on cultivation of the famous  Ruby Red  grapefruit, was particularly hard hit. Padre Island, just off the Texas gulf coast, suffered significant devastation, and the island's sensitive ecosystem was altered by the storm.  Within a 36 hour period it dropped almost 30 inches of rain in Beeville, Texas.  Hurricane Beulah caused an estimated $1.1 billion (in 2000 dollars) in damage. Sources report 58-59 deaths from the storm. 22


In 1968, 

Tropical Storm Candy
 moved inland over southeast Texas, causing heavy flooding, crop damage, and tornadoes. 23






1970s




 1970 





Celia (1970)







Hurricane Celia
 of 1970 made landfall in Texas. Celia killed 20 due to extreme gusts, and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. The storm produced microbursts, which are rare in a tropical cyclone. The windbursts caused heavy damage across the city. In 
Corpus Christi, Texas, one person was reported dead with over 460 others injured. Damage accumulated was about $1.8 billion dollars (1998 USD). In 




Port O'Connor, Texas



, the storm broke several wind gauges and killed four people. Along the coast, boats were pushed ashore. 24


Later that year, 
Tropical Storm Felice made landfall in 


Texas

.



Carmen (1974)







 1971 



Hurricane Edith caused tides up to 6' in Sabine Pass in 1971, soon 

Hurricane Fern
 made landfall between 

Freeport, Texas
 and Matagorda, Texas as a tropical storm. Damage was minimal. 25




 1973 




Tropical Storm Delia
 in 1973 made its first landfall on the Southeast Texas coast near Freeport, and after a loop it hit Freeport again a few days later. This became the first known tropical cyclone to hit the same area twice. Six days later, Tropical Depression Six stalled over the Freeport, Texas area from the 10th to the 12th, bringing more rain to coastal areas that had already been saturated by Tropical Storm Delia. The depression caused $15 million more in crop damages. 26




 1974 


In 1974, 

Hurricane Carmen
 made landfall in Louisiana producing heavy rainfall throughout Eastern Texas. 27





Caroline (1975)








Ameila (1978)







 1975 




Hurricane Caroline
 of 1975 made landfall 100 miles (160 km) south of 

Brownsville, Texas
.




 1977 




Hurricane Anita
 of 1977 made medium rainfall throughout the eastern Texas coast. 28




 1978 




Tropical Storm Amelia (1978)
, with flooding rains, led to the deaths of 30 people in Texas in late July 1978. Later that year, 

Tropical Storm Debra
 made landfall halfway between 











Lake Charles, Louisiana










 and 

Beaumont, Texas
, causing minimal damage. 29




 1979 


From July 24-27, 1979, 

Tropical Storm Claudette
 produced torrential rains in both 


Texas

 and 





Louisiana




 when it made landfall. The highest total was reported in 

Alvin, Texas
 where 42 inches (1,100 mm) of rain fell. This remains the twenty-four hour rainfall record for any location in the United States. 30


Later in 1979, 

Tropical Storm Elena
 made landfall near 




Sargent, Texas



 as a weak tropical storm, rapidly deteriorating as it moved inland. It caused less than $10 million dollars (1979 USD; $28 million 2005 USD) in damage but managed to kill two people in floods.


Again in 1979, 

Tropical Depression 20
 produced rainfall in Louisiana and Texas after hitting Brownsville. 31

Swedish Inheritance Fund (Allmanna arvsfonden) is a 




Swedish government



 
fund, established in 1928 when the 
Swedish Parliament decided to abolish the right of 
inheritance for 
cousins and more distant relatives. When a person in Sweden dies without a written 
will and no living spouse or close family, his or her 
property is transferred to the fund; the fund also receives money from 
gifts and wills. The purpose of the fund is to support 
non-profit organizations and other 
voluntary associations to help improve conditions for 
children, young people and the 
disabled. The fund is administered by the 


Swedish National Board of Trade

. Applications for grants from the fund, however, are reviewed and decided by the 
Swedish Inheritance Fund Commission, an agency that answers to the 
Ministry for Health and Social Affairs.

The Swedish Interitance Fund receives properties from around 600 individuals each year. One of its largest additions was reported in January 2007, when the fund received 68 million 

kronor
 from a deceased 86-year old man in a 
village outside 
Umea in northern 







Sweden






, much to the surprise of his neighbours.


The only other 
country with a state-governed inheritance fund is 



Iceland


.

Alumni of the Open University
Scottish Labour Party politicians
Living people
Scottish independent politicians
1942 births




Henry Bell McCubbin (born 
15 July, 
1942) is a 

Scottish
 politician. After a career as a film cameraman for television companies, he served one term in the 

European Parliament
 for the 

Labour Party
; more recently he has left the party, but remains involved in politics.


Early career


McCubbin was born in 

Glasgow
 and educated at 




Allan Glen's School



. He joined the 

BBC
 as a film cameraman, moving to 
Grampian TV in 1977. He studied at the 

Open University
 where he obtained an honours degree.




European Parliament


At the 






1989 European elections





, McCubbin was elected as 
Member of the European Parliament for North East Scotland. He had only 30.6% of the vote, and a lead of only 2,613 over the next candidate. McCubbin concentrated on the fishing industry, which employed many constituents and was profoundly affected by the 

European Union
's 








Common Fisheries Policy







. He highlighted the relatively poor deal that Britain received under CFP allocations.


In December 1993, McCubbin wrote a pamphlet together with fellow MEP and veteran pamphleteer 
Ken Coates which argued that deregulation had harmed the economy, and called for a shorter working week. An analysis of European Parliament attendance records showed him as one of the most diligent of British MEPs. He introduced legislation to improve safety on offshore installations, another key constituency concern. At the 






1994 election





, McCubbin campaigned on a pledge to reduce unemployment, but was defeated by 

Scottish National Party
 candidate 












Allan Macartney











.




Further political career


He kept up contact with the European institutions. He was nominated unsuccessfully for the role of European Ombudsman in late 1994, and in 1996 was appointed as Head of the European Office of the Association of 

Greater Manchester
 Authorities. He resigned in 1999 to seek selection as a Labour candidate for the 

Scottish Parliament
, and also attempted to return to Europe when Allan Macartney died and a byelection was held. By this time, McCubbin's left-wing beliefs were regarded with concern and he was ruled out of the selection and placed at the bottom of the party list for the European Parliament.




Disillusion with Labour


McCubbin then resigned from the list completely. He attacked the government of 



Tony Blair


 in letters to Scottish newspapers, and in March 1999 confirmed that he had left the Labour Party over the 

bombing of Iraq
. In the 









Ayr byelection








 in 2000 (McCubbin had his home in 

Ayr
), he appeared at a press conference in support of the 

Scottish Socialist Party
 candidate, although he said he had not joined the party.


Later that year McCubbin helped to launch 










Scottish Left Review









, a bi-monthly journal of left-wing politics; he has been a member of its Editorial Committee ever since. At the 






2004 European Parliament election





, he endorsed the 

Scottish Green Party
 over its policy on fisheries, and has subsequently become a member.

Elias and four companions, Daniel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Samuel were 

Egyptian
 
martyrs who visited 
Christians condemned 
for life to 
slave work in the 
mines of 






Roman Cilicia





, during 

Maximinus
' 
persecution, to comfort them.1 In 309, on their return to 

Egypt
, they were stopped at the gates of 









Caesarea








, 








Palestine







, and questioned. Upon confessing the reason for their journey, they were 
arrested and brought before the 


provincial

 





governor




 






Firmilian





, who interrogated them further. 
Accused of being Christians, they were all 
tortured and then 
beheaded.2 

St. Pamphilus
 was also caught up in the martyrdom, sharing Elias  
fate. When Porphyry, a servant of Pamphilus, demanded that the bodies be buried, he was tortured and then 


burned to death

 when it was found that he was a Christian. St. Seleucus witnessed his death and applauded his constancy in the face of this terrible death; whereupon he was arrested by the 
soldiers involved in the 
execution, brought before the governor, and was beheaded at Firmilian's order.3 The 
historian 


















Eusebius

















 was in 








Caesarea







, and gave a vivid account of their martyrdom by torture and beheading.1


St. Elias and companions' 



feast day


 is on 
February 16.

Norse mythology
Trees in mythology




In 
Norse mythology, Glasir (

Old Norse
  gleaming 1) is a tree with golden leaves located in 

Asgard
 outside the doors of 



Valhalla


. According to the 
Skaldskaparmal section of the 

Prose Edda
:


 Glasir stands with golden leaf before Sigtyr's [Odin's] halls. 2


It is described as  the most beautiful tree among gods and men , and  Glasir's foliage  is sometimes used as a 
kenning for gold.

The most notable similarity between Glasir and 





Yggdrasil




 (or 
Laradr), the 
World Tree, is the location of both relative to the hall of 

Odin
, but the identification of one with the other has never been established with certainty.

BBCH-scale




In biology, the BBCH-scale for bulb vegetables describes the 
phenological development of bulb vegetable plants, such as 
onion, 
leek, 
garlic and 
shallot, using the 
BBCH-scale.

The phenological growth stages and BBCH-identification keys of bulb vegetables are:

Rivers of Santa Clara County, California

Rivers of Alameda County, California







Arroyo del Valle in 

Pleasanton, California




Arroyo del Valle is a westward-flowing 
stream in 

Alameda County
 and 

Santa Clara County, California
, 
USA, that is tributary to 



Arroyo de la Laguna


 which in turn flows into 



Alameda Creek


.  The stream drains  much of the southern portion of the 

city of Livermore
, and it also flows through and drains a considerable fraction of 

the city of Pleasanton
.  
Water quality measurements in this stream indicate a 
pH level of 7.0, or neutral with respect to 
acidity; 
phosphate levels were not detectable.1  In previous times the Arroyo del Valle had a significant 
steelhead migration; however, degradation of the stream in the latter half of the 20th century has decimated this 
anadromous fish population. 
2

In the middle reaches of Arroyo del Valle south of Livermore, there has been considerable historic 
grazing use.   Depth to groundwater in this reach of the watershed typically ranges from 50 


feet

 (15 
m) to 100 feet (30 m) and flows to the west.3  Subsequent to this reach, the Arroyo del Valle flows down the moderately sloping hills to enter 
gravel pits, where extraction (but not processing) has historically been conducted by 
Lone Star Industries.


The total length of the stream is 33 miles (53 km).4

An electrical conduit is a purpose-designed electrical 
piping 
system used for protection and routing of 
electrical wiring.  Electrical conduit may be made of metal, 
plastic, fibre, or fired clay.  Flexible conduit is available for special purposes. 


Conduit is generally installed by 
electricians at the site of installation of electrical equipment. Its use, form, and installation details are often specified by wiring regulations, such as the U.S. 


NEC

 or other national or local code.


Early electric lighting installations made use of existing gas pipe to gas light fixtures (converted to electric lamps). Since this technique provided very good protection for interior wiring, it was extended to all types of interior wiring and by the early 20th century purpose-built couplings and fittings were manufactured for electrical use.  



Comparison with other wiring methods



Electrical conduit provides very good protection to enclosed conductors from impact, moisture, and chemical vapors. Varying numbers, sizes, and types of conductors can be pulled into a conduit, which simplifies design and construction compared to multiple runs of cables or the expense of customised composite cable. Wiring systems in 
buildings are subject to frequent alterations. Frequent wiring changes are made simpler and safer through the use of electrical conduit, as existing conductors can be withdrawn and new conductors installed, with little disruption along the path of the conduit. A conduit system can be made waterproof or submersible. Metal conduit can be used to shield sensitive circuits from electromagnetic interference, and also can prevent emission of such interference from enclosed power cables. 


When installed with proper sealing fittings, a conduit will not permit the flow of flammable gases and vapors, which provides protection from fire and explosion hazard in areas handling volatile substances. 


Some types of conduit types are approved for direct encasement in concrete.  This is commonly used in commercial buildings to allow electrical and communication outlets to be installed in the middle of large open areas.  For example, retail display cases and open-office areas use floor-mounted conduit boxes to connect power and communications cables. 


Both metal and plastic conduit can be bent at the job site to allow a neat installation without excessive numbers of manufactured fittings. This is particularly advantageous when following irregular or curved building profiles. 


The cost of conduit installation is higher than other wiring methods due to the cost of materials and labour. In applications such as residential construction, the high degree of physical damage protection is not required so the expense of conduit is not warranted. Conductors installed within conduit cannot dissipate heat as readily as those installed in open wiring, so the current capacity of each conductor must be reduced (Ampacity Derating) if many are installed in one conduit. It is impractical, and prohibited by wiring regulations, to have more than 360 degrees of total bends in a run of conduit, so special outlet fittings must be provided to allow conductors to be installed without damage in such runs. While metal conduit can be used as a 
grounding conductor, the circuit length is limited.  A long run of conduit as grounding conductor will not allow proper operation of overcurrent devices on a fault, for example.




Types of conduit



Conduit systems are classified by the wall thickness of tubing, mechanical stiffness of the tubing, and material used to make the tubing. Tubing with thicker walls in the same material offers better protection from impact, but increases the weight and cost of the conduit and also increases labor cost to install the system.  



Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC)


Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC) is a thick threaded tubing, usually made of coated steel, though it may be aluminum. Thicker-walled than IMC.




Rigid Nonmetallic Conduit (RNC)


Rigid Nonmetallic Conduit (RNC) is a non-metallic unthreaded tubing.




Galvanized rigid conduit (GRC)


Galvanized rigid conduit (GRC) is galvanized steel tubing, with a tubing wall that is thick enough to allow it to be threaded.  Its common applications are in commercial and industrial construction. 1




Electrical metallic tubing (EMT)


Electrical metallic tubing (EMT), sometimes called thin-wall, is commonly used instead of galvanised rigid conduit (GRC), as it is less costly and lighter than GRC. EMT is not threaded. Lengths of conduit are connected to each other and to equipment with clamp-type fittings.  Like GRC, EMT is more common in commercial and industrial buildings than in residential applications. EMT is generally made of coated steel, though it may be aluminum.




Electrical Nonmetallic Tubing (ENT)


Electrical Nonmetallic Tubing (ENT) is a thin-walled corrugated tubing that is moisture-resistant and flame retardant. It is pliable such that it can be bent by hand and is often flexible although the fittings are not. It is not threaded due to its corrugated shape although the fittings might be.




 Flexible Metallic Conduit (FMC) 


Flexible Metallic Conduit (FMC) is made through the coiling of a self-interlocked ribbed strip of aluminum or steel, forming a hollow tube through which wires can be pulled. 


FMC is used primarily in dry areas where it would be impractical to install EMT or other non-flexible conduit, yet where metallic strength to protect conductors is still required. The flexible tubing does not maintain any permanent bend.


Cutting FMC requires a specialized hand tool with a rotary abrasive disc to creates a small incision into the ribbing so that a twisting motion separates the segments. The disc cuts deep enough to sever the armor coil but not so deep that it could damage the inside conductors. 


Short segments of FMC called whips are often used as circuit  pigtails  between fixtures and a 
junction box, especially in 
suspended ceilings. Whip assemblies save a great deal of repetitive labor when installations require several pigtails for several fixtures.


Flexible metal conduit coated with a UV-resistant polymer is liquid-tight when installed with appropriate 
glandular fittings containing liquid-tight features such as 
O-rings.


Wiring regulations vary; in locales following the U.S. 


National Electric Code

 (NEC), flexible metallic conduit may serve as an equipment-grounding conductor. Other areas may require a bonding wire for equipment grounding. The bonding wire in direct contact with the interior of the conduit creates a lower resistance grounding conductor than the conduit alone. 




Liquidtight Flexible Metal Conduit (LFMC)


Liquidtight Flexible Metal Conduit (LFMC) is a non-metallic and liquidtight jacket covering a flexible metal interior. The interior is similar to FMC. Originally designed and manufactured by 
Kopex International




Flexible Metallic Tubing (FMT)


Flexible Metallic Tubing (FMT) is a liquidtight metallic tubing but unlike LFMC, it lacks a non-metallic jacket.




Liquidtight Flexible Nonmetallic Conduit (LNFC)


Liquidtight Flexible Nonmetallic Conduit (LNFC) refers to several types of flame-resistant non-metallic tubing. Interior surfaces may be smooth or corrugated. There may or may not be integral reinforcement within the conduit wall. It is also known as FNMC.




Aluminium conduit




Aluminium conduit, similar to 
Galvanised Metal Conduit (GMC), is a rigid conduit, generally used in commercial and industrial applications, where a higher resistance to 
corrosion is needed. Such locations would include 
food processing plants, where large amounts of 
water and cleaning chemicals would make galvanised conduit unsuitable.  Aluminium cannot be directly embedded in 
concrete, since the metal reacts with the 
alkalis in 
cement.  The conduit may be coated to prevent 
corrosion by incidental contact with concrete. The extra cost of aluminium is somewhat offset by the lower labour cost to install, since a length of aluminium conduit will have about one-third the weight of an equally-sized rigid steel conduit.




Intermediate metal conduit (IMC)


Intermediate Metal Conduit (IMC) is a steel tubing heavier than EMT but lighter than RMC. It may be threaded.




PVC conduit



PVC conduit is the lightest in weight compared to other conduit materials, and usually lower in cost than other forms of conduit. In North American electrical practice, it is available in three different wall thicknesses, with the thin-wall variety only suitable for embedded use in concrete, and heavier grades suitable for direct burial and exposed work.  The various fittings made for metal conduit are also made for PVC. The plastic material resists moisture and many corrosive substances, but since the tubing is non-conductive an extra bonding (grounding) conductor must be pulled into each conduit. PVC conduit may be heated and bent in the field.  Joints to fittings are made with slip-on solvent-welded connections,which set up rapidly after assembly and attain full strength in about one day. Since slip-fit sections do not need to be rotated during assembly, the special union fittings used with threaded conduit (Ericson) are not required. Since PVC conduit has a higher 
thermal coefficient of expansion than other types, it must be mounted so as to allow for expansion and contraction of each run.  Care should be taken when installing PVC underground in multiple or parallel run configurations due to mutual heating effect of cable




 Other metal conduits


In extreme corrosion environments where plastic coating of the tubing is insufficient, conduits may be made from 
stainless steel, 
bronze or  
brass.  




Underground conduit




Large diameter (more than 2 inch/50 mm) conduit may be installed underground between buildings to allow installation of power and communication cables. An assembly of these conduits, often called a duct bank, may either be directly buried in earth or encased in concrete. A duct bank will allow replacement of damaged cables between buildings or additional power and communications circuits to be added, without the expense of excavation of a trench.  While metal conduit is occasionally used for burial, usually PVC, polyethlyene or polystyrene plastics are now used due to lower cost.  Formerly, compressed asbestos fibre mixed with cement was used for some underground installations. Telephone and communications circuits were installed in fired-clay conduit.

Fittings



Despite the similarity to pipes used in 
plumbing, purpose-designed 
fittings are used to connect conduit.


Box connectors join conduit to a junction box or other electrical box. A typical box connector is inserted into a knockout in a junction box, with the threaded end then being secured with a ring (called a lock nut) from within the box, as a 
bolt would be secured by a nut.  The other end of the fitting usually has a 
screw or compression ring which is tightened down onto the inserted conduit. Fittings for non-threaded conduits are either secured with set screws or with a compression nut that encircles the conduit.  Fittings for general purpose use with metal conduits may be made of die-cast zinc, but where stronger fittings are needed, they are made of copper-free aluminum or cast iron.


Couplings connect two pieces of conduit together.


Sometimes the fittings are considered sufficiently conductive to bond (electrically unite) the metal conduit to a metal junction box (thus sharing the box's ground connection); other times, grounding bushings are used which have 
bonding jumpers from the bushing to a grounding screw on the box.3


Unlike water piping, if it the conduit is to be watertight, the idea is to keep water out, not in.  In this case, the fittings have 
gaskets, such as the 
weatherhead leading from the overhead 
electrical 
mains to the 
electric meter.


Flexible metal conduit usually uses fittings with a clamp on the outside of the box, just like bare cables would.



 Conduit bodies 



A conduit body is used in electrical wiring to enable the installation of 
conductors (
wires) being placed within a conduit. Conduit bodies are different from 
junction boxes: a junction box is commonly used to provide space for 
splicing wires, while a conduit body is only used to access wires for pulling. Conduit bodies are also commonly referred to as condulets;  condulet  is a term trademarked by Cooper Crouse-Hinds company.


Conduit bodies come in various types and moisture ratings, using different mechanical methods of securing the pipe like conduit to the body: LB, LL, LR are types where the opening is on the back, left and right, respectively.  A type T  ( Tee ) conduit body is like the capital letter of the alphabet   a combination of an LL and LR.  The type C (coaxial) conduit body is used to pull conductors in a straight run of conduit or tubing, as it makes no turn between inlet and outlet conduit opening. 


 L  fittings (LB, etc.) are also to enable a 90 degree corner in the conduit where there is insufficient space to mount a full-radius 90 degree sweep (curved conduit section).  Ells  are also frequently used external to a building where a circuit passes through the wall either to underground conduit or up a wall via exterior wiring.





Other wireways




Raceway (wire molding)


This type of  decorative  conduit is designed to provide an aesthetically acceptable passageway for wiring without hiding it inside or behind a wall.  This is used where additional wiring is required, but where going through a wall would be difficult or require 
remodeling.  The conduit has an open back and is placed over the wire and secured to the surface.  
Plastic raceway is often used for 
telecom wiring, such as 
network cables in an older 
school, where it is not practical to 
drill through 
concrete block.





Advantages:


 It allows one to add new wiring to an existing 
building without removing or cutting holes into the 
drywall or 
lath and plaster.


 It allows circuits to be easily locatable and accessible for future changes thus enabling minimum effort upgrades.


Disadvantages:


 Its appearance may not be acceptable to all observers. 






 Trunking 


The term trunking is used in the United Kingdom for electrical wireways, usually made from PVC (for mounting on walls) or metal (for embedding into walls).


Mini Trunking is a term used in the UK for small form-factor (usually 6mm to 25mm square or rectangle sectioned) PVC wire ways. 4


In North American practice  wire trough  or  lay-in wireways  are terms used to designate similar products, but these are never used enclosed in masonry or a wall.





Passive fire protection



Conduit is of relevance to both 
firestopping, where they become 
penetrants, and 
fireproofing, where 
circuit integrity measures can be applied on the outside to keep the internal cables operational during an accidental 
fire. The British standard BS476 also considers internal fires, whereby the fireproofing must protect the surroundings from cable fires. Any 




external treatments



 must consider the effect upon ampacity derating.

Bilston
, 

West Midlands

The Kings N Things are a 
drag king performance troupe from 

Austin, Texas
. They describe themselves as  a performance troupe of humans who consciously perform gender in the spirit of non-conformity. 1 The troupe was founded in 2001 by Austinite filmmakers 
Mocha Jean Herrup and 
K Bradford. In following years, many performers came and left the group, most notably after a falling out between members in 2003. In 2006, Kings N Things combined forces with other local gender performers to host the 8th annual 
International Drag King Community Extravaganza as the 
Austin Dragsters. Kings N Things set themselves apart from other drag king troupes through a conscious effort to include diverse gender identities in their performances, challenging the 
gender binary. They also incorporate many political themes, most notably against 
rape, 
domestic violence, 
equal marriage rights, social equality, and the 
war in Iraq. The troupe was named  Best Drag King Group  in the 2002 
Austin Chronicle  Best Of  awards2 and consistently raises money and awareness for local charities and community organizations.

Ciappo Ubriachi

120526628
2007-04-05T17:24:00Z

NawlinWiki

People from Florence
Characters in written fiction




Ciappo Ubriachi was a 

 Florentine
 
nobleman who lived in the late 
1200s around the time of 

 Giotto
 and 
Dante. In the 
 Florentine Guelph-Ghibelline conflict, his family was a 
Ghibelline. He is best known for being a wicked 
usurer according to 





 Dante




 in the 








Divine Comedy







. 


Place in Dante's Inferno''


In 
Dante s 
 Comedy, Dante says that he saw Ciappo in the inner ring of the 








 Seventh Circle of Hell







, where the violent are eternally punished. The inner ring of the Seventh Circle is a burning hot desert with a continual rain of fire. The usurers are to be found sitting on the sand, swatting away fire the way that animals swat bugs, and crying. Around their necks are found purses emblazoned with their 
 coats of arms. This, and a bit of research into Dante's time-period, make it possible to identify who the suffering sinners are meant to be. 


Usurers are considered violent because, as Dante's 



Virgil


 explains in Canto XI, usurers sin against Art, and Art is the Grandchild of God.





Relevant lines from The Inferno with explanations (Mendelbaum translation)



So I went on alone and even farther (43)


along the seventh circle s outer margin,


to where the 
 melancholy people sat.




 Despondency was bursting from their eyes; (46)


this side, then that, their hands kept fending off,


at times the flames, at times the burning soil:



Not otherwise do dogs in summer-now (49)


with muzzle, now with paw-when they are bitten


by fleas or gnats or by the sharp gadfly.



When I had set my eyes upon the faces (52)


of some on who the painful fire falls,


I recognized no one; but I did notice



That from the neck of each a purse was hung (55)


that had a 
 special color or an emblem,


and their eyes seemed to feast upon these pouches.



Looking about-when I had come among them- (58)


I saw a 
 yellow purse with azure on it



 that had the face and manner of a lion. 


Then, as I let my eyes move further on, (61)


I saw another purse that was blood-red,


and it displayed a goose more white than butter. (This person is Ciappo, because 
 a white goose on a field red was the arms of Ciappo s family, the Ubriachi. )



And 
 one who had an azure, pregnant sow



inscribed as emblem on his white pouch, said


io me:  What are you doing in this pit?



Now be off; and since you re still alive, (67)


remember that my neighbor 
 Vitaliano


shall yet sit here, upon my left hand side.



Among these 

 Florentines
, I m 

 Paduan
; (70)


I often hear them thunder in my ears,


shouting,  Now let the 
 sovereign cavalier,




 The one who ll bring the purse with three goats, come!   (73)


At this he slewed his mouth, and then he stuck


his tongue out, like an ox that licks his nose.

Adelaide's first electric tram ( Type A ) on display at the Tramway Museum, 

St Kilda





Until 1958, Trams in Adelaide formed a network spanning most of 
suburban Adelaide, with a history dating back to 1878. Adelaide ran 
horse trams from 1878 to 1914 and electric 
trams from 1909, but has primarily relied on 
buses for 
public transport since 1958. Today there is a single remaining tram line with two classes of 
electric tram, built in 1929 and 2006, respectively. The tram line connects the 
central business district of 

Adelaide
, capital of 
South Australia, to the seaside suburb of 

Glenelg
. Electric trams and 
trolleybuses were Adelaide's main public transport throughout the life of the electric tram network and are enjoying a resurgence with the expansion of the remaining line and the first new tram purchases for more than 50 years.  


The early use of trams was for recreation as well as 
daily travel, by entire families and 
tourists. Until the 1950s, trams were used for family outings to the extent that the 
Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) constructed gardens in the suburb of 

Kensington Gardens
, extending the 

Kensington
 line to attract customers. By 1945 the MTT was collecting fares for 95 million trips annually 295 trips per head of population.


After the 





Great Depression




, the maintenance of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet and the growth of 
private 
car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network was losing money and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by a volunteer run museum and tramway at 

St Kilda
, and the continuing use of 1929 H Class trams on the remaining 

Glenelg tram line
.



 Horse trams 





Horse tram 18. Used in Adelaide from 1882 to 1910, first on the Walkerville line



In early 1855, less than twenty years after the colony was founded, South Australia's first horse tram began operating between 

Goolwa
 and 

Port Elliot
 on the 




Fleurieu Peninsula



.1 Just over twenty years later Adelaide became the first city in Australia to introduce horse trams, and eventually the last to discard them for more modern public transport. Although two trials of street level 
trains were run, the state of Adelaide's streets, with mud in winter and dust in summer, lead to the decision that they would not be reliable.2 Sir Edwin T. Smith and W. C. Buik, the latter formerly mayor of Kensington and Norwood, spent some time inspecting European tramways during the 1870s. They were impressed with horse tram systems and, on returning to Adelaide, they promoted the concept leading to a prospectus being issued for the Adelaide and Suburban Tramway Co. (A ST). Private commercial interests lobbied government for legislative support, over Adelaide council's objections related to licensing and control. As a result the 
Government of South Australia passed an 1876 private 
act, authorising construction of Adelaide's first horse tram network.3 It was scheduled for completion within two years, with 10.8 miles (17.4 km) of lines from 

Adelaide's city-centre
 to the suburbs of Kensington and 

North Adelaide
.4 Completed in May 1878,5 services began in June from Adelaide to 

Kensington Park
 with trams imported from John Stephenson Co. of New York, United States.6


Until 1907 all horse tram operations were by 







private companies






, with the government passing 
legislation authorising line construction. Growth of the network and rolling stock was driven largely by commercial considerations. On the opening day, the newly founded Adelaide and Suburban Tramway Co. (A ST) began with six trams, expanding to 90 trams and 650 horses by 1907 with its own tram 
manufacturing facility at Kensington.7 A Private act, passed in September 1881, allowed the construction of more private horse tramways and additional acts were passed authorising more line construction and services by more companies.8 Most of the companies operated 
double decker trams, although some were single level cabs with many built by John Stephenson Co., Duncan and Fraser of Adelaide, and from 1897 by the A ST at Kensington.7 The trams ran at an average speed of 5 miles per hour (8 km/h), usually two horses pulling each tram from a pool of four to ten.9





The horse tram network in 1907






 Horse tram network 


Various companies expanded the network from its initial line to Kensington, with eleven companies operating within six years, three more having already failed before constructing tracks.10 The Adelaide to 

North Adelaide
 line opened in December 1878, a separate one from 

Port Adelaide
 to 

Albert Park
 in 1879, Adelaide to 

Mitcham
 and 

Hindmarsh
 in 1881, 

Walkerville
 1882, 

Burnside
, 

Prospect
, 





Nailsworth




 and 

Enfield
 in 1883, and 

Maylands
 in 1892.11 Various streets were widened especially for the tram lines including Brougham place, North Adelaide by 10 feet (3 m) and Prospect road to a total width of 60 feet (18 m).1213


All but one line was built in 4 foot 8  
inch (1.435 m) 
standard gauge with the exception from Port Adelaide to Albert Park. This line was built in 5 foot 3 inch (1.6 m) 
broad gauge to accommodate steam engines, also requiring some of the line to be raised on 
embankments to avoid 
swampy ground and 
flooding.14 There were 74 miles (119 km) of tramlines with 1062 horses and 162 cars by 190115 and isolated lines from Port Adelaide to Albert Park and Glenelg to Brighton, as well as a network joining many suburbs to Adelaide's CBD by 1907. The network had termini in 

Henley Beach
, Hindmarsh, Prospect, Nailsworth, 

Paradise
, 

Magill
, Burnside, 

Glen Osmond
, Mitcham, 

Clarence Park
, 

Hyde Park
 and Walkerville.16 To accommodate the specific needs of horses, most streets were left 
unsealed. The horses' 
urine needed an unsealed surface for absorption and their hooves a soft surface for good traction.9





 Electric trams 





First Electric tram trial on November 30, 1908.






The opening of the Glenelg tram.



Adelaide's first experiment with electric powered trams was a demonstration run on the Adelaide and Hindmarsh Tramway company's line. A 



battery powered


 tram fitted with  Julien's Patent Electric Traction  ran in 1889 to Henley Beach. The trial was unsuccessful due to the batteries poor capacity, and the promoters' deaths in a 
level crossing accident shortly after precluded further experiments.17 As with horse trams, commercial interests pursued government support for the introduction of electric tramways. The most influential was the  Snow scheme , promoted by Francis H. Snow largely on behalf of two London companies, 


British Westinghouse

 and Callender's Cable Construction. The scheme involved the purchase of major horse tramways, merging into an electric tramway company with twenty-one years of exclusive running rights. Legislation was passed in 1901, a referendum held in 1902, but the required funds had been spent and the scheme collapsed. Adelaide's council proposed their own scheme backed by different companies, but couldn't raise the required capital, and J.H. Packard promoted various schemes of his own devising that also never eventuated.18


By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams were seen by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a population of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10 pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded.9 Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 
newspaper notice announced that the government had purchased all of the city tramways for 
 280,000.15 Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways.19


Not all tramway companies were purchased, as the Glenelg to 

Marino
 company continued operating separately until its failure in 1914.20 The government purchased the 
properties, plant and equipment of existing tramways but did not purchase the companies themselves.19 The equipment included 162 trams, 22 other vehicles and 1056 horses. By 1909 at the launch of Adelaide's electric tram services there remained 163 horse trams and 650 horses under the control of the MTT.21 Due to the time required to electrify the network the MTT continued to run horse trams until 1914. The cost of purchasing the tramways was funded by 
treasury bills19 and the act capped total construction costs at  12,000 per mile of track.22  457,000 was let in contracts to March 1908 for construction of the tramways, trams, strengthening the Adelaide bridge over the 

River Torrens
 and associated works.23 The official ceremony starting track construction was in May 1908, with tracks originally laid on 




Jarrah



 sleepers.24


On Monday 30 November 1908 there were two trial runs, from the MTT's depot on Hackney Road to the nearby 





Adelaide Botanic Garden




 and back, the evening trial carrying the Premier and 







Governor






.24  At the official opening ceremony on 9 March 1909, Electric Tram 1 was driven by Mrs. Price, wife of 

Premier
 










Thomas Price









. Mrs Price opened the tramway and drove the tram from the Hackney Depot to Kensington and back, assisted by the MTT's chief 
engineer.25



 Municipal Tramways Trust 





Main article: 
Municipal Tramways Trust


The MTT was created in 1906 and became part of the State Transport Authority in 1975. It was created as a tax-exempt body with eight members, mostly by appointed 
local councils but with some government appointees.26 They established a 9 acres (3.6 ha) tram depot site near the corner of Hackney Road and Botanic Road with a depot building, twenty-four incoming tracks and a large administration office.27 William George Toop Goodman was appointed as its first engineer, later general manager and remained as general manager until his 1950 retirement.28


To cater for family outings the MTT constructed gardens in the current suburb of Kensington Gardens, extending the Kensington line to attract customers.29 By 1945 the MTT was collecting fares for 95 million trips annually, representing 295 trips per head of population (350,000).30 


By 1958 the tram network was reduced to just the Glenelg line (see 
Decline of the network). The MTT continued to operate most of the local bus routes in the inner metropolitan area. In 1975 the services of the MTT became the Bus and Tram division of the 





State Transport Authority




 and the MTT ceased to exist.21





The electric tram network in the late 1950s







 Electric tram network 


At the 1909 opening, 35 miles (56 kilometres) of track had been completed with electricity supplied by the Electric Lighting and Supply Co.31 The electric tram system ran on 600 
Volts 
DC supplied at first from two 
converter stations,32 No.1 converter station on East terrace, Adelaide with 
2,500 kW of 
AC to DC capacity and No.2 station at 





Thebarton




 with a capacity of 900 kW.33 To cope with variable loads on the system, very large storage 
lead-acid batteries were installed, the initial one at East terrace comprising 293 
cells and a 50 
ton tank of 
sulphuric acid.34


The 

Adelaide-Glenelg
 line was, from 1873, a 
broad gauge steam railway that ran at street level into 















Victoria Square














.35 Originally privately owned it was taken over by the 



South Australian Railways


 then transferred to the MTT in 1927. The line was closed to be rebuilt to standard gauge, electrified at 600 Volts DC and converted to tramway operation, reopening in late 1929.


The Port Adelaide line, which until that time had still used horse trams, began to be converted to electric operation in 1914 and opened 3 April 191721 A line from Magill to Morialta opened in 1915 for weekend tourist traffic with only a single return service on weekdays. The line ran in the valley of 4th creek, a tributary of the 

River Torrens
, across farmland and along unmade and ungazetted roads.36 All services on the Morialta line were replaced by buses in 1956. The last tram line built in Adelaide was the 

Erindale
 line which opened in early 1944.37 At maximum extent the lines connected Adelaide with the sea at Henley Beach, Grange and Glenelg, reached the base of the 

Adelaide Hills
 at 






Morialta





 and Mitcham and had Northern and Southern limits of 





Kilburn




 and 

Colonel Light Gardens
.38




 Electric tram types 


From 1908 to 1909, a hundred electric trams were manufactured by Duncan and Fraser of Adelaide39 at a cost of approximately  100 each.40 Up to its last tram purchase in 1953, the MTT commissioned over three hundred electric trams, some of which have been kept in service for over seventy-five years. 


TransAdelaide

, the publicly owned company now operating Adelaide trams, began introducing a new class of trams in 2006.

The original 103 was damaged during shipping from Germany. In its damaged form, it is now held for parts at TransAdelaide's Glengowrie depot. The replacement 103 was the final tram that was delivered, and is now in service. 


Type 100 Note: The Type 100 trams are occasionally referred to a S type trams due to their resemblance to VGF's S class trams in use in 
Frankfurt Am Main or NGT8 trams which is the designation used in 

Dortmund




 Type A




Type A trams were the most common on the newly opened lines with seventy of the initial hundred trams made in this single truck combination style. They incorporated a closed central saloon and open crossbenches on the same tram. Capable of up to 22 miles per hour (35 km/h), they had a seating capacity of twenty in the saloons with an additional twenty in the open benches. The bodies were made by Duncan and Fraser, who had built horse tram cars for the AS T as well as bodies of electric trams for 








Melbourne service







.46 On 9 March 1909 the first type A was the lead car in the procession at the tramway systems official opening. Most were removed from the lines and stored in the 1930s, returning to service in 1941 due to petrol rationing increasing passenger numbers. Fifty-eight were permanently joined in  Bib and Bub  (named after comic characters by 


May Gibbs

) pairs to conserve manpower and used this way until 1950. Although the bib and bub pairs still required a conductor per tram to collect fares, they needed only one driver per pair resulting in a twenty-five percent reduction in labour.47 All type As were withdrawn from service in 1952 with many being sold for use as shacks, although trams 10, 69 and 92 had been sold in 1936 to the 





State Electricity Commission of Victoria




.48





Restored  Toastrack  tram 42 at the St Kilda Tramway museum








 Type B




Thirty of the initial trams became known as 
Toast rack trams due to their open structure. They were open trams with passengers seated on cross-benches, and no weather protection on the cars' sides.46 Duncan and Fraser built them with summer excursions in mind but they had limited utility due to the lack of weather proofing. Twenty of the cars were converted to combination trams in 1917 and redesignated as types A1 and A2. All type B, A1 or A2 cars, except for tram 42, were withdrawn from service in 1936 and scrapped in 1946.48





 Type E




Due to public antipathy to imported trams, type E trams were built by J.G. Brill   Co in 

Philadelphia
, United States, then imported in parts and assembled by Pengelley   Co of Adelaide from 1910 to 1912.49 They were partially open trams with passengers sitting on cross bench seats and a closed saloon at one end. Their main use was on the Glen Osmond and St Peters routes, also taking picnic parties to Burnside and Magill. Type E trams were rebuilt into type E1 in 1936.





 Type E1




When converted from Type E trams, the crossbenches were removed and the saloon extended the entire car length. As before conversion, these trams were used mainly on the Glen Osmond and St Peters routes. Tram 101 was temporarily renumbered 100, painted in ivory and gold, and used in the 1936 South Australian centenary celebrations.50





 Type D




Similar to Type E with crossbenches and a saloon, type D trams also had sliding doors at the end of the benches giving weather protection. Four similar cars were built in 1912 for the 
Prahan   Malvern Tramways Trust, Melbourne, on sold to the 
Hawthorn Tramways Trust then purchased by the MTT in 1925 becoming trams 191-194.51 After injuries to 








conductors







 collecting fares while standing on the footboards, a centre isle was cut through the centre bulkhead and four of the six crossbench seats of the trams in 1934. Trams 192-194 had been similarly modified in Melbourne prior to their purchase by the MTT.





 Type C




A planned purchase of large trams was delayed by 

World War I
. Type C trams were small combination cars, built in 1918 1919 as an interim measure. Physically very similar to Type A trams, they were fitted with more powerful motors. Due to the their consequent higher speeds they became known as 
Desert Gold trams, after a New Zealand 
racehorse that had won races in Australia at the same time. This speed became useful in competition against unlicensed buses in the 1920s, and they were used in peak service until 1952 with the last use for the royal visit of 1954.





 Types F and F1




Type F and F1 trams, built from 1921 to 1929 by Pengelley   Co, became commonly known as dropcentre trams, as the centre of the tram was lowered for easy boarding and alighting. They had the first tram airbrakes in Adelaide and were designed so that six streams of passengers could board or alight at the same time, with a large capacity and reportedly comfortable ride.50 F series trams were the most common trams used in Adelaide from their introduction to the closure of the main tram network.





 Type G




Designed by Charles Birney and imported complete from J.G. Brill   Co these trams seated 32 passengers. They entered service as one man cars on the Port Adelaide line in 1925, were sold for use in 

Geelong
 in 1935 then transferred to 

Bendigo
 in 1947.52





 Type H




Known as Glenelg trams, Type H are a long rigid body tram that is end loading with a full length saloon, power operated doors and reversible leather seats. Built by Pengelley and Co in 1929 specifically for the Glenelg line, they commenced operations on 14 December 1929. They also saw service on the Henley North, Kensington Gardens and Cheltenham routes.52 As of 2007 there are five restored trams still in service for weekend, public holiday and charter trips. With the purchase of replacement trams, sixteen H class trams were disposed of with some sold, for a total of $65,000, and the remainder donated. They were destined for uses as varied as a restaurant, an attraction at a 
bed and breakfast 
boarding house and a tourism display at Glenelg, Adelaide.53





 Type H1





Flexity Classic tram in Adelaide's city centre


 
A prototype tram was built in 1952 based on a 1939 plan to build forty new trams. Tram 381 was just completed by JA Lawton   Sons of Adelaide when the reconstitution of the MTT caused cancellation of the remaining thirty-nine cars.52 It was a modern design with all steel construction and power operated doors, commencing service on the Henley North-Kensington Gardens in 1953 and withdrawn in 1957.





 Flexity Classic / Type 100 / Type I




Beginning in January 2006, 30 metres (98 ft) long, articulated, low-floor 






Flexity Classic





 
Light Rail vehicles, built by 
Bombardier in Germany, began operation. Eleven trams were ordered at a total cost of  $58 million to replace most of the seventy-seven year old H class on the Glenelg line.54 Bombardier won  the supply tender against one other bidder, receiving an initial order for nine trams in September 2004.55 Station platforms were lowered to match the new trams lower floors, and some of the track and sleepers replaced to provide a smoother ride. There have been problems with the tram's airconditioning systems, during Adelaide's very hot summer weather, but these were rectified with engineering changes to the trams.56


Classification of the trams has been controversial. The trams are generally referred to as Flexities or Flexity type by TransAdelaide, although are also referred to as type 100 (from their fleet numbers) or the I type following on from the MTT classification system. Other classifications by using designations in use on other systems with 






Flexity Classic





 trams, including S Class (VGF, Frankfurt), M06 (Norrkoping) and NGT8 (Dortmund) have also been used.


By 2008 the state government was considering lengthening the trams, instead of purchasing more, to accommodate increasing passenger numbers.57In September 2008, an order was placed with Bombardier for an additional 4 Flexity classic trams to be used on the soon to be built City West - Adelaide Entertainment Centre section. These will be numbered 112 - 115.





 Trolleybuses 


During the 





Great Depression




 the MTT needed to expand services but finances prevented laying new tracks. A decision was made to  trial 
trolleybuses, and a converted petrol bus began running experimentally on the Payneham and Paradise lines. Apart from the trial bus, the MTT eventually operated four models of trolleybuses.58
By 1937 there was a fleet of double-decker trolleybuses running to 

Tusmore
 with extensions to Port Adelaide, 

Semaphore
 and 





Largs Bay




 in 1938. Trolley buses continued running until July 1963 when the last run was converted to motorbuses.





 Green Goddess


Petrol bus 216 was converted to electric operation and ran from May 1932 to August 1934. It was the first trolleybus in Australia and become known as  The Green Goddess  by its distinctive 
livery. It seated twenty-three with room for twenty standing passengers.58





 A.E.C. double decker


Imported English trolleybus chassis were completed with bodywork by Lawtons of Adelaide in 1937, then numbered as buses 401 to 430. The A.E.C. trolleybuses seated fifty-seven with a crush load of eighty-four and were withdrawn in mid 1957, with a brief return to service in August 1958.58





 Leyland double decker


With chassis brought in from England prior to World War II, the MTT constructed buses 431 to 435. When put into service in 1942 the Leyland buses were the largest in the MTT fleet and remained so until withdrawn in 1958.58





 Leyland canton trolleybus


As part of the World War II supply effort, English bus chassis, with a final intended destination of the 

Guangdong
 province in China, were brought to Adelaide where they remained. The MTT built bodies for them from 1942 to 1944, as buses 501 to 530, with a seating capacity of thirty and a crush load of sixty. The became popularly known as cantons or wombats and remained in service until 1963.58





 Sunbeam trolleybus


Buses 501 to 530 were built by Lawtons of Adelaide on a 





Sunbeam




 chassis in late 1951. They seated forty passengers, had a crush load of seventy-seven and were used in services until mid 1963.58




 Decline of the network 





Double decker Garford bus, used by the MTT from 1927



From 1915 onwards the MTT had to compete against unregulated private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925.59 The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used a provision in the 
Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to 

Murrayville, Victoria
 (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time.60 Up until the end of 

World War I
, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during 







World War II






 lead to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.61


From the start of the great depression until the closure of the network only one lot of trams was purchased by the MTT. Due to shortages there was minimal maintenance of the network during World War II and post-war shortages prevented the purchase of new trams.62 In 1951 1952 the MTT lost  313,320 and made the decision to convert the Erindale, Burnside and Linden park lines to electric trolleybuses. The last trams on these lines ran on 24 May 1952 with the lines lifted from 18 April 1953. A 1953 
royal commission was held to inquire into the financial affairs of the MTT resulting in a completely reconstituted board.63 Late the same year, with driver safety concerns about the conflict with increasing traffic on the road, the Glen Osmond line was temporarily converted to motor buses. The line was never converted back to trams and much comment was made about the continuing maintenance of unused overhead lines.64


Trolley buses gradually made way for motor buses until the last electric tram or bus service ran on 12 July 1963 leaving only the Glenelg tramline as a remnant of a once extensive 
light rail network.65 Except for the Glenelg H class, the trams were sold off or scrapped, variously ending up being used as 
shacks, playrooms and preserved by museums.40



 Remaining line 





Main article: 

Glenelg Tram



The Glenelg line is a 11.9-kilometre (7.4 mi) route from the centre of Adelaide, South Australia to the beachside suburb of Glenelg. It is Adelaide's only remaining tramway, running at approximately twenty minute intervals, and is part of the integrated 



Adelaide Metro


 public transport network.66 Until January 2006, H class cars provided all services on the Glenelg line. Eleven, thirty metre long articulated low-floor 






Flexity Classic





 Light Rail vehicles, built by Bombardier in Germany, have since replaced the H-class trams in regular day-to-day service, although five refurbished H-class trams have been retained and operate a restricted 'heritage service' timetable on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays. They have been fitted with safety measures similar to those of the new trams, including vigilance control and electro-magnetic track brakes.


A 1.2-kilometre (0.75 mi) extension from Victoria Square, along 





King William St




 and 





North Tce




 opened to the public on 14 October 2007. Further extensions remain the subject of public debate. Tourism minister, 








Jane Lomax-Smith







 has, in 2007, expressed support for the line to be extended to North Adelaide and Prospect although the Transport minister has stated that this is not a practical option,67 with his preferred option the creation of a fare free city loop.68

Robert  Bo  Goldman (born 
September 10, 
1932) is an American writer, 
Broadway playwright and 

Academy Award
 winning 
screenwriter.


There are but a few select screenwriters who are spoken of with the kind of reverence usually reserved for film Directors - Robert Towne, Alvin Sargent and Bo Goldman. Goldman is a screenwriter's screenwriter, and one of the most honored in motion picture history. The recipient of two Academy Awards, a New York Film Critics Award, two Writers Guild Awards, three Golden Globes, additional Academy Award and Writers Guild nominations and ultimately the Guild's life achievement Award - The Laurel.  


Born in New York City, Goldman was educated at Exeter and Princeton where he wrote, produced, composed the lyrics and was president of the famed Triangle show, a proving ground for James Stewart and director Joshua Logan. On graduation, he went directly to Broadway as the lyricist for  First Impressions  based on Jane Austen's  Pride and Prejudice , produced by composer Jule Styne and directed by Abe Burrows, starring Hermione Gingold, Polly Bergen and Farley Granger.  


Moving into television, Goldman was mentored by the redoubtable Fred Coe (the  D.W. Griffith of dramatic television ) and became part of the twilight of The Golden Age, associate producing and script editing Coe's prestigious Playhouse 90's,  The Days of Wine and Roses ,  A Plot to Kill Stalin  and Horton Foote's  Old Man . Goldman went on to himself produce and write for Public Television on the award-winning NET Playhouse. During this period, Goldman first tried his hand at screen writing, resulting in an early version of Shoot the Moon (1982) which stirred the interest of Hollywood and became his calling card.  


After reading Shoot the Moon (1982), Milos Forman asked Goldman to write the screenplay for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). Goldman's first produced film won all five top Academy Awards including Best Screenplay for Goldman.  Cuckoo's Nest  was the first film to win the top five awards since Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1934). Goldman also received the Writers Guild Award and the Golden Globe Award for his work on the film.


  He next wrote The Rose (1979), which was nominated for four Academy Awards, followed by his original screenplay Melvin and Howard (1980) which garnered Goldman his second Oscar, second Writers Guild Award and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Screenplay of the Year.  


Goldman's first screenplay, Shoot the Moon (1982), that started it all, was then filmed by Alan Parker starring Diane Keaton and Albert Finney, the film received international acclaim and was embraced by America's most respected film critics including Pauline Kael and Richard Schickel. For Shoot the Moon (1982), Goldman earned his third Writers Guild nomination.  


Over the next few years, he contributed uncredited work to countless scripts including Milos Forman's Ragtime (1981) starring James Cagney and 'Donald O'Connor', The Flamingo Kid (1984) starring Matt Dillon and Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy (1990).  


Goldman tried his hand at directing an adaptation of Susan Minot's novel  Monkeys , and a re-imagining of Ingmar Bergman's Smultronstallet (1957) (aka Wild Strawberries) as a vehicle for Gregory Peck, but for budgetary and scheduling reasons, both movies lost their start dates.  


Goldman returned solely to screen-writing with Scent of a Woman (1992) starring Al Pacino. Goldman was honored with his third Academy Award nomination and his third Golden Globe Award. He followed this with Harold Becker's_City Hall (1996)_ starring Al Pacino and John Cusack, and then co-wrote Meet Joe Black (1998) starring Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.  


More recently, Goldman did a page one uncredited rewrite of The Perfect Storm (2000). It was Goldman's script that green lit the movie at Warner Bros. and convinced George Clooney to star in the film which went on to earn $327,000,000. 


 In 2005, he helped prepare the shooting script for Milos Forman's Goya's Ghosts (2006), produced by Saul Zaentz and starring Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem.

Dwarkanath Vidyabhusan

Chingripota, 



South 24 Parganas








Dwarkanath Vidyabhusan (

Bengali
:                      ) (
1820 - 
22 August 
1886) was an 

India
n scholar, editor and publisher of the trend-setting weekly 

Bengali
 newspaper Somprakash.



Father


His father, Harachandra Bhattacharya (better known as Nyayratna) was a scholar. He had studied under Kashinath Tarkalankar, who had a popular traditional centre of education at Hatibagan in north 

Kolkata
, Nyayratna taught in the traditional centres of 

Sanskrit
-based education called tol-chatuspatis and also taught some boys in his spare time at his home. Amongst his renowned students were 


Ishwar Chandra Gupta

 and 


Ramtanu Lahiri

.1




Early life


After initial education in the traditional centre of village education, the pathsala, Dwarkanath joined 







Sanskrit College






, Kolkata in 1832, and studied there up to 1845, winning many prizes and earning fame as a scholar.1He won the title of Vidyabhusan in his last examination. He had a short stint as a teacher in 


Fort William College

 and then joined Sanskrit College as a librarian. He later rose to the position of a professor and also assisted 

Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
, when he was principal of the college.1


A strong supporter of the women's education, Dwarkanath Vidyabhusan joined other liberals to support Bethune School (established by 


John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune

) for twenty years.2


In 1856, his father established a printing press.1 It must be mentioned that it was an age when publishers concentrated on an incongruous double bill of religion and erotica but tastes had started changing. In 1857, forty-six Indian-owned printing presses put out 322 books for sale. Although religion still held sway, erotica had started ebbing out.3 However, his father fell ill and died shortly after establishing the printing press. Vidyabhusan inherited the press and published in Bengali two volumes on the history of Greece and history of Rome, he had written. That was possibly the first time that fat volumes of history written in easy flowing Bengali language was published and it immediately established Vidybhusan as a writer.14




Somprakash





Front Page Of Somprakash


 


Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar proposed the publication of a weekly newspaper Somprakash partly with the objective of providing employment for a deaf scholar. The newspaper hit the stands in 1858 but the deaf scholar never joined it. The entire responsibility of editing and publishing the newspaper vested in Vidyabhusan. At that time, Bengali newspapers such as Sambad Prabhakar and Sambad Bhaskar were 'defiling the moral environment in Bengal'.1 With its dignified tastes, lucid language and fearless criticism, Somprakash occupied the top position in the field of Bengali newspapers.1


Initially, Somprakash was published from a lane in Champatala in Kolkata. When the railway was extended to Canning in 1862, he shifted the printing press to his native village Chingripota (renamed as Subhasgram), now in South 24 Parganas.1


It strongly criticised the powerful indigo planters and landlords. In his evidence before the Indigo Enquiry Committee, Rev. James Long emphatically stated,  These periodicals play a signifiacnt role as the mouthpiece of the Indian public. 5 In 1878, when the viceroy, 


Lord Lytton

, introduced the 
Vernacular Press Act, specially targeting the Bengali press, Vidyabhusan closed down Somprakash, rather than sign an undertaking about it, agreeing to follow the dictates of the authorities.51










Sir Richard Temple









, lieutenant governor, called him to his house and requested him not to close down the newspaper. Later, when the Act was withdrawn, he resumed publication of Somprakash, but it never regained its past form and glory.1




Later life


He established an English school in his native place called 
Harinavi DVAS High School(Harinavi Dwarkanath Vidyabhusan Anglo Sanskrit High School) and bore the expenses of running the same. A man of high moral standards he stood by the down trodden in society. With advancing age, his health started faltering. He published a monthly magazine Kalpadrum for sometime. Once he went and stayed in 











Varanasi










 for sometime and was shocked by the wretched state of affairs of religion and morals. He died at 

Satna
 where he had gone to recoup his health.1




Sivanath Sastri
 was his sister's son.1

Nebahat Albayrak

During a brief suspension of the meeting of the Tweede Kamer, she explained to Fritsma that the second was impossible because with out a law to base it on, the Tweede Kamer could not interfere in this matter. Fritsma changed his motion accordingly. Later Party for Freedom-leader 


Geert Wilders

 dismissed her actions as party-political.

Sears Holdings Corporation
Store brands





Celestial Star is the trademarked brand name that 

Sears Holdings Corporation
 uses for its certified diamond jewelry.  Celestial Star quality is also referred to as  best  diamond quality by Sears employees (other qualities are  Promotional,  Good , and  Better ).  Currently, the Celestial Star line is the highest in terms of diamond quality out of all Sears diamond jewelry.


Quality-wise, Celestial Star diamonds are minimum H-I (near colorless) in 
diamond color and I1-I2 in 
diamond clarity.  The jewelry is always 14k white or yellow 
gold.  However, these are only minimum requirements, and it is not unusual to see Celestial Star styles that use colorless or VS clarity diamonds.  Thus, Celestial Star jewelry can vary widely in appearance and value for the money you pay.


Celestial Star diamond jewelry comes with a credit card sized plastic  International Gemalogical Information  appraisal summary.  Each piece is independently graded and assigned an  estimated retail replacement value  by the 
International Gemalogical Institute (IGI).  Sears routinely sells the jewelry below the value stated on the summary.  Each piece of Celestial Star diamond jewelry is engraved with the unique summary number that matches the certificate it comes with.  The certificate states measurements, carat weight, color, clarity, polish, and symmetry the of the diamond as well as the Sears item number, a description, and a photograph.


Celestial Star items are always changing as styles that sell are replenished, older styles are discontinued, and popular new styles are rolled out.  The current styles, especially in diamond pendants and earrings, are priced lower than those of years past and have a lower total carat weight of diamonds.  New styles focus more on clusters or multiple diamonds instead of solitaire diamonds, which allows for a lower price.


Sears markets Celestial Star diamond jewelry as their best.  Special navy blue platforms, navy blue price signs, and special signed white leatherette trim set the jewelry apart.  Celestial Star diamond jewelry is always (according to corporate mandated 
planograms) displayed at the top (furthest from the customer) of the showcase on the special displays.


Celestial Star diamond jewelry never goes on sale because it is a Great Price ( always a low price ) item, which is seen by all prices ending in 98 cents.  Celestial Star diamond jewelry is exclusively sold in Sears, Sears Essentials, and Sears Grand, as well as online at Sears.com.  The number of Celestial Star diamond jewelry styles that a Sears store carries depends on how much that particular store sells.  The line is not sold at any 

Kmart
 stores.

Lt. Annie G. Fox was the first woman to receive the 

Purple Heart
 for combat.  She served as the chief nurse in the 
Army Nurse Corps at 
Hickam Field during the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor, on 
December 7, 
1941. Fox later received the 

Bronze Star
, established by General George Washington during the Revolutionary War. This decoration originally was for  outstanding performance of duty and meritorious acts of extraordinary fidelity.  After 1932, however, the medal was usually restricted to those wounded or injured by enemy action. Although unwounded, Lieutenant Fox received her medal for  her fine example of calmness, courage, and leadership, which was of great benefit to the morale of all she came in contact with.  The citation foreshadowed the nurses' contribution to World War II.

The 
Sten (or Sten gun) was a family of 











British










, 
9 mm 
submachine guns used extensively by the 

British Empire and Commonwealth
 forces throughout 







World War II






 and the 

Korean War
.  They were notable for their simple design and comparatively low cost of production. The name STEN is an acronym, deriving from the names of the weapon's chief designers, Major Reginald Shepherd and Harold Turpin, and ENfield, the location of the 








Royal Small Arms Factory







 (RSAF) at 

Enfield Lock
 in 

London
.  Over 4 million Stens in various versions were made in the 1940s.

The official designation Carbine, Machine, Sten should not be confused with the common understanding of 
carbine; the Sten was a typical, almost stereotypical submachine gun while the term carbine is used to refer to short, light rifles.

H.M.S. Pinafore





, 1898


Ruth Vincent (
March 22 
1877   
July 4 
1955) was an 

English
 
opera singer and 
actress, best known for her performances in 
soprano roles of the 
Savoy Operas with the 


D'Oyly Carte Opera Company

.


Early life and D'Oyly Carte years


Vincent was born in Grand Yarmouth, 

Norfolk
.  Her father was Henry Vincent Bunn, and she married Lieutenant Colonel John Fraser of the 

Royal Horse Guards
. 





Vincent in 1897


Vincent joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the chorus of 






The Chieftain





 at the 

Savoy Theatre
 in 1894.  In 1895, she toured the British provinces in the chorus.  In 1896, she created the small part of Gretchen in 






The Grand Duke





 and also occasionally played the larger role of Lisa.  She sang in the chorus during the subsequent revival of 






The Mikado





 and then created the small role of Dorothea in 






His Majesty





 (by 
F. C. Burnand and 




Alexander MacKenzie



) in 1897.  She sang the role of Kate in the first revival of 






The Yeomen of the Guard





 beginning in 1897, filling in briefly in the leading role of Elsie in July of that year, then taking over the part of Elsie in August when 
Ilka Palmay left the company. 


Vincent next appeared in leading roles, including Iza in 
The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein (1897-98) and Casilda in 






The Gondoliers





 (1898), created the role of Laine in 






The Beauty Stone





 (1898), played Aline in 






The Sorcerer





 (1898), created the part of Princess Laoula in 






The Lucky Star





 (early 1899), and sang Josephine in 






H.M.S. Pinafore





 (later in 1899).  When she was passed over for the leading soprano part of Sultana Zubedyah in 






The Rose of Persia





, Vincent rejected the part that she was offered ( Scent-of-Lilies ) and left the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in November 1899.  As it turned out, 








Ellen Beach Yaw







, the American soprano cast as the Sultana, was dismissed after only two weeks in the role, and the opportunity to replace her went to young 








Isabel Jay







 instead of Vincent.  


Vincent's younger sister, Madge Vincent, was a D'Oyly Carte chorister from 1898 to 1900 and also had a subsequent musical theatre career.




West End career and later years





as Sophia in 






Tom Jones





''


Vincent did eventually get a chance to play the Sultana in New York in a 







Charles Frohman






 production at Daly's Theatre (co-starring 








John Le Hay







).  Vincent then appeared in London in 
musical theatre roles, including as Merva Sunningdale in The Medal and the Maid in 1903 (and in New York in 1904).  She played leading West End roles in 
Veronique in 1904-05 (and in New York 1905-06), A Girl on the Stage in 1906, 






Trial by Jury





 (as the Plaintiff in the 


Ellen Terry

 Jubilee celebration on June 12, 1906, Amours in 1906-07, 






Tom Jones





 (1907), The Belle of Brittany in 1909, and A Persian Princess in 1909. 


Vincent next sang with the Beecham Opera Company and then made her debut in grand opera at 




Covent Garden



 in 1910, singing in such operas as 
Hansel und Gretel, and 






Carmen





 (as Michaela), and creating the role of Vrenchen in 
Delius's opera, A Village Romeo and Juliet.  She performed a concert tour of the provinces in 1911 and sang in her first oratorio in 1912, appearing at the 1912 Hereford and 1913 Gloucester Festivals.  In her later years, she appeared mostly at the Palladium, 

Coliseum Theatre
, and other variety houses.  She was also an Associate of the Philharmonic Society.


Ruth Vincent died in London at the age of 78.




Recordings


Vincent made a number of recordings of songs for HMV and Columbia between 1904 and 1920 including  The Waltz Song  from 















Edward German














's Tom Jones.  Her voice can be heard on the CD The Art of the Savoyard (Pearl GEMM CD 9991).

Amanda Baggs (born 1980 in 

California
) is an 
autism rights activist.  In January 2007 she published a video on 

YouTube
 describing her experience as an 
autistic person entitled In My Language1 which became the subject of several articles on 

CNN
.234 She also guest-blogged about her video on 



Anderson Cooper


's blog5 and answered questions from the audience via email.6


About her video, Amanda Baggs writes:5



 

My viewpoint in the video is that of an autistic person. But the message is far broader than autistic people. It is about what kinds of communication and language and people we consider real and which ones we do not. It applies to people with severe cognitive or physical disabilities, autistic people, signing deaf people, the kid in school who finds she is not taken seriously as a student because she does not know a lot of English, and even the cat who gets treated like a living stuffed animal and not a creature with her own thoughts to communicate. It applies to anybody who gets written off because their communication is too unusual.

 





On CNN, 
Sanjay Gupta stated:



 

It really started me wondering about autism. Amanda is obviously a smart woman who is fully aware of her diagnosis of low-functioning autism, and quite frankly mocks it. She told me that because she doesn't communicate with conventional spoken word, she is written off, discarded and thought of as mentally retarded. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I sat with her in her apartment, I couldn't help but wonder how many more people like Amanda are out there, hidden, but reachable, if we just tried harder.

The 
1587 battle of Takaj , also known as Takashiro, was the first battle in 








Toyotomi Hideyoshi







's 
campaigns to seize control of Ky sh  during Japan's 





Sengoku period




.


Hideyoshi's half-brother 
Hashiba Hidenaga led 90,000 men, landing near Takaj  (Taka Castle). Within the previous several years, the 





Shimazu clan




 of 
Satsuma province had spread across the island, seizing the 
 tomo clan capital of 

Funai
. In doing so, they had become a significant power in the region, and threatened Hideyoshi's supremacy over Japan.


Hidenaga's forces pursued the Shimazu beyond Takaj , and began to besiege the fortress. 

Shimazu Iehisa
 then turned his force of 20,000 around, clashing with a detachment of 15,000 Toyotomi warriors. Three thousand Shimazu warriors dismantled the fortifications of the besiegers, and distracted them long enough to effect a cavalry attack. However, they then found themselves flanked by 1500 Toyotomi warriors, who made every effort to give the appearance of a larger force in the Shimazu's rear, cutting off their escape.


Fighting their way through the Toyotomi forces, the Shimazu effected a retreat, leaving Takaj  and the surrounding area to Hidenaga.

Live at the Village Vanguard is a 
1961 
album by 
jazz musician 





John Coltrane




. One side of the original LP was devoted to  Chasin' The Trane  which has been described as one of Coltrane's most important performances. 1 In a 1966 interview Coltrane recalled that he had  listened to 

John Gilmore
 kind of closely before I made Chasin the Trane  2


The Village Vanguard engagements were a focal point for Coltrane's partnership with Eric Dolphy. Other recordings from the concerts appeared originally on the 

Impressions
 LP. Interest in the results of that collaboration has led to subsequent extended reissues of the material - first in the 1977 issue of a double-LP of The Other Village Vanguard Tapes and then in the 1997 4-CD issue of the complete sessions.


The accuracy of Miles Mode's title and authorship has been the subject of 
some dispute.  On some releases it has been titled The Red Planet and composer credit given to 



Eric Dolphy


.

George Tolhurst (1827   
18 January 
1877) was an 

English
 
composer, resident from 1852 to 1866 in 

Australia
.

Born in 

Maidstone
, 

Kent
, George emigrated to 

Melbourne
 with his father, where he practised as a teacher of music. He returned to England in 1866, and died in 

Barnstaple
 in 1877. His one large-scale composition, the 
oratorio Ruth, was first performed in 
Prahran in 1864, and repeated in 

London
 in 1868. Though well received by early audiences, it was universally derided for bathos and technical ineptitude by the musical press, and by the twentieth century was generally regarded as the worst oratorio ever composed.1 It was revived in a re-orchestrated and abridged version at the 












Royal Albert Hall











, London in 1973, conducted by 












Antony Hopkins











.

Time in Canada
Seasonal time shifting







The time zones of the Americas and Canada



The Province of 

Saskatchewan
 observes 
Central Standard Time but, since it is geographically located in the Mountain Time Zone, is effectively on daylight saving time year round.


History


In 1912, the first law was passed that called for the use of 
standard time.  This law left the choice of 
time zone up to the municipal government.  The result was a patchwork of towns following either of the two neighbouring time zones (
Mountain Standard Time or Central Standard Time) with or without daylight saving time.


During 

World War I
 and 







World War II






, all municipalities were forced to adopt daylight saving time to save on fuel, but were not forced to adopt the same time zone.


In 1966, the Saskatchewan Provincial Government sought the help of a professional astronomer living in the province.  The Milton Study (Earl R.V. Milton - A submission to the Government of 

Saskatchewan
 regarding Time Zones in 

Saskatchewan
, 1966) a) concluded that Saskatchewan is in the Mountain Standard Time Zone, and b) suggested that the three prairie provinces (

Alberta
, Saskatchewan and 

Manitoba
) covered too much area to share a single time zone.


In 1966, based on the Milton Study, the Saskatchewan Government passed Chapter 85, to be known as the Time Act, 1966 (Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1966).  The key points of this act were:



The eastern part of Saskatchewan will permanently be one hour ahead of Mountain Standard Time (the equivalent of 
Mountain Daylight Time or Central Standard Time).


In the western part of Saskatchewan, municipal governments will still be able to choose what time zone to follow.




The only city that chose not to match the rest of Saskatchewan's time zone was the city of 

Lloydminster
 (partly in Saskatchewan, and partly in Alberta). Lloydminster chose to follow the Alberta side with a combination of Mountain Standard Time and Mountain Daylight Time zones. This may be because the Alberta side of the city did not have a choice of time zone. 

Swift Current
 and surrounding communities observed the same time as Lloydminster until 
April 30, 
1972 when they changed to match the rest of the province.




 Saskatchewan Time Zone 


 Saskatchewan  is often a drop-down option for  time zone  in computer programs, as an exception to the typical use of daylight saving time in North America.


The current wording of the Time Act says that during the entire year Saskatchewan observes  central standard time , which is defined to be  the time that is six hours behind

Greenwich time .  Which translates into Saskatchewan effectively being on DST year round. 1 In the map above, Saskatchewan is the rectangle of Central Standard Time protruding into Mountain Standard Time in 

Canada
, visually displaying that geographically, Saskatchewan is in the Mountain Time zone.

David Bradford House, in 















Washington, Pennsylvania














 was the home of 











David Bradford










 a leader of the 






Whiskey Rebellion





.


Bradford built the first stone house on South Main Street in 















Washington, Pennsylvania














 in 1788, which, by frontier standards, ranked as a mansion. The handsome stairway was solid mahogany; the mantel-pieces and other interior furnishings, imported from Philadelphia, were transported across the Alleghenies at considerable expense.


In 1959, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission assumed control of the house and supervised the restoration of its eighteenth-century design. The furnishings are those which were used at that time in Pennsylvania and would reflect Bradford's place in society. A management agreement was signed in 1982, turning the management of the Bradford House over to the Bradford House Historical Association. The museum is open from early May through mid December, giving group tours and hosting other special events.


The home was listed on the 





National Register of Historic Places




 in 1973 and was declared a 



National Historic Landmark


 in 1983.1


It is located at 175 South Main Street in Washington.


The Bradford House is owned by the 
Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission and is managed as a historic house museum by local volunteers for the Bradford House Historical Association.  The house is open for tours seasonally, and contains period furnishings and changing exhibits.

Isabella grapes must





The Isabella grape is a 
cultivar derived from the 
grape species 
Vitis Labrusca or 'fox grape' which is used for table, juice and wine production.
http://wine.appellationamerica.com/grape-varietal/Isabella.html



 Appearance   Use 



The skin of Isabella when ripened is a dark purple, almost black with a tender green-yellow flesh.  It has large well formed fruit clusters with thick bloom.  
http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/qa2.asp  It is a slip skin variety, meaning that the skin separates easily from the fruit.  The grapes are used to make wine, most notably 
















Uhudler















 and 
Fragolino.  The Isabella being of the genus Vitis x Labruscana imparts a 'foxiness' to the wine and because of this is thought to be objectionable, therefore it is not seen as a grape capable of making fine wines.  For the table the flavour is good though with the astringent tough skin and 'foxy' aroma is objectionable for some tastes. 
http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/qa2.asp




 In History 



Isabella, although popularly classified as being of Vitis Labrusca parentage, is almost certainly a cross with an unknown 
Vitis Vinifera, illustrated by the susceptibility to 
mildew and 
black rot.  It is thought that it resulted from random 
pollination when European Vitis Vinifera grapes were attempted to be established in America.
http://www.wineloverspage.com/wineguest/wgg.html#isabella


It was popularly thought to have been discovered by a Mrs Isabella Gibbs of 





Carolina




, however there is conflicting information with other sources stating it was found in 

Virginia
, 

Delaware
 and 
Europe
http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/qa2.asp


Isabella vines were heavily imported into Europe in the early 1800s and it is said that it is probably that the 
phylloxera was introduced into Europe on the roots of Isabella - Isabella having a resistance to the phylloxera. 




Modern Times



Isabella is no longer a commercially important grape as it produces poor wines due to its labrusca inheritance and is banned in the EU for commercial wine production, however it is grown throughout the former 
USSR, 










Latin America









, 








America







 and in some parts of Europe for domestic use. It is grown due to its phylloxera resistance and its cold hardiness. 
http://wine.appellationamerica.com/grape-varietal/Isabella.html




Aliases



Isabella has over 50 aliases including: Alexander, Black Cape, Borgona, Champania, Constantia, Dorchester, Framboisier, Fragola, Raisin De Cassis, Moschostaphylo, Kerkyraios, Tzortzidika and Izabella,

Unincorporated communities in Virginia
Culpeper County, Virginia





Stevensburg is a small 
rural 
unincorporated community  located at the intersection of 

Route 3
 and 
Route 663 in 

Culpeper County
, 

Virginia
, 








United States







.  Stevensburg is about 6.9 miles east of 

Culpeper
.  Stevensburg's 


ZIP code

 is 22741. The 
post office is headquartered in a 
building approximately 10 by 15 
feet, thereby making it one of the smallest post offices in America.



 History 



Stevensburg was originally called York by the 
Quakers that lived in the area.  At this time, travelers often camped in the small 
ravines in the area, known as  bottoms.   One ravine,   mile 
east of the village on the south side of present-day Route 3, gained considerable notoriety for  
lewd behavior  (according to the Quakers), and came to be known as  Wicked Bottom. 


In the mid-18th century, Salubria, a large brick 


Georgian

 manor house, was built about one half mile southeast of the village.  It still stands, and is operated by the 
Germanna Foundation.


During the winter of 1863 through 1864, Hansbrough's Ridge, a 
ridge about one mile east of the village, hosted the 
Union Army winter encampment.





The Stevensburg Post office, at about 10 by 15 feet, is one of the smallest post offices in America.






Hansbrough's Ridge is the site of the Union Encampment of 1863-1864.

Eleuterio Pagliano (
2 May, 
1826   
5 January, 
1903) was an 



Italian


 
painter of the 
Romantic period as well as an activist and fighter of the 
Risorgimento.


Biography


Pagliano was born in 











Casale Monferrato










 in the 

Kingdom of Sardinia
 and studied at the 
Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in 

Milan
. He began his artistic career with paintings in a distinctly 
Neoclassical style, but very quickly he was won over to Romanticism.


His contribution to the Risorgimento included joining the popular revolt against the 










Austrian









 garrison in Milan known as the 
cinque giornate of 1848 and fighting under 
Garibaldi in 


Rome

 in 1849 and in 








Varese







 in 1859. His artworks too, including a portrait of Garibaldi and a six meter wide painting (pictured) of the disembarkment of Garibaldi and his  

Hunters of the Alps
  at 








Sesto Calende







 on 

Lake Maggiore
, reflected his patriotic involvement in the 
Italian Wars of Independence.


In his later life Pagliano became a teacher and counted among his students the painter 
Pompeo Mariani.


Eleuterio Pagliano died in Milan at the age of 75. During his lifetime his paintings had failed to make a great stir; however, his reputation increased when, shortly after his death, an exhibition in his honour was mounted in Milan.

The

Houston Texans


 season began with the team trying to improve on their 6-10 record in 



2006


. This season marks the sixth year of existence for the Texans franchise as well as 





Reliant Stadium




.



Offseason



The offseason was dominated by rumors and speculation surrounding the future of 









David Carr








 and the Texans. 









Jake Plummer








 was a leading candidate to replace Carr until he was traded to Tampa Bay and then retired. The Texans also contacted free agent 











Jeff Garcia










 before he signed with Tampa Bay. Finally, on March 21 the Texans struck a deal with Atlanta and traded draft picks for their backup quarterback, 

Matt Schaub
. David Carr was cut on March 23 and later signed by the 









Carolina Panthers








.


Another situation of great speculation to fans was that of 





Domanick Williams




. Williams, the Texans all-time leading rusher, had a lingering knee injury that kept him side-lined for the entirety of the 2006 season. The Texans signed 





Ahman Green




 during free agency and eventually released Domanick on 
March 23, 
2007.

The Texans swapped their first-round pick in the 
2007 NFL Draft (8th overall) with the 









Atlanta Falcons








 for their first-round pick (10th overall) as part of the Matt Schaub deal. In drafting Okoye, who was 19 at the time of the draft, the Texans took the youngest player in NFL Draft history. 


The Texans also traded their second-round selections in 2007 and 2008 as part of the Schaub deal and did not choose again until the third round, when they took Jacoby Jones from Division II Lane College, the highest picked player who did not play in Division I FBS or FCS that year.


Offensive lineman Kasey Studdard (6th round) became the second Texas Longhorns player drafted by the Texans (Sloan Thomas was taken in the 7th round in 2004).

Hoping to end their season on a high note, the Texans went home and played a Week 17 AFC South rematch with the 





Jacksonville Jaguars




 (who were playing mainly with backups, due to them already clinching a playoff berth).


In the first quarter, Houston trailed early as QB 









Quinn Gray








 completed a 22-yard TD pass to WR 

Reggie Williams
 for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Texans took the lead with RB 





Ron Dayne




 getting a 2-yard TD run and QB 









Sage Rosenfels








 completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE 





Owen Daniels




.  Jacksonville would tie the game with Gray completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR 






Ernest Wilford





.  Afterwards, Houston immediately responded with WR 
Andre Davis returning a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown.


In the third quarter, the Texans increased their lead as Davis returned the second half's opening kickoff 104 yards for a touchdown.  In doing so, Davis became the 7th player in NFL history to return two kickoffs for touchdowns in the same game.  Afterwards, Houston kept its momentum going with Dayne getting a 12-yard TD run.  The Jaguars would respond with Gray complting a 5-yard TD pass to WR 









Matt Jones








.  In the fourth quarter, the Texans pulled away with RB 






Darius Walker





 getting a 1-yard TD run.  Jacksonville would end the game with Gray and Wilford hooking up with each other again on a 17-yard TD pass.


With the win, Houston finished its season at 8-8.


For the year, the Texans scored a total of 43 touchdowns and managed to get 8 wins on the year (both franchise records).

Arthur A. Bellinger




Arthur  Tony  Bellinger is a retired U.S. 
soccer 
defender who played both in the 

North American Soccer League
 and 

Major Indoor Soccer League
.  He also played seven games with the 

U.S. national team
.


Playing career


Bellinger, who grew up in Southern New Jersey, joined the 









Dallas Tornado








 of the 

North American Soccer League
 in 1977.  He quickly established himself as one of the top defenders and best U.S. players in the league.  In 1980, he signed with the expansion 









St. Louis Steamers








 of 

Major Indoor Soccer League
 for the 1980-1981 indoor season, returning to the Tornados for the 1981 NASL outdoor season.  He forewent the 1982 NASL season, but returned in 1983 with 









Team America








.  Team America was an attempt by the 
U.S. Soccer Federation to create a more stable 

national team
 program by entering the national team into the NASL as a franchise.  However, the concept failed when Team America stumbled to a 10-20 record and the bottom of the league standings.  USSF pulled the national team from the NASL at the end of the season.  Bellinger returned to the Steamers and played with them through the end of the 1986-1987 season.  In 1987, Bellinger signed a guaranteed contract with the Steamers, but broke his foot and missed the 1987-1988 season.  The Steamers folded in 1988 and Bellinger retired from playing professionally to devote himself to coaching.




National team


Bellinger earned seven 
caps with the 

U.S. national team
 from 1977 to 1980.  He scored one goal in a 3-1 loss to Guatemala on September 18, 1977, his second game with the national team.




Coaching


Tony Bellinger is the head coach for the 

Bishop Guertin High School
 (





New Hampshire




) boys varsity team, a position he has held for over 15 seasons.  He also coaches the NWC (Nashua World Cup) Boys U15 Premier team.

Tambourine Dove



The Tambourine Dove (Turtur tympanistria) is a 
pigeon which is a widespread resident breeding bird in woodlands and other thick vegetation in 






Africa





 south of the 
Sahara Desert. Its range extends from 

Senegal
 east to 

Ethiopia
 and 

Kenya
 and southwards through eastern Africa to south-eastern 

South Africa
, but it is absent from the drier areas of south-western Africa. There is a population on the 

Comoros
 Islands.

This is very much a species of thick woodlands, including dense gardens and plantations of 
castor oil, 
cocoa and 
rubber. As such, this shy species is usually seen when flushed whilst feeding on the forest floor, 
The Tambourine Dove builds a frail stick nest low in a thicket or vine tangle, and lays two cream-coloured 
eggs. Both sexes incubate, although this task is performed mainly by the female, and the eggs hatch in 13 days with another 13-14 days to fledging. The chicks are fed regurgitated food.


The Tambourine Dove is a small plump pigeon, typically 22cm in length. The male has a white face with a black spot behind the eye, white underparts and a grey crown.  Its back, hind neck, wings and tail are pale grey brown, and the folded wings have large dark purple patches. The under tail is brown. The eye ring and feet are purple-red, and the bill is purple.


The female is duller, and is white only on the belly, the face and breast being a pale grey-brown. The crown is grey-brown, without the blue-grey of the male. The juvenile resembles the female but has chestnut fringes to the feathers of the back, breast and flanks. Even in these plumages, this species is paler below than other small African doves.


The Tambourine Dove s flight is fast and agile, and it tends to stay quite low when flushed. In flight it shows chestnut primary flight feathers and under wings.


The call of this bird is a persistently repeated du-du-du-du-du.  


Tambourine Dove is usually solitary, but is sometimes seen in family groups or with 




Lemon Dove



s. It is quite terrestrial, and usually forages on the ground for seeds and small fruits. It has a preference for seeds of the 
castor oil plant. It will on occasion eat small insects and molluscs.

John Lankester Parker 
OBE 
FRAeS Hon. 
MSLAE1 (b. 1896, d. 
22 August 
1965) was Chief 
Test Pilot for 

Short Brothers
 from 1918 until his retirement in 1945. He joined Shorts in 






1916





 as a part-time test pilot and assistant to then Chief Test Pilot 
Ronald Kemp, having been recommended for the post by 
Captain, later Admiral Sir, 
Murray Sueter, 
RNAS.2 By the time he retired he was a director of the company.


First flying experience



He gained his first flying experience as a pilot flying for the 
Northern Aircraft Company based in 

Windermere
, where he worked between 1914 and 1916. It was during his time flying with the Northern Aircraft Company that he made the acquaintance of Murray Sueter, Ronald Kemp and 
Oscar Gnosspelius, all of whom would figure later in his work at Shorts.


In 1916 he joined the 
Prodger-Isaacs Syndicate of freelance test pilots, working for several British aircraft manufacturers.




Shorts


His first assignment with Shorts began on 
17 October 






1916





, when he was asked by 
Horace Short to test fly a batch of six 

Short Bomber
s from the Eastchurch airfield. In spite of his relative youth, his flying skills impressed Horace Short, who soon offered him a permanent position as assistant to Ronald Kemp. 


He became Chief Test Pilot for Short Brothers in 1918 as successor to Ronald Kemp.
Between 1918 and his last official flight as Chief Test Pilot on 
22 August 
1945 he flew every Shorts prototype on its maiden flight, ranging from the diminutive 
Short Shirl (560 lb (254 kg)) to the very large 

Short Shetland
 (75,860 lb (34,410 kg)). During the course of his long association with the company, especially during the early pioneering years, he survived numerous forced landings, both on land and on water.  


In 1943 he became a Director of Short Brothers and Harland Ltd., Belfast.3




Other activities



Parker was a long-time member of the 
Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators, serving as its Master from 1951 until 1953 and again from 1956 until 1957.4  In 1948 he was the first recipient of the Guild's Brackley Memorial Trophy,  awarded to a transport pilot(s) or navigator(s), for outstanding flying, contributing to the operational development of air transport, or transport aircraft, or of new techniques in air transport flying. 5


In memory of his long association with the Medway area, a road in 

Rochester, Kent
 was named after him.

Compositions by Sergei Rachmaninoff
Symphonic poems




Isle of the Dead, 
Op. 29 is a 
symphonic poem composed by 

















Sergei Rachmaninoff
















. Rachmaninoff was inspired by 
Arnold Bocklin's painting, 





Isle of the Dead''




, which he saw in 

Paris
 in 1907.  He concluded the composition while staying in 

Dresden
 in 1908.  It is considered a classic example of Russian late-
Romanticism of the beginning of the 20th century.

The music begins by suggesting the sound of the oars of 







Charon






 as they meet the waters of the river 
Styx.  Rachmaninoff then uses a recurring figure in 5/8 time to depict what may be the rowing of the oarsman or the movement of the water, and as in several other of his works, quotes the 













Dies Irae












 plainchant, an allusion to death. In contrast to the theme of death, the 5/8 time also depicts breathing, creating a holistic reflection on how life and death are intertwined.

Michael D. Brya (born in 
Libertyville, 





Illinois




 on 
February 17, 
1978) also known as Sheriff Scabs, is an American rock singer / songwriter / multi-instrumentalist. He is best known as a solo artist, as well as a former founding member and frontman for the legendary local 

Chicago
 rock band 
Black Cuntry Rock



Biography



Early projects and influences


Michael started playing music while attending 

Carmel High School
, a Catholic college prep school in 
Mundelein, 





Illinois




. He was heavily influenced by the works of heavy metal groups such  as 


Metallica

, 


Black Sabbath

, and 


White Zombie

. The works of these bands inspired him to teach himself to play guitar. Soon after he and three other Carmel class mates formed a punk metal band called The Ciggarettes, which mainly relied on playing covers by 
The Misfits and 
The Ramones. But around the time Michael turned 18, he had discovered industrial music- bands like 


Nine Inch Nails

, 


Ministry

, and 


Pigface

 were his new found loves and his music showed.




Angel In Black


In 1996, Michael formed a new group, one that was set in the ways of his new love for industrial, but with a darker tone. This new gothic rock group was called 
Angel In Black 1, a name that, oddly enough, was lifted from lyrics of the 

Cracker
 song 
Eurotrash Girl. Together with co-founder Ivan Niezdek (aka Christoph), Michael made extremely dark music, violent lyrics, with terrifying vocals, and devastating guitar and keyboard effects. Different variations of Angel In Black took Chicago stages through 1998, including the addition of Michael's cousin Chris Kolar on bass and drums. During Angel In Black's final show, they were joined on stage by 
Ahab Rex and Johnny Nero (of the band 
Skarred) to perform a version of 


Gary Numan

's Down In The Park. 




Sheriff Scabs and Black Cuntry Rock



Black Cuntry Rock recorded three official releases, played live concerts from December 1998 to April 2002. Scabs, Rex, and Nero were the heart of the band until the very end. 
Right Eye Rita accompanied the band through most of its existence, as well as a large rotating stock of live drummers. After the band disbanded, Scabs kept his Sheriff title, and all the members of BCR went on to continue with solo careers. Sheriff Scabs has recently begun writing new material and performing again in Chicago with new members.


The current lineup of Sheriff Scabs' live band wholey consists of former members of the Chicago industrial-metal band Fashion Bomb, including Dreg (drums), Mode (guitars), Bambi (bass), and Sheriff Scabs himself, who spent a brief period playing bass for Fashion Bomb during the summer of 2006.




Failure To Communicate Records


A year after BCR went their separate ways, Sheriff Scabs founded Failure To Communicate Records, a record label who's goal was to sign smaller, but more deserving rock artists, as well as produce tribute compilations. Through Failure To Communicate, Scabs has worked with the likes of 


The Dresden Dolls

, 



Voltaire


, 
The Arcade Fire, 
Meg Lee Chin, 







David J






 (
Bauhaus / 
Love and Rockets), 





James O'Barr




, 

The Red Paintings
, as well as the solo projects from Rex and Nero among others.


Failure To Communicate remains in operation today, with Sheriff Scabs as president of the company. They release one tribute CD a year - which the most successful to this point has been . Sheriff Scabs has begun recording his first full length album of solo material. The first single,  Deeper  and it's b-side, a cover of Nick cave and the Bad Seeds'  I Let Love In  were recorded and produced by Phil Taylor of Future Leaders of the World and John LeCompt formerly of Evanescence. The album is tentatively titled  The Deep Six Holiday  and is expected out in late 2008.




The Name


Michael did most of his promotion for Angel In Black through e-mail. Being a fan of schock rock group 






Marilyn Manson





, Michael made his e-mail address scabwings@hotmail.com (no longer active)- from the song Angel With The Scabbed Wings.
This was well known among his friends online and in real life, and before long everyone in the music world who knew him either called him Scabwings, Scabbie, or just plain Scabs. 
One night while drinking with Nero and Rex, the idea came about to start something of a super group, with Scabs on vocals, Rex on Bass, and Nero on guitar. They thought, since they were all David Bowie fans, that they should name the new group after a Bowie song. And after scrolling though the Bowie catalog, they drunkenly settled on Black Country Rock (though the  O  in country was later dropped due to a mistake in an artist's rendering of the band logo). At first, the band thought of forming this glam rock group around a country theme- cowboy hats, boots, gun holsters, chaps, mechanical bulls on stage, and the frontman would be The Sheriff. This is how the title of SHERIFF SCABS came to be.

Please

The episode starts off with Desmond, 

Hurley
, 

Jin
 and 














Charlie













 walking through the jungle, talking about superheroes, when Charlie suddenly springs one of 

Rousseau
's traps, and is consequently shot in the throat by an arrow. Desmond tries to give him aid, but Charlie dies in his arms. We then see a string of flashes - Hurley lifting a cable out of the sand, a red light dropping from the sky, Jin holding a parachute in the jungle, and a person stuck in a tree.


The view then returns to Desmond fishing on the beach, revealing that it was all one of Desmond's visions for the first time. He looks over to see that Charlie is still alive and well. Desmond approaches Hurley and asks him to take him to the cable. Hurley pretends not to know anything, but eventually Desmond coaxes him into telling him, and also asks him to go with him on a hike. The two visit 

Jack
 to pick up a first-aid kit, with Desmond telling him that he has a sprained ankle. Jack is skeptical at first, but eventually hands it over. Hurley then demands that Desmond tells him what he's up to. Desmond explains that he experienced more visions, but weren't shown in order, so everything needs to happen exactly as they appeared.


Meanwhile, 


















Kate

















 is approached by 
















Sawyer















 in her tent while she is changing, and he asks her if Jack knows about their fling while in captivity. She explains that Jack saw them having sex through the surveillance monitors. Sawyer tries flirting with her, but Kate playfully shrugs him off.




Desmond
 gets 

Hurley
 to speak with 

Jin
, who comes along after being told about a  camping trip.  Desmond then approaches 














Charlie













 with the same story, but Charlie sees through this and questions him about his visions. Desmond gives in and explains, but only a limited amount to convince Charlie to come along. They walk along the beach, up until the point where Hurley first discovered the cable. Desmond suggests that they camp out here until the next morning, causing Charlie to become wary. However, the four of them agree and enjoy a ghost story told by Jin (in Korean), while gathered around a campfire. Charlie notices Desmond is looking at the photo of him and 


Penny

. Charlie asks how he could leave someone so beautiful. Desmond replies that he is a coward. Their conversation is interrupted by the sound of an approaching helicopter. Thinking that they are being rescued, they suddenly notice the helicopter doesn't sound right, and they hear it crash into the ocean. Jin, however, spots a beacon flashing in the sky, landing somewhere in the jungle. Desmond is eager to follow, but Charlie suggests they wait until morning. Reluctantly, Desmond agrees.


Meanwhile, back at the camp, 

Kate
 and 

Jack
 have a talk in the kitchen, and reminisce about days on the island. Kate tries communicating with Jack and tries to get things back to normal between the two, but he asks to use her spoon and heads off to 

Juliet's
 tent where he eats dinner with her. Kate becomes upset, so she goes to Sawyer's tent and seduces him. The next morning, 

Desmond
, 














Charlie













, 

Jin
 and 

 Hurley
 venture off into the jungle. Charlie stumbles across a small Hawaiian doll, which at first was mistaken for one of 

Rousseau's
 traps. Desmond then discovers a rucksack wedged in a tree above Hurley, and retrieves it. Inside, they find a satellite phone, which has stopped working, and a book titled  Ardil-22  (the 

Portuguese
 translation of 


Joseph Heller

's novel 





Catch-22




). Inside, Desmond finds a perfect copy of the photograph with him and 


Penny

, causing him and Charlie to suspect that Penny is the person who parachuted on the island.




Jack
 and 

Juliet
 talk as they continue to construct her tent back on the beach. They are soon confronted by 
















Sawyer















, who challenges Jack to a game of ping-pong. As they play, Jack mentions that he and Juliet spent dinner together. When Sawyer says how strange it is to be back, Jack reveals that he spoke with Kate the night before, but ate supper with Juliet. Sawyer confronts Kate, and gives her a cassette tape (the best of Phil Collins), which he got from 

Bernard
. He then questions her about why she jumped him, asking her if she was upset about Jack and Juliet. Sawyer accuses her of using him before walking away.


Back in the jungle, 

Desmond
 and 














Charlie













 discuss his reasons for bringing them on the hike. It soon starts raining, and Desmond is eager for the group to pick up the pace. 

Hurley
 and Charlie discuss who is faster - 

Superman
 or 
The Flash - as seen in Desmond's vision at the start of the episode. As also foreseen, Charlie activates the trap that is supposed to kill him. Desmond, however, pushes him to the ground, saving his life and narrowly avoiding the arrow. Charlie immediately understands that Desmond knew it would happen.


Flashbacks in this episode show 

Desmond
 joining a monastery. He is greeted by Brother Campbell as he is putting on his robe, who welcomes him to the abbey. The two quickly get along, and on one day they are applying the labels for wine bottles. While they are talking, a monk enters and informs Desmond of a visitor. A man then enters and punches Desmond, before leaving. Desmond decides to visit an old flame, whom he was supposed to marry after six years of dating, but jilted her a week before the wedding to become a monk. Derek, the man who assaulted him, answers the door, but is quickly intervened by Ruth, Desmond's old love. She invites him in, where he explains that he was called to join the monastery. However, Ruth accuses him of being scared and yells at him for not having the decency to come clean when breaking up with a woman. Later that night, Desmond gets drunk on the wine that he helped label. Brother Campbell catches him and informs him that he is no longer welcome in the monastery. However, the next day, he asks Desmond to help load the crates of wine into the car of a client. As he wheels them out, he meets 


Penny Widmore

, who offers to take him with her.


As they continue onwards, 

Jin
 and 

Desmond
 are unable to decide which direction to go. 

Hurley
 suggests that he and 














Charlie













 go one way while Jin and Desmond go another. Charlie immediately declines and wants to go with Desmond. When they are alone, Charlie yells at Desmond for not telling him the truth about his visions, to which he responds that  it would be pointless for 

Desmond
 to save him, as it will keep happening over again , referring it to a 'test of God'. Jin suddenly calls for them, as he and Hurley have discovered the beacon and the parachutist hanging motionless from the trees. Desmond climbs the tree and cuts off the parachute, so Jin, Charlie and Hurley can use it as a safety net for when Desmond cuts the pilot free. Convinced that he will be finally reunited with Penny, Desmond quickly removes the helmet, only to discover that she is a different woman, Naomi. As the episode concludes, she mutters Desmond's name.




Production notes and continuity










Marsha Thomason's

 character was originally credited as  parachutist  in the official press release,2 before it was revised to give her character the name 


Naomi

.3


The Portuguese version of 


Joseph Heller

 novel 





Catch-22




 is found by Desmond in the parachutist's backpack. It is noteworthy that the men in contact with Penny Widmore in 

Live Together, Die Alone
 were also Portuguese-speaking. However, in one of his visions, the book's title is in English, not Portuguese.


 A  



Catch-22


  is a situation that is  no win  or is a double bind. 


When Desmond is talking to the abbot in his office, a picture of the abbot and Mrs. Hawking (introduced in  

Flashes Before Your Eyes
 ) is seen on the abbot's desk.


As Charlie, Desmond, Hurley and Jin are walking along a beach they are all whistling the  

Colonel Bogey March
  in tandem, recreating a famous scene from the film  
Bridge on the River Kwai.  


The song Desmond sings when he is drinking wine in the abbey is  




The Celtic Song



  as sung by 

Celtic F.C.
 supporters.


The number of cases of wine the monks made is 108, which's the sum of the numbers 
4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42.


Hurley and Charlie discuss who is faster - 

Superman
 or 

The Flash
. In the  episode Speed Demons in which Superman and The Flash compete in a charity running race around the world, but have to stop to deal with the 


Weather Wizard

. After defeating him, they continue to race and the episode ends with a cliffhanger. Later in an episode in 

Justice League Unlimited
,  
Flash and Substance,  in the 
Flash Museum there is a globe with miniature Flash and Superman racing around it and a plaque that reads  The Fastest Man Alive  as a reference to the  episode in which the Flash was introduced, and the thing telling us that Flash is the winner from the race.


 Desmond claims his visions are not always correct in every detail when showing what is going to happen, which seems to be true. In his vision when Charlie asks if there are any other restrictions about Superman he need to know about, his last word before he dies is  Kryptonite . When Charlie finally steps on the trap for real, he is able to complete his line, which include two more words;  ballet slippers .


 In Desmond's flash Charlie can clearly be seen holding the parachute following his death - this turns out to be true as Desmond saves him.

48th Armored Medical Battalion




The 48th Armored Medical Battalion was an American military medical/surgical unit attached to the 

2nd Armored Division
 throughout 







World War II






.  The 48th participated in the invasions of 






North Africa





, 

Sicily
 and 
Normandy.

The unit was formed on 





July 15




, 
1940 under the command of Col. Abner Zehm.  In February 1942, Major John S. Wier became the Battalion Commander.


Major Wier requested surgical trucks for the unit.  The army gave him six thousand dollars, enough for six 

2  ton trucks
 to be converted for medical use.


On 
December 11, 
1942 the 48th left 

Fort Dix
, New Jersey for North Africa, landing at 

Casablanca
 on 
December 24, 
1942.


In the spring of 1943 they proceeded to 

Arzew
 in 

Algeria
, then on to 

Tunis
.  On to 

Sicily
 and then to 

Tidworth
 Barracks, 

England
 for an extended period of time.


The battalion landed on 

Omaha Beach
 on 
June 9, 
1944 (D+3) at 1:00PM.  The battalion stayed with the 2nd Armored Division throughout the advance on into Germany and then to Berlin.


After the war the unit returned to 
Camp Hood, Texas for retraining before being disbanded.


The Battalion s WWII unit insignia consisted of a 
rod of Asclepius crossed with a dagger, on a silver bordered, red shield.


At a later date the 48th Medical Battalion was reformed, again as part of the 2nd Armored Division, serving until the divisions disbandment in 1991.

Dollar




The dollar was the currency of 
Nevis until 1830. The currency comprised of counterstamped Spanish and French colonial coins. The dollar was subdivided into 72 black dogs, each of 1  pence. Around 1801, coins were issued for 1, 4, 6, 7 and 9 black dogs with the word  Nevis  and the denomination stamped on them. The 1 black dog coins were countermarked on 

French Guiana
n 2 
sous, whilst the 9 black dogs were made from Spanish colonial 1 




real



 coins. In 1830, sterling was established as the official currency of the island.

Since 1935, dollars have once more circulated on Nevis, first the 
British West Indies dollar, then the 

East Caribbean dollar
.

Ancient Philosophy





Heraclitus

, an ancient Greek philosopher, was the first to suggest this unity of opposites. Philosophers had for some time been contemplating the notion of opposites. 


Anaximander

 posited that every element was an opposite, or connected to an opposite (water is cold, fire is hot). Thus,  the material world was composed by some indefinite, boundless 


apeiron

 from which arose the 
elements (earth, air, fire, water) and pairs of opposites (hot/cold, wet/dry). There was, according to Anaximander, a continual war of opposites.

Anaximenes, a student and successor of Anaximander, replaced this indefinite, boundless 
arche with air, a known element with neutral properties. According to Anaximenes, there was not so much a war of opposites, as a continuum of change.
Heraclitus, however, did not accept the 
milesian 
monism and replaced their underling material arche with a single, divine law of the universe, which he called 
logos. The universe of Heraclitus is in constant change, but also remaining the same. That is to say, an object moves from point A to point B, thus creating a change, but the underlying law remains the same. Thus, a unity of opposites is present in the universe as difference and sameness. This is a rather broad example though. For a more detailed example we may turn to an 
aphorism of 


Heraclitus

:


 The road up and the road down are the same thing  (Hippolytus, Refutations 9.10.3)


This is an example of a compresent unity of opposites. For, at the same time, this slanted road has the opposite qualities of ascension and descention.  According to Heraclitus, every object co-instantiates at least one pair of opposites (though not necessarily in simultaneously) and every pair of opposites is co-instantiated in at least one object. 
Heraclitus also uses the succession of opposites as a base for change:


 Cold things grow hot, a thing cold, a moist thing withers, a parched thing is wetted. 


As a single object persists through opposite properties, this object undergoes change.




Modern Philosophy


Unity of opposites is the central category of 
dialectics, and it is viewed sometimes as a 
metaphysical concept, a 
philosophical concept or a 
scientific concept. 
It defines a situation in which the existence or identity of a thing (or situation) depends on the co-existence of at least two conditions which are opposite to each other, yet dependent on each other and presupposing each other, within a field of tension. 


In 
formal logic and 
mathematics, a unity or identity of opposites cannot exist (it would mean for example that 2 = -2), but dialecticians claim that it can exist in reality or in thought. If the opposites were completely balanced, the result would be 
stasis, but often it is implied that one of the pairs of opposites is larger, stronger or more powerful than the other, such that over time, one of the opposed conditions prevails over the other.


In his criticism of 


Immanuel Kant

, the German philosopher 
Hegel who tried to systematise dialectical understandings thus wrote: 


The principles of the metaphysical philosophy gave rise to the belief that, when cognition lapsed into contradictions, it was a mere accidental aberration, due to some subjective mistake in argument and inference. According to Kant, however, thought has a natural tendency to issue in 
contradictions or 
antinomies, whenever it seeks to apprehend the infinite. We have in the latter part of the above paragraph referred to the philosophical importance of the antinomies of 
reason, and shown how the recognition of their existence helped largely to get rid of the rigid dogmatism of the metaphysic of understanding, and to direct attention to the Dialectical movement of thought. But here too Kant, as we must add, never got beyond the negative result that the thing-in-itself is unknowable, and never penetrated to the discovery of what the antinomies really and positively mean. That true and positive meaning of the antinomies is this: that every actual thing involves a coexistence of opposed elements. Consequently to know, or, in other words, to comprehend an object is equivalent to being conscious of it as a concrete unity of opposed determinations. The old metaphysic, as we have already seen, when it studied the objects of which it sought a metaphysical knowledge, went to work by applying categories abstractly and to the exclusion of their opposites. 
http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL48n




In his philosophy, Hegel ventured to describe quite a few cases of  unity of opposites , including the concepts of 
Finite and 
Infinite, 
Force and 
Matter, 
Identity and 
Difference, 
Positive and 
Negative, 
Form and 
Content, 
Chance and 
Necessity, 
Cause and 
Effect, 
Freedom and 
Necessity, 
Subjectivity and 
Objectivity, 
Means and 
Ends, 
Subject and 
Object, and 
Abstract and 
Concrete.

Eric Girard Yelding (born 
February 22, 
1965 in 
Montrose, Alabama), is a former 
Major League baseball player who was with the 




Houston Astros



 and 













Chicago Cubs












 from 
1989-
1993. Known for his blazing speed and strong arm, he played primarily 
centerfield and 
shortstop.



Minor Leagues


Young was a star athlete at 

Fairhope High School
 in 

Fairhope, Alabama
 and was later drafted in the 1th round of the 
1984 MLB amateur draft out of 

Chipola College
 by the 




Toronto Blue Jays



. He made an immediate impact with his speed and arm, stealing 93 bases and adding 19 outfield assists in his first 200 games at 

Medicine Hat
 and 
Kinston. Because of his strong arm, he was moved to shortstop the following season at 







Ventura County






. Although he found success with the bat and on the basepaths, hitting .280 with 41 steals, he made an astounding 58 fielding errors. He spent the 
1987 year between 

Myrtle Beach
 and Double-A 
Knoxville, where he stole a combined 83 bases, though his fielding did not improve as he made another 59 errors. Despite being a liability in the field, his prowess on the basepaths earned him a promotion to AAA 








Syracuse







 where he was moved to second base in an attempt to alleviate his fielding woes. Although his play in the field was still suspect, he did cut his season error total down to 35 while hitting .250 and stealing 59 bases for the Chiefs.




Major Leagues



Houston Astros


On 
December 5, 
1988 Yelding was selected by the Chicago Cubs from Toronto in the 
Rule V Draft. He was waived by the Cubs and selected off waivers by the Houston Astros the following April. In order to satisfy the Rule V terms, the Astros were mandated to either keep Yelding on the Major League club for the entire season or forfeit their rights to him. Faced with the dilemma of having a player not yet ready for everyday play on their roster, but not wanting to lose their rights to what they considered a future star, the Astros used Yelding primarily as a pinch hitter and pinch runner. He appeared in 70 games, but played the field in only 38 of them and recorded less than 100 plate appearances.


The Astros' patience with Yelding paid early dividends, as he became their full-time leadoff hitter in 
1990 and finished second in the National League with 64 stolen bases. Though he improved and even showed flashes of brilliance in the field, his defense was still subpar though he did show his versatility by appearing at second base, third base, shortstop, and in the outfield. 


Unfortunately, 1990 would be his last full season in the major leagues. He missed half on 
1991 due to injury and struggled when healthy. He had only 8 at-bats for the Astros in 
1992, spending most of the season at AAA 







Tucson






. On 
July 10, 1992, he was traded to the 










Chicago White Sox









 in exchange for Rich Scheid. He finished the 1992 season at 




Vancouver



 before being released by the White Sox at the end of the season. He was signed by the 










Cincinnati Reds









 during the winter, but released during the 1993 
spring training before being signed for the second time by the Chicago Cubs.




Chicago Cubs


Yelding was used by the Cubs primarily as a utility infielder and pinch hitter/runner. Although his fielding had greatly improved since his early days with the Astros (only 2 errors in 32 games at second base in '93), he struggled with the bat, hitting only .204. He missed a large part of the 1993 season due to injury, as well as the following year, in which he appeared in only 29 games with the 








Iowa Cubs







.


Yelding spent 
1995 and 
1996 in the 




Cleveland Indians



 and 


Seattle Mariners

 minor league systems. He would never appear in another major league baseball game, although he did play in spring training as a replacement player for the 




Cleveland Indians



 during the 











1994 Major League Baseball strike










.

hardcore punk
music of Philadelphia




Philadelphia hardcore is 
hardcore punk created in 

Philadelphia
, the associated 
subculture.

Because of its location, Philadelphia was an easy place for bands from New York and Washington, DC to play concerts. Venues such as the Love Club, East Side Club, Long march, Community Education Center (CEC), Abe's Steaks (a small sub shop), and later on The Kennel Club, staged concerts by hardcore bands such as: Bad Brains, Circle Jerks, SSD, Minor Threat, and Black Flag. The local hardcore scene drew from the city as well as South Jersey, North to Allentown and the surrounding suburbs.


An important source of exposing the Philadelphia region to this music was the DJ Jeff Jenkins at 

WKDU
, 91.7 FM, 

Drexel University
's radio station and Eddie  Hacksaw  and Lee Paris at 

University of Pennsylvania
's 

WXPN
, 88.5 FM. Music by some of the early Philadelphia hardcore bands where included on the 1982 compilation LP Get Off My Back.1

The Dodge Viper is a 
V10-powered 
sports car manufactured by the 
Dodge division of 
Chrysler LLC. Production of the two seat sports car began at 
New Mack Assembly in 1992 and moved to its current home at 





Conner Avenue Assembly




 in October 1995. The car, as well as numerous variations of it, has made countless appearances in TV shows, video games, movies, and music videos.


Development


The Viper was conceived as a historical take on the classic American 
sports car. The iconic 









AC Cobra








 was a source of inspiration, and the final version of the Viper bears this out with its powerful engine, minimalist straightforward design, muscular and aggressive styling, and high performance. Some saw claims to kinship with the Cobra as a 
marketing exercise, ignoring that 









Carroll Shelby








 was heavily involved in the initial design of the Viper, and subsequent design of the Viper GTS coupe. Notably, the later (1996 through 2002) Viper GTS coupe took a few design cues from the 




Peter Brock



 designed Shelby Cobra Daytona. Though the proportions seem similar at first glance, the designs are quite unique. Carrol Shelby was key in the development of the R/T 10 as well as having a hand in the development of the GTS model.


The Viper was initially conceived in late 1988 at Chrysler's Advanced Design Studios. The following February, Chrysler president 
Bob Lutz suggested to Tom Gale at Chrysler Design that the company should consider producing a modern Cobra, and a clay model was presented to Lutz a few months later. The car appeared as a 









concept








 at the 







North American International Auto Show






 in 1989. This concept vehicle was originally named Copperhead because of its low, wide appearance characteristic of reptiles. All engines for the Viper have since been known as  copperhead . The name would later be changed to Viper. Public reaction was so enthusiastic, that chief engineer Roy Sjeoberg was directed to develop it as a standard 
production vehicle.


Sjoberg selected 85 engineers to be  Team Viper , with development beginning in March 1989. The team asked the then-Chrysler subsidiary 

Lamborghini
 to cast some prototype aluminum blocks based on Dodge's 
V10 truck engine for sports car use in May. The production body was completed in the fall, with a chassis prototype running in December. Though a 
V8 was first used in the 
test mule, the V10, which the production car was meant to use, was ready in February 1990.


Official approval from Chrysler chairman 



Lee Iacocca


 came in May 1990. One year later, Carroll Shelby piloted a 
pre-production car as the 











pace vehicle










 in the 





Indianapolis 500




 race. In November 1991, the car was released to reviewers with first retail shipments beginning in January 1992.




First generation SR (1992 1995)



The first prototype was tested in December 1989. It debuted in 1991 with two 
pre-production models as the 











pace car










 for the 





Indianapolis 500




 when Dodge was forced to substitute it in place of the 
Japanese-built 









Stealth








 due to complaints from the 

UAW
, and went on sale in January 1992 as the soft roofed RT/10 Roadster.


The centerpiece of the car was its 
engine. It was based on the 






Chrysler LA design





, which was a truck engine. The original configuration made it too heavy for sports car use, so 

Lamborghini
, then owned by Chrysler Corporation, revamped Dodge's 
cast-iron block 
V10 for the Viper by recasting the block and head in 
aluminum 
alloy. Some within Chrysler felt the 
pushrod two-valve design, while adequate for the truck application, was unsuitable for a performance car and suggested a more comprehensive redesign which would have included four valves per cylinder. Chrysler, however, was uncertain about the Viper's production costs and sales potential and so declined to provide the budget for the modification.


The engine weighed 711 lb (323 kg) and produced 400 hp (298 kW) at 4600 rpm and 465 lb ft (630 N m) of torque at 3600 rpm, and thanks to the long-gearing allowed by the engine, provided fuel economy at an 
EPA-rated 12 mpg (U.S.) (20 l/100 km) city and 20 mpg (U.S.) (12 l/100 km) highway.1 The body was a tubular 
steel frame with resin transfer molding (RTM) 
fiberglass panels. Some small bits of the suspension, (
tie-rod ends and parts of the front wheel hubs) following the manufacturer's  engine first  mantra, was sourced from the 

Dodge Dakota
 
pickup. It had a curb weight of 3280 lb (1488 kg) and lacked all modern driver aids such as 
traction control or 
anti-lock brakes. 
Car and Driver magazine referred to this generation as  the world's biggest 
Fat Boy 
Harley , and likened driving it to  playing ping pong with a 
Louisville Slugger baseball bat.  Despite this, in straight line performance, it completed a quarter mile in 12.6 seconds and had a maximum speed of over 180 mph (290 km/h). Its large tires allowed the car to average close to 1 lateral g in corners, placing it among the elite cars of its day. However, the car proved tricky to drive at high speeds, particularly for the unskilled.


The car is spartan, although it features inflatable lumbar support and adjustable seats. Along with the absence of exterior door handles, the vehicle lacked side windows and a roof. Although a soft top cover was available, it was designed primarily for outdoor vehicle storage. Side curtains of fabric and clear plastic operated by zippers could be inserted into the door and hand-bolted when needed. All of these decisions were made to reduce weight. The battery is located in the sealed compartment over the rear wheel well to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the soft top is removable and folds to fit in the trunk). In 1994 A/C was added as an option.

Second generation SR (1996 2002)



A 
coupe model called the GTS was also introduced in 1996. Dubbed  dubble bubble , the roof featured slightly raised sections above each seat to accommodate usage of helmets, a throwback to its intended purpose. Indeed, the Viper's performance has made the vehicle popular for both amateur and professional racers. Vipers can be seen participating often in 
drag racing, 
road racing and 
drifting. The GTS, like its predecessor, was chosen as the pace car for the 1996 





Indianapolis 500




.


Despite its similar outward appearance, the car was distinct enough to be considered a new generation model. Extensive modifications such as a reworked engine with higher power and less weight,  an almost completely redesigned chassis that was made 60 lb (27 kg) lighter and 25% stiffer in torsional rigidity through meticulous computer analysis, a thoroughly redesigned suspension, and reduced braking distances; the 1996 to 2002 Viper GTS had a lighter (approximately 650 lb) 450 bhp (336 
kW) engine, which could complete the quarter mile 0.3 seconds and 8 mph (13 km/h) faster, and increased top speed by 11 mph (18 km/h) or so. The revised suspension, stiffer chassis, and aerodynamic body raised lateral grip to 0.98 g (9.6 m/s ), although other reports show the 1992 model with 1.0 g. Contemporary tires have improved upon this measure significantly. Slalom runs could often reach or exceed 70 mph (110 km/h). Brakes once again lacked ABS initially, and proved to be the car's weakest point. The brakes cost the car in numerous comparison tests, such as a 1997  supercar comparison  by Motortrend, in which the Viper GTS placed at the top against cars such as the 

Ferrari 550
, 

Chevrolet Corvette
, 
Porsche 911, and 

Honda NSX
 in all performance exercises except braking. The car not only placed last, but had considerably longer stopping distances than other vehicles. ABS was introduced further into the production run, though braking performance was not necessarily significantly improved. In a Sports Car International comparison conducted in 2002, the Viper ACR (with ABS) was compared to the 911 GT2 at Thunderhill Raceway Park. Both cars were very capable, and quick around the test track, but the Viper proved more difficult to drive, and the braking system was blamed very specifically for the gap in lap times (approximately GT2: 2 minutes, ACR: 2:04) between the two cars.


Along with the updated performance came the inclusion of some of the  luxuries  the car did without before. Dual front airbags were added to the vehicle's safety equipment list in 1996 on the GTS and 1997 on the R/T10 as mandated by the government. The car was also exported to Europe, where it was rebadged as a Chrysler, and sold under this marque from 1997 to 2003. European models had a detuned version of the Copperhead V10.


In the first six years of production almost 10,000 Vipers were sold.
Minor evolutionary changes including new 18  diameter wheels and were introduced in the 1999 model. Subsequent versions featured light-weight 
hypereutectic pistons and an improved exhaust system, side exhaust having been dropped part way through production year 1996 for the RT/10, all production GTS Viper Coupes had rear exit exhaust. 1999 saw the introduction of the Cognac Connolly interior package. Continuing the refinements, ABS was introduced in 2001. In 2002, the end of second generation production was celebrated with the release of 360 commemorative  Final Edition  models. These models were painted red with white stripes, paying tribute to the famous race-winning Oreca cars.

Third generation ZB (2003-2006)



The Dodge Viper underwent a major redesign in 2003, courtesy of DaimlerChrysler's 
Street and Racing Technology group. The new Viper SRT-10 was heavily restyled with sharp, angled bodywork. The engine's displacement was enlarged to 8.3 L (505 
cid/8,285 cc)8 which, with other upgrades, combined to increase output to 500 hp (370 kW) and 525 lb ft (712 N m) of torque. Along with the power increases, weight was reduced into the 500 lb (230 kg) range. The chassis was also improved. It became more rigid and weighed approximately 80 pounds less than the previous model. An even lighter and stronger chassis was planned, but was abandoned because of cost. It is unlikely that the cost increase would have reduced the car's performance value, as it was already one of the fastest cars under $300,000. Parts from the planned suspension were used in the 
Hennessey Viper Venom 1000 Twin Turbo, however. The initial model was a convertible. In 2004, Dodge introduced a limited edition Mamba package. Mamba edition cars featured black interiors, with red stitching and trim and saw their MSRP price rise by roughly $3000. 200 Mambas were produced.


The new Viper SRT-10 Coupe was introduced in 2005, at the 
Detroit Auto Show, as a 2006 model. It shares many of its body panels with the convertible but takes its side and rear styling cues from the Competition Coupe. The new coupe looks much like the previous Viper GTS and retains the  double-bubble  roof shape of the original, along with the original GTS's taillights as well offering the original Viper Blue paint scheme with white stripes (referred to as GTS Blue) for an added homage to the original Viper coupe. The engine was also certified by the SAE to produce 510 hp (380 kW) and 535 lb ft (725 N m) of torque. It is important to note that the engine makes the same power as before, only the numerical value of the power was changed. Unlike the original coupe, the chassis was not modified. This made the new coupe heavier than the convertible, and thus slightly slower in low speed acceleration. Handling and high speed performance were improved by the coupe's stiffer frame, reduced drag, and increased downforce.


No 2007 model Vipers were produced. Instead, Chrysler chose to give the 2006 model an extended run while preparing the updated 2008 model.

 Fourth generation ZB (2008 present) 



In 2008, with the introduction of the 8.4 L V10, the Viper received a 90 hp (67 kW) bump up to 600 hp (450 kW), a 25 lb ft (34 N m) torque bump up to 560 lb ft (759 N m) and the engine displacement was increased up to 510.0 cubic inches (8,383 cc) from 505.6 CID (8,285 cc) of the 8.3 L engine, also receiving better flowing heads with larger valves, Mechadyne cam-in-cam 
variable valve timing on the exhaust cam lobes, and dual electronic throttle bodies.98 The rev limit was able to be increased by 300 rpm due to the improved valve-train stability from both the new camshaft profiles and valve-springs. The development of the engine was done with some external assistance from McLaren Automotive and 
Ricardo Consulting Engineers. Electronic engine control is developed by Continental AG, the controller is capable of monitoring the crankshaft and cylinder position up to six times during each firing and has 10 times more processing power compared to the previous unit.


Changes outside of the engine were less extreme, but still influential. The Tremec T56 transmission has been replaced with a new Tremec TR6060 which now has triple first gear synchronizers and doubles for higher gears.  Shifts are claimed to be 18% quicker than the 2006-2007 Chevrolet Corvette Z06. The Dana M44-4 rear axle from the 2003-2006 model now has a 

GKN
 ViscoLok speed-sensing limited-slip differential that greatly helps the tires in getting grip under acceleration. Another performance upgrade was the removal of run-flat tires; the new 

Michelin
 Pilot Sport 2 tires have increased driver feedback as well as grip and, along with revised suspension (springs, anti-roll bars, and shock valving), has made the Viper more neutral in cornering.


The modifications made to the 2008 model year car were enough for Chrysler to make it distinct from the first SRT-10, and the 2008 model became known as Gen IV, just in time for release with Chevrolet's 620 hp (460 kW) Corvette ZR1. Another notable change is the reworking of the exhaust system, previous third generation Vipers had their exhaust crossover under the seats which resulted in a large amount of heat going into the cockpit, this was done initially to help improve the cars exhaust note, since the first 2 generations of Viper, which had no crossover, were criticized for their lackluster exhaust notes. For 2008, the Viper exhaust will utilize a new exhaust system with no crossover, reducing the heat that enters the cockpit, but allowing the Viper to still produce an exotic sound.





2008 Dodge Viper from the Montreal Auto Show



The electrical system has been completely revised for 2008.  Changes include a 180-amp alternator, twin electric cooling fans, electronic throttles, and completely new VENOM engine management system.  CAN bus architecture has been intertwined with pre-existing systems to allow for regulatory compliance.  The fuel system was upgraded to include a higher capacity fuel pump and filtration system.10



Car and Driver recently tested the car and got a 0-60 mph time of 3.5 seconds, a 0-100 mph time of 7.6 seconds and a Quarter Mile-time of 11.5 seconds at 129 mph (208 km/h).11 Dodge's claims for top speed are 197 mph (317 km/h) and 202 mph (325 km/h), for the Roadster and Coupe respectively. Car and Driver also tested the Viper's track performance, and managed a fast sub 3 minute lap time around Virginia International Raceway. The Viper's time, despite hot weather, was faster than the 
Corvette Z06, 

Ford GT
, 
Porsche 911 Turbo and 911 GT3, 

Audi R8
, and other such cars. According to Car and Driver and 










Motor Trend









, the car's slightly adjusted suspension setup and new differential gave it cornering ability as sharp as before with even better control, feedback, and response.

Europe


The second generation Vipers were exported to Europe, where they were sold as Chryslers. 


The third generation Viper was being sold in Europe during 2005-2006, the first model to be sold as a Dodge, as part of Chrysler's new sales strategy for the European market. In the United Kingdom it is referred to as a Viper, but it is actually sold as the Dodge SRT-10, as the Viper name is a registered trademark in the UK. 12 

Prodrive
 currently handles the importation and modification of Vipers to meet European laws.




Variants



Viper GT2


In order to meet 
FIA homologation requirements as well as to celebrate Chrysler winning the 



1997 FIA GT2 class championship


, 100 modified Viper GT2 Championship Edition street legal cars were sold.  These upgraded GTS cars were rated at 460 hp (343 kW) and 500 
lb ft (678 N m) of 
torque.  It featured bodywork aesthetically similar to the GTS-R with its paint job, aerodynamics package, and visual options in order to publicize the Viper's achievement in the 
FIA GT Championship.13




Viper ACR


The American Club Racing (ACR) model was introduced in 1999. This model featured suspension and engine enhancements focused on maximizing performance in road racing and autocross environments. Horsepower was (by way of K N air filters and smooth intake tubes) bumped to 460 hp (343 kW) in these models, while torque went to 500 lb ft (678 N m). Weight was reduced by over 50 pounds (23 kg) by stripping the interior and removing other non essential items such as the fog lamps. The new stiffer, adjustable suspension removed another 14 pounds (6.4 kg) Along with engine and handling mods, these models are distinguished by an  ACR  badge, along with 20 spoke BBS wheels.


A new ACR was added to the Viper line up after the 2008 model year. Its upgrades are more drastic than the original, including street legal racing tires, two piece brake rotors, adjustable suspension, and significant aerodynamic revision. No engine modifications were made, so figures remain at 600 hp (448 kW) and 560 lb ft (760 N m) as in the base car. The ACR gives an advantage of being street legal. The ACR is similar to the MOPAR Viper that Dodge displayed at various auto shows. Weight is also decreased by as much as 80 lb (36 kg) by way of the  Hardcore Package  which deletes radio, speakers, amplifier, trunk carpet, hood pad and tire inflator. Its aerodynamic upgrades produce 1000 
lbf (4.4 
kN) of down-force at 150 mph (240 km/h), or roughly 10 times the downforce the stock Viper can produce at the same speed. No upgrades were given to the interior except for the addition of a professional beacon-tripped lap timer.


The Vipers ACR is built along side the standard SRT-10 at the Conner Avenue plant in Detroit.  The aerodynamic components are produced and assembled to the vehicle by Prefix Corporation located in Rochester Hills, Michigan.14


The 2009 Viper SRT-10 ACR currently holds the fastest 
Nurburgring lap time set by a production car with a time 7:22.1.




Mopar Concept Coupe

Detroit Auto Show



A prototype 2008 
Mopar Viper Coupe appeared at the 2007 







North American International Auto Show






.  There are currently no plans for production. This concept appears to have been a sneak peak at the Viper ACR.  Performance parts from this car may eventually be available for sale through 
Mopar.




Hennessey Viper Venom 1000


The Hennessey Viper is a 


modified version

 of the Dodge Viper with an 8.5-liter Venom 1000 Twin Turbo V-10 engine producing 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) and 1,100 lb*ft (1489.71 Nm) of torque. It goes from 0-60 mph in 2.9 seconds and has an estimated top speed of 255 mph (410 km/h).




Firepower





Main article: 









Chrysler Firepower










The 









Chrysler Firepower








 was a grand touring concept based on the Viper chassis that would have been equipped with the Hemi V-8.  The pricing would have targeted a slightly less affluent buyer, or one desiring an automatic transmission.




Copperhead









Main article: 









Dodge Copperhead










The 









Dodge Copperhead








 was a concept car based on the Viper platform that was intended as a cheaper, more nimble car.  It was powered by a V6 engine instead of the Viper's V10.  It never reached production.

 Production end or Possible Sale 


Major automotive media outlets have speculated the Viper will be discontinued after the 2011 model year16 and that Chrysler will close 





Conner Avenue Assembly




.17 Though Chrysler had not yet officially commented on the issue, the 25,000th Viper is owned by 

Kurt Busch
 and the milestone was commemorated by 
Bob Nardelli, Chrysler LLC Chairman, in a ceremony at the Conner plant in March 2008.18


Another possibility is selling the Viper as its own brand to a private company.  Chrysler, and its owner, Cerberus, claim to have prospective but unnamed buyers as of September 2008.19




Motorsports


Following the release of the Viper in 1992, several North American and European teams attempted to race Viper RT/10s.  Based on production cars and using an added roof for rigidity, the cars were not able to perform as hoped.  Although they were never officially backed by Dodge, they got the company interested in developing a fully-backed race car by time the second generation Viper was under development.



Viper GTS-R

Main article: 




Chrysler Viper GTS-R





Based on the Viper GTS, the GTS-R was launched in late 1995 as an attempt to prove the capabilities of the Viper design worldwide, although the racing programs would mostly concentrate on Europe.  Using such production engine components as the block, cylinder heads, and crankshaft, Dodge engineers were able to extract up to 750 hp (559 kW) from the normally 450 hp (336 kW) second generation 8.0 L V10 engine.  The chassis was re-engineered from the ground up by British sports manufacturer 






Reynard Motorsport





's Special Projects Division under chief engineer Paul Brown, while 






Oreca





 would assemble and maintain the racing cars.  


The car made its competition debut in the 1996 









24 Hours of Daytona








 with Canaska Racing, followed by Oreca in the 
BPR Global GT Series.  Oreca would go on to take most of the success with the Viper, winning the 
FIA GT Championship three times, 

24 Hours of Le Mans
 class wins three times, and an overall win at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2000.


Following the end of official factory support for the program in 2001, Vipers have been used by privateer teams with much success.  Viper GTS-Rs continued to be used competitively even into 2007.




Viper Competition Coupe





A Viper Competition Coupe competing in the 
FIA GT3 European Championship.



As of 2003, a special, non-street legal Viper SRT-10 Competition Coupe is available from Dodge for race car drivers, picking up where the GTS-R racing variant left off. The power and torque ratings have been improved, along with the vehicle being stripped of anything not essential for racing, such as the interior body panels, carpet, instrumentation, air conditioning, and stereo systems which lightened the car by 380 lb (170 kg). The Competition Coupe comes equipped with a full roll cage, a 
racing fuel cell, and other racing-related equipment. It is not sold through dealers and is purchased from Dodge directly as, essentially, a very expensive race car component. Pricing is approximately US$139,000. The Viper Competition Coupe sees action in the highly competitive 






SCCA Speed GT World Challenge





.


In 2004 
Samuel Hubinette used a Competition Coupe with a modified rear axle for the 
Formula D, in which he won the title before the car was barred by the end of the season (due to the fact FD would adopt 

D1 Grand Prix
 regulations from the following year which had already prohibited the car from competing) and was replaced by an SRT-10 the following season.


After a few one-off entries in the 



Spa 24 Hours


, from 2006, the Viper Competition Coupe raced in Europe fulltime for the first time, joining the new 
FIA GT3 European Championship with the Italian team Racing Box. At the end of the year, Oreca announced the development of a package transforming the car to GT2 regulations in national championships.


The 
Primetime Race Group use a Viper Competition Coupe in the 

American Le Mans Series
 in the GT2 class. They began racing in the end of the 



2007 American Le Mans Series season


. For the 



2008 American Le Mans Series season


 they're racing full-time with 
Hankook Tires. The cars best result was a 5th place in the GT2 class at the 





2008 12 Hours of Sebring




.

Al Sobotka (born 
October 16, 
1953) is the building operations manager for 








Olympia Entertainment







. This includes both 





Joe Louis Arena




 and 

Cobo Hall
.1 Sobotka is known mostly for driving the 
Zamboni during Detroit Red Wings games for the past 30 years and for collecting the 
octopuses thrown on the ice during Red Wings playoff games. The 

official mascot of the Red Wings
 is named after Sobotka. Sobotka came in second with 97,261 votes in Zamboni News' 1999 Zamboni  Driver of the Year  Award. 2


 
I wanna drive the Zamboni 


Sobotka has been driving the Zamboni between periods at Joe Louis Arena for almost 30 years. He takes great pride in his work and always makes sure the ice surface is up to par:






 

You know I'm particular, so if I see anything that's wrong -- a little chip of snow or something, you know, all that stuff matters a lot, 'cause a little snow can freeze and a guy hits it, never know what can happen, you know?

 





When 


Brendan Shanahan

 played for the Red Wings he had some nice words for Sobotka: 






 

Al's very good and he takes it personally. I mean we see him a lot. Everybody knows Al. We're able to go out and make comments to him. He'll know when there's a tough night, you know, in the playoffs, or if it's a humid day and he'll respond accordingly. He'll ask the players after the game, 'What'd you think of the ice?'

 





When asked about going out and driving the Zamboni in front of 20,066 Joe Louis Arena fans, Sobotka responded by saying:





 

 Well, some people are a little shy about it and ah, can't handle it I guess... I guess I [got]accustomed to it, over all these years.

 





Detroit fans even show up way before games time to watch Al do his stuff. Also, kids can compete to drive around with Al between periods. They learn that driving a Zamboni is no quick study. It's a science and an art that can take years to perfect.3


Sobotka started driving the Zamboni early in life, and when asked about his  dream job , he had this to say:





 

  It was just a job I got when I was in high school, and I kept at it, working in the maintenance department for a few years, [and]I still enjoy getting up in the morning. If you don't enjoy your work, it's hard getting up in the morning, you know? 4

 







Dealing with octopi


Sobotka is also famous for being the one to handle any octopuses thrown on the ice (see 




Legend of the Octopus



) during a game. Sobotka will grab the 
octopus with his bare hands and swing it around his head. He always receives a huge cheer.


In the April 2006 edition of 

Sports Illustrated
 Michael Farber wrote:


 The first face-offs [of the Stanley Cup tournament] were in Ottawa and Detroit at 7:12 p.m., although the unofficial commencement occurred two minutes earlier when an octopus landed on the ice with a splat during 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at the Wings' Joe Louis Arena. Nothing screams 'playoffs' like a cephalopod. (The Red Wings' tradition began in 1952 when two fishmongers realized that the number of tentacles on an octopus matched the number of wins then necessary to win the Stanley Cup.) Octopus-tossing is officially proscribed, but arena superintendent Al Sobotka tacitly encourages it by twirling octopuses over his head as he chugs off the ice after cleaning them up. In this year's playoff innovation, some Oilers fans threw hunks of prime Alberta beef onto the ice in response. 


Sobotka said in 1996 that an unofficial record of 54 octopuses were thrown during one game of the 1995 Stanley Cup final series between Detroit Red Wings and 









New Jersey Devils








. He also stated that Detroit fans throw an average of 25 octopuses per playoff game.5 For his tireless efforts, the Red Wings named their 

octopus mascot  Al 
 after Sobotka.


According to NHL rules, if any fan throws an object on the ice in celebration, the supported team could be issued a 
delay of game penalty. However, the NHL tends to look the other way when Sobotka does his stuff. 
Frank Brown, the league's vice president for media relations, said in response: 


 Every so often, an octopus slips out of someone's hands, and Al is right there to take care of the matter. And he cannot be blamed if, as it tries to break free from Al's grasp, the octopus lifts Al's arm and twirls itself in the air. 6


In the 2008 playoffs, the NHL issued a warning that while they were fine with Octopuses being thrown on the ice, the Red Wings would be fined $10,000 if Sobotka twirled the Octopus in the air, as bits of the Octopus were getting in the ice and on the opposing goaltender. 7 However, it was announced on May 7, 2008, that the NHL would allow Sobotka to twirl the octopi. http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080507/BLOG09/80507089

Referendums in Uruguay




A referendum on a constitutional amendment dealing with public ownership of water supply was held in 

Uruguay
 on 31 October, 2004 alongside a simultaneous 






general election





.


The issue


The proposed amendment to the 
constitution dealt with the issue of water supply and sanitation, including a statement that access to piped water and sanitation were fundamental human rights, and that


The public service of sewerage and the public service of water supplying for the human consumption, will be served exclusively and directly by state legal persons.  
http://www.psiru.org/reports/2004-11-W-crim.doc


The amendment was supported by (victorious) presidential candidate 
Tabare Vazquez and his 

Broad Front
 coalition. 
Friends of the Earth also supported the move, saying it  sets a key precedent for the protection of water worldwide, by enshrining these principles into the national constitution of one country by means of direct democracy.  
http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=26097




Results


The amendment was approved by almost 63% of voters.

Journals
Royal Society




The Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, (formerly known as Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society), is a journal published by the 






Royal Society of London





. It is published annually and publishes 
obituaries of 
Fellows of the Royal Society. Biographical Memoirs has been published since 1955; Obituary Notices was published from 1932-1954. Prior to this obituaries were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. 

The obituaries are often quite long and detailed. They often include portraits and 
bibliographies of work by their subjects. Usually they are written by a scientist of the next generation, often one of the subject's own former students.  They serve as excellent sources for research into biographies of scientists and for information about the 
history of science.  Tempered against this though is a slight tendency exaggerate achievements and to gloss over negative points.

Anne Palmer (batting) - 2nd Women's Test match in Sydney 1935.



Anne Palmer is an international cricketer who played 3 matches for the 

Australia national women's cricket team
 in the inaugural series against the 

England women's cricket team
 in the 1934/35 season.

She formed a formidable spin partnership with 

Peggy Antonio
, the  Girl Grimmett , taking ten wickets at 12 apiece and scoring 92 runs at 15.33.  She had practiced with Antonio at a local school in her youth and the pair took 22 of the 35 wickets to fall in the rubber.  A right-handed batsman she scored 92 runs in her three tests, with a best of 39, at 15.33.  Unfortunately she was unable to raise the money necessary to tour England with the team in 1937 and never played test cricket again.  


After winning a scholarship to continue her education she became 




Victoria



's first uniformed policewoman.  At the age of 89, was presented with a 'baggy green' Australia cap and badge in a ceremony in 2004 at the offices of 

Cricket Australia
 in 

Melbourne
.


Interviewed after the ceremony she recalled how some of her team mates slept on luggage racks as they traveled by train around the country: 





 

 I can still remember the feeling of walking into the 





MCG




. People used to watch our cricket as much as the men - you'd never believe it based on the publicity we got.

music hall tradition.

Aldershot
, 


Hampshire

World War II

Sergeant.  English worked as a painter and decorator in his native town. He polished up his comedy routines at this time and eventually appeared at the 

Windmill Theatre
 in London and did much other stage work.  His radio work began with the 

BBC
 series Variety Bandbox, using as always his own Aldershot accent.  His usual persona was a stereotypical wartime  
spiv , and he became known as  The Prince of the Wide Boys .  For a time he was resident comedian at the notorious 

Windmill Theatre

He began to appear on British television in mainly comedy roles in the 1970s, and was noticeable because of his manner and striking appearance.  He is best remembered for his character of the obnoxious and 'bolshy' maintenance man, Mr. Harman, in 

Are You Being Served?

Maritime incidents in 1917




The 












George A. Marsh











 was a three-masted 
schooner built in Michigan in 1882 as a lumber carrier. In 1914, the Marsh was sold to a Belleville man as a coal carrier.

The Marsh met her demise on August 8, 1917, when she sank during a storm, with a loss of twelve of the fourteen crew (including seven children between the ages of one and thirteen).


The wreck of the Marsh currently rests in 

Lake Ontario
, in roughly 80 feet of water.

Historic Films Archive is a 
video archive operating from 





New York




. It owns the rights to an extensive collection of 
television and 
film footage dating back to 
1895.


 History 



The company originated as a 

Manhattan
 based research archive named Associated Researchers and Image Quest; it was founded by Joe Lauro and Richard Plagge in 
1991. Lauro had previously worked for Archive Films as a researcher and decided to form his own company. They soon realized that licensing footage paid more than just researching where to find it. In 
1993, the company moved to 
East Hampton, close to Plagge's home.


In 
1994 Plagge died, and Lauro formed a partnership with 

California
 producer Andrew Solt, the owner of the rights to the  
Ed Sullivan Show.  They converted ARIQ into the Historic Film Archive in 
1997.

A Mokopa anti-tank guided missile




The 









Mokopa








 is a 

South Africa
n air-to-ground 
missile, designed primarily for use as an 
anti-tank weapon. It is currently in its final stages of development, and is being integrated onto the 

South African Air Force
's 
Rooivalk attack 
helicopters. The missile is produced by 

Denel Aerospace Systems
, formerly Kentron. The current version utilises Semi-Active Laser (SAL) guidance, requiring the target to be illuminated by a 
laser designator either on the launch platform or elsewhere; though there are alternative guidance packages available including a millimetre-wave 
radar (MMW) seeker and a two-colour imaging 
infrared (IIR) seeker.

 Funkadelic songs




 Let's Take It to the Stage  is a song by 


Funkadelic

, the 
title track to their 
1975 
album 

Let's Take It to the Stage
. It
was written by 
George Clinton, 


Bootsy Collins

 and 

Garry Shider
, with lead vocals by Clinton. The lyrics consist of mockery of other popular bands,  
nursery rhymes, and 



stream-of-consciousness


-style 
rapping.


Lyrics





The title of the song, sung as  let's take it to the stage, sucker , is a challenge to other popular bands, inviting them to participate in a  




battle of the bands



 . (See 



Cutting contest


 and 
Freestyle battle.) Several bands are  
called out  in the song:










James Brown






, known as  The Godfather of Soul     Talking 'bout you the Godfather. Godmother! Grandfather!  Also referred to as  James Clown. 






Earth, Wind   Fire


    Earth, Hot Air   No Fire 




Kool   the Gang
     Fool   the Gang 




Rufus
 and their hit  Tell Me Something Good     Hey Sloofus! Tell Me Something Good! 








Sly Stone




 and 


Sly   the Family Stone

    Slick Brick  and  Slick and the Family Brick 


Some of the songs lyrics seem similar to an old folk rhyme that was first published in Thomas T. Talley's Negro Folk Rhymes (Wise or Otherwise) (1922):





Funkadelic:Sittin in the woods upon a logFinger on the triggerMy eyes on a hogAnd I sat back.






Negro Folk Rhymes:Nigger in de woods, a-settin' on a logWid his finger on de trigger, an' his eyes upon de hogDe gun say  bam!  and de hog say  bip! An' de nigger grab dat wild hog wid all his grip.








 Tricky Dick wasn't worried about no incriminating Watergate information being on those tapes. That sucker didn't want y'all to dig on him trying to cop an ounce of that P-blow! 




President
 



Richard Nixon


 was often referred to mockingly as  Tricky Dick .


 








Watergate







  was a series of political scandals that involved political 
espionage and 
sabotage, illegal break-ins, 
wiretapping, and 
obstruction of justice. The Watergate scandal led to Nixon's resignation in 1974. During the Watergate investigation, it was revealed that Nixon had a tape recording system in his 

White House
 offices and that he had 








recorded many conversations







.


 Incriminating ... information ... on those tapes  refers to the mysterious 








18  minute gap







 that had been erased from the tapes Nixon provided to Watergate investigators. Since the discovery of the gap in 1973, there has been a great deal of speculation regarding the conversation that had been erased, and why it was considered so embarrassing that somebody chose to erase it.


 P-blow  could refer to 





P-Funk




 (that is, Nixon was listening to P-Funk) or 
cocaine, commonly referred to as  blow .

Malay clothing




Baju is the term for clothing in the 
Malay language. Since 

Malaysia
 comprises three major cultures: Malay, Chinese and Indian, each culture has its own traditional and religious articles of clothing all of which are gender specific and may be adapted to local influences and conditions.


Women



Malay


Malay women wear a 
baju kurung 
baju melayu and 
baju kebaya




Chinese


The Chinese women wear the cheongsam, a one-piece dress with a high neck, diagonally closed with small clips or toggles (fabric clasps). It can be fitted or loose, with side slits at the hem. The cheongsam is especially popular around the time of the Chinese New Year and other formal gatherings (the fourth and fifth women from the right in the picture above). Older well-respected women wear a samfoo, which looks like pajamas with a separate loose fitting top fastened by toggles and ankle length, or above the ankle, pants.




Indian


Indian women wear very colorful saris in a rich variety of bright and subtle dyes during ritual prayer in the temple and for everyday living (first and second women from the left in the picture above, and picture at the right). The fabric imported from India, made of the best quality silk is used in making saris. There are two layers to a sari: a long bright colored  dress  decorated with colorful beads sewn on it to make it look more attractive, and a wrap, a piece of straight fabric draped around one shoulder which ties across the body around the waist area. Women with a high standing will have their clothing made from gold and silver thread with elaborate beading.





Men



Malay and Indian


For the Malay culture, the men wear baju melayu with a songkok or cap, on their head. Traditional clothing for men in Malaysia consists of a silk or cotton skirt and shirt with a scarf like piece of cloth tied around his waist. This scarf is sewn together at the ends and is traditionally called a sarong or a kain. Most of the clothing is made up of bright and bold colors. The man also wears a religious hat. 


The Indian men wear Sherwani, Lungi, Dhoti and Kurta-Pajama.The Sherwani: a coat like garment fitted close to the body, of knee-length or longer and opening in front with button-fastenings. Below the men wear a garment for the lower part of the body, baggy and wide at the top tied with a string at the waist , and  tight around the legs and ankles. elhi. 


The Lungi: The traditional lungi originated in the south and today it is worn by men and women alike. It is simply a short length of material worn around the thighs rather like a sarong.


The Dhoti: The most ancient recorded Indian drape is a dhoti. They require a piece of cloth which seems longer and larger than what was worn in the past, but their pleating is often simpler, and they are not adorned with belts anymore.
All dhotis begin with the same basic closing. It is the only drape that doesn't start from one pallav but from the centre of the upper border. The middle of the cloth is tied around the hips. Each end of the cloth is then draped around the leg on its side.


The Kurta-Pyjama: The Kurta or the top is a knee length colarless shirt which is adorned inmostly white or pastel colors. But today you will find Kurtas made out of the most wonderful and colorful of fabrics. Pyjama-are like loose trousers with a string tie at the waist. Traditionally white in color.




The Chinese men wear silk blouses and silk jackets, samfu that hugs the body tightly and is made from one piece of fabric.




Chinese


The classical everyday clothing for men in Malaysia is a short sleeved shirt worn outside the trousers, light-weight trousers and informally, sandals for comfort.





Glossary


Baju Kurung Kedah   worn only by Malay women as a daily dress for married women. it is a shorter dress with three-quarter sleeves, so the wearer can move around easily. 


Baju Batik   worn by men and women on a formal occasion. Usually colorful cotton printed in the 
batik or wax resist method of dyeing.


Baju Melayu   worn by Malay men, it does not have any buttons but has a special kind of button called a butang. The fabric used to make a baju melayu is made from either nylon, satin, or silk. Along with this is a songkok or kopiah, worn on the head. Songkok are generally a dark natural color, and the kopiah is a white color and represents purity.


Baju Kurung   a baju kurung is worn by women for occasions such as school (as a uniform) or to a wedding. It too is brightly colored and can come in a variety of different printed designs. It is a knee length dress with a full length sleeves.


Baju Kebarung   is a combination of the baju kebaya and the baju kurung. It is loose and almost reaches the ankles; it is not one of the traditional clothes of the Malay, but an adaptation.

DeMarco Murray (born 
February 12, 
1988 in 

Las Vegas, Nevada
) is an 
American football 
running back for the 
Oklahoma Sooners.  DeMarco Murray logged a 4.42 (team best) 40 time1 and a 36.5-inch vertical jump2 during the 2007 winter testing.  DeMarco Murray has yet to declare a major at the University of Oklahoma.  Murray also graces the number 7 on his football jersey.


Early years


Murray attended 
Hyde Park Middle School in 

Las Vegas
.




High school career 


DeMarco Murray was coached by David White at 

Bishop Gorman High School
 in 

Las Vegas, Nevada
, where he was an all-conference pick three consecutive years. At Gorman, he was a teammate of fellow OU Sooner 

Ryan Reynolds
 and current 
Arizona State Offensive Lineman Po'u Palelei. As a senior in 2005, he rushed for 1,947 yards and 27 touchdowns and also caught 22 passes for 624 yards and 7 touchdowns, earning him all-state honors and the 2005 Sunset Region Offensive Player of the Year award. Murray was invited to play in the 
U.S. Army All-American Bowl.


Considered one of the top running backs of his class alongside 

Chris Wells
, 


C. J. Spiller

 and 
Michael Goodson, Murray drew offers from 

Miami (Fl.)
, 

Penn State
 and 


Texas A M

 among others. He chose Oklahoma over  


Southern California

 at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.3


Murray also led Bishop Gorman basketball team to a 2005 state championship.
ee




 College career 





Murray hoists a trophy moments after leading the Oklahoma Sooners to a 28-21 victory of the Texas Longhorns during the 2007 Red River Rivalry game. Murray carried the ball 17 times for 128 yards and a touchdown.



DeMarco Murray 
redshirted the 

2006 NCAA football season
.
In his first game for the Oklahoma Sooners on 
September 1, 
2007 vs. 

University of North Texas
, Murray rushed for 201 yards and five touchdowns, becoming the first player to score four touchdowns in a half in his Sooner debut.4 On 
September 15, 
2007 against Utah State, Murray entered the Oklahoma football record book when he had a TD run of 97 yards, which is the 2nd longest in Oklahoma football history.


Murray tied 

Adrian L. Peterson
 s freshman touchdown record in 2007 with 15 and probably would have broken it had it not been for a season ending knee injury at Texas Tech.

Dead by Sunrise (previously known as Snow White Tan) is the 
side project of 


Linkin Park

's 
lead vocalist, 



Chester Bennington


. The name Snow White Tan was speculated to be a reference to the 


David Bowie

 track  

Ziggy Stardust
 , which includes the lyrics  Came on so loaded, man/Well hung and snow-white tan , but the band's renaming to Dead by Sunrise by Chester has not been publicly explained. Chester has said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly,  We were called Snow White Tan for a while, and then I changed the name to Dead By Sunrise, but I really just like Chester Bennington. 



Background information


The band, which also features 

Amir Derakh
 and 

Ryan Shuck
 of the band 
Orgy, and Anthony  Fu  Valcic, is Bennington's solo endeavor. The Dead by Sunrise album has been recorded in full and was originally slated for a 
2006 release, and then an early 
2007 release, but due to his commitments to 


Linkin Park

, Chester has put the release on hold until early 2009. Recent 
news posted by The Pulse of Radio say that Chester Bennington's solo album is still in production and will be finalized sometime during Spring of 
2008. Bennington stated in an interview with 

Rolling Stone
 that he hopes to put the Dead By Sunrise album in 2009. He also said in an interview with Orange County Register that he will work on the album simultaneously with a fourth Linkin Park record. 


Chester performs 
guitar and 
keyboard on the album, as well as 
singing. All extra instrumental, programming and production was undertaken by Ryan, Amir, and Fu. The album does not yet have a title, but names have been thrown around previously. It is also said to be a far-cry from the sounds of Linkin Park and draws influence from '90s rock as well as '80s pop such as 


The Cure

, 


Depeche Mode

, and 

Bauhaus
. When asked in an interview about the difference between Dead By Sunrise and Linkin Park, Bennington responded,  It s hard to describe. Like, describe the difference between Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, you know what I mean? It s almost impossible. There are obvious things about it that when you listen to it, you ll know it s not a Linkin Park record. You re not gonna get confused. You ll have to hear it.

Brazilians of German descent
Brazilian swimmers







Maria Lenk with then-Brazilian Minister of Sports 
Agnelo Queiroz



Maria Emma Hulga Lenk (
January 15, 
1915   
April 16, 
2007) was a 

Brazilian
 
swimmer and to date is considered one of the best Brazilian female swimmers.

At the age of 17, she was the first 


Brazilian

 and 



South-American


 woman to participate in the 
Summer Olympic Games, at the 









1932 Summer Olympics








, in 
Los Angeles.1



Biography


Born in 
Sao Paulo, Maria Lenk was the first Brazilian in history to set a world record in swimming. On 
November 8, 
1939, in 

Rio de Janeiro
 with a time of 2:56.0, she beat 
Jopie Waalberg's previous record of 2:56.9, for the 
200m breaststroke event. This record lasted almost 5 years, until 








Nel van Vliet







, from the 



Netherlands


 broke it on 
August 17, 
1946, with a time of 2:52.6.


In the same year, she also broke the world record for the discontinued category of 400m breaststroke, with a time of 6:15.8.


She also participated in the 
1936 Summer Olympics, in 















Berlin














, where she reached the semifinals of the 


200m breaststroke event

. In this occasion, she also became the first woman in the world to swim the 
Butterfly stroke in an official competition.  At the time, the Butterfly stroke was used as a form of swimming the  
Breaststroke, and not yet recognized as a separate swimming stroke.  Lenk's account of the event was that at the time she subscribed to a 

German
 specialized magazine that ran a story on 
David Armbruster's and 






Jack Sieg





's work in developing  a new way of swimming the Breaststroke .  She became interested and started practicing the stroke by herself in her training sections.  In 1936, she and Jack Sieg were the only two people that were prepared to use the technique in the Breaststroke events at the Summer Olympics.


Lenk's goal of winning an Olympic medal was cut short when 







World War II






 caused the cancellation of the Games of 1940 and 1944, which would have corresponded to her peak in competitive swimming.


She retired in 1942, but never stopped swimming, focusing on Masters events.


On 
April 16, 
2007, she was training in the 


Clube de Regatas do Flamengo

's swimming pool when her blood pressure dropped and she suffered a sudden 
respiratory arrest. She was taken to Copa D'Or Hospital, in 







Copacabana






, but medical personnel couldn't revive her and she died of 
cardiac arrest, aged 92. 2


Before her death, Maria Lenk still swam 1  kilometres every day, even in her 90s.




Master World Records


At the time of her death, Maria Lenk still held five Master World Records:

Awards





In 1988, she was inducted the 
FINA 






Swimming Hall of Fame





 and, in the same year, was awarded the  Top Ten  award given to the best masters swimmers worldwide.







In 2004, she received the 
Adhemar Ferreira da Silva Trophy for lifetime achievement from the 

Brazilian Olympic Committee
 at the 
Premio Brasil Olimpico, an annual award given to the best athletes in each Olympic sport.







On 
February 12, 
2007, the 
mayor of 

Rio de Janeiro
, Cesar Maia, officially gave her name to the new Aquatic Park venue that held swimming, diving and synchronized swimming events at the 





2007 Pan American Games




, in Rio de Janeiro.







On 
April 17, 
2007, one day after her death, the president of the Confederacao Brasileira de Desportos Aquaticos (Brazilian Water Sports Confederation), 
Coaracy Nunes, announced that the name of the Trofeu Brasil de Natacao (Brazilian Swimming Trophy) had been changed to the Maria Lenk Trophy in Lenk's honour.3

The All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship of 1973 was the 87th edition of 

Ireland
 s premier 
hurling knockout competition.  The championship ran from May to September of 
that year, culminating with the All-Ireland final, held at 




Croke Park



, 

Dublin
 on 
2 September.  The match was contested by 

Limerick
 and 

Kilkenny
, with Limerick taking the title by 1-21 to 1-14.  It was Limerick s first championship title since 
1940.


Format



The All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was run on a provincial basis as usual.  All games were played on a knockout basis whereby once a team lost they were eliminated from the championship.  The format for the All-Ireland series of games ran as follows: 



 The winners of the 
Leinster Championship advanced directly to the All-Ireland final.  


 The winners of the 

Munster Championship
 advanced directly to a lone All-Ireland semi-final.  


 

Galway
, a team who faced no competition in the 
Connacht Championship, entered the championship at the All-Ireland quarter-final stage where they played 





London




.  The winners of this game advanced to the All-Ireland semi-final where they played the Munster champions.


 There were no representatives from the 





Ulster Championship




 in the All-Ireland series.  






All-Ireland final



Overview



Sunday 
2 September was the date of the 1973 All-Ireland senior hurling final between Kilkenny and Limerick.  It was their first meeting in the championship since the 
1940 championship decider when Limerick were the winners.  Kilkenny were playing in their third All-Ireland final in-a-row, having lost to 

Tipperary
 in 
1971 and having defeated 

Cork
 in 
1973. 




Match report



At 3:15pm the referee threw in the sliothar and the game got underway in earnest.  Limerick would undoubtedly have started the game as rank outsiders against a Kilkenny team ranked as one of the greatest of all-time; however,  the Cats  suffered an amazing streak of bad luck.  Between the Leinster and All-Ireland finals Kilkenny lost many of their key players for one reason or another.  
Eamonn Morrissey emigrated to 

Australia
, 

Jim Treacy
 was ruled out due to injury, 

Kieran Purcell
 couldn t play because of appendicitis and star forward 

Eddie Keher
 couldn t play because of a broken collar bone.  Limerick saw their chance and pulled a masterstroke when the moved 
Eamonn Cregan from the forwards back to centre-back where he marked Kilkenny s main score-getter 

Pat Delaney
.  On a wet day at Croke Park Limerick had the upper hand and led by 0-12 to 1-7 at half-time.  Cregan had done a good job marking Delaney; however, he still sneaked in for the only goal of the opening forty minutes.  Kilkenny drew level six minutes after the restart with points from 

Claus Dunne
 and 

Liam  Chunky  O Brien
, however, the game then turned on two important incidents.  Limerick goalkeeper 
Seamus Horgan made a spectacular save from a 

Mick Crotty
 shot before clearing his lines.  Up at the other end of the field a poor puck-out by Kilkenny  keeper 

Noel Skehan
 gave 

Mossie Dowling
 the chance to scramble in a goal.  After this the momentum was with Limerick as 

Richie Bennis
 spear-headed a rampant attack as Limerick were declared the champions with a 1-21 to 1-14 score line.

Energy
Statistical data sets




Energy statistics refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as 
coal, 
crude oil, 
natural gas, 
electricity, or renewable energy sources (
biomass, 
geothermal, 
wind or 
solar energy), when they are used for the energy they contain. 
Energy is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do 
work or produce 
heat. Some energy commodities, called 
fuels, release their energy content as heat when they 
burn. This heat could be used to run an 
internal or 
external combustion engine.

The need to have 
statistics on energy commodities became obvious during the 





1973 oil crisis




 that brought tenfold increase in 
petroleum prices. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between 
developed and 
developing countries. As the gap narrows (see picture), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.


Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004


 


The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:



 
Energy industry


 Other industries ( self-producers )


 Consumers


The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., 
metric tons), and, when 
energy balances are calculated, in energy units (e.g., 
terajoules or 
tons of oil equivalent). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of 
economic statistics is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the 
first and 
second laws of thermodynamics.

For other uses, see 
Kiss of the Spider Woman.

The 1983 stage play Kiss of the Spider Woman is an adaptation of 





Manuel Puig




's 





same title novel




 by the author himself.


Novelist, screenwriter and playwright Manuel Puig wrote two plays while living in exile. The first was a dramatised version of his 1976 novel El beso de la mujer arana (





Kiss of the Spider Woman




), written in 1983 and first staged in London in 1985 at the 

Bush Theatre
, in an English language version by translator 
Allan Baker, starring 

Mark Rylance
 and 

Simon Callow
.  


Baker's version was revived in April 2007 at the 

Donmar Warehouse
 with 

Rupert Evans
 as Valentin and 









Will Keen








 as Molina. 
http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article1707326.ece


Set in a cell at the 





Villa Devoto




 prison in 

Buenos Aires
 in 1976, it shows the developing relationship of a political activist Valentin Arregui Paz and his cellmate Luis Alberto Molina, a homosexual who has apparently been 'planted' to sniff out the secrets of Valentin's 
Marxist group. 


The novel was also adapted by 

Leonard Schrader
 for a 1985 film version directed by 
Hector Babenco, and in 1993 as a Broadway stage musical by 
















John Kander















 and 















Fred Ebb














.


Puig's second play was El misterio del ramode de rosas (
Mystery of the Rose Bouquet) also translated by Baker and first produced in 1987.

World War II crimes in Poland







Poles led to the trains under German army escort, as part of the 
Nazi German ethnic cleansing of western Poland annexed to the 
Reich, following the 

invasion of 1939
.



The 
partitions of Poland had ended the existence of a sovereign Polish state in the 18th century. With the rise of 
nationalism in the late 19th century, 
Poles faced increasing discrimination. The first 
deportation of 30,000 Poles from the 

German Empire
 took place in 1885. While ideas of expelling Poles can be found in German political discourse of the 19th century, these ideas matured into full-scale plans during the 
First World War, calling for the removal of Polish population from territories that were to be annexed by Germany from the Russian Empire.1  The 
Nazis adopted these plans when creating their 
Lebensraum concept1 Large scale expulsions of Poles occurred during 







World War II






, when 

Nazi Germany
 started the 
Generalplan Ost campaign to 
ethnically cleanse the 



annexed Polish areas


. Although the Nazis were not able to fully implement Generalplan Ost due to the war's turn, up to 2 million Poles were affected by wartime expulsions with additional millions displaced or killed.


Origins of the idea



Since the creation of the 

German Empire
 in 1871, Poles constituted one of its largest minorities as a result of earlier expansions of 

Prussia
, the very state that initiated the 
foundation of the German Empire.1 Prussia had acquired territories with a Polish population by taking part in the 
Partitions of Poland and the 







Silesian Wars






 with 

Austria
 in the 18th century.


The rise of 





German nationalism




 was followed by the idea of 
pan-Germanism, demanding the unification of all Germans in one state, including the German diaspora. Some pan-Germanists believed that Germans were ethnically superior to other peoples   including 
Slavs, whom they viewed as inferior to the German  race  and culture. The 
Nazi concept of 
Lebensraum in turn demanded  living space  for German people, claiming overpopulation of Germany and alleged negative traits of heavy urbanisation in contrast to agricultural settlement. The desired territories were to be taken in the East. Both pan-Germanism and Lebensraum theory viewed Poles as an obstacle to German hegemony and prosperity as well as future expansion of the German state.1




German Empire



German authorities, fearing that the possible rebirth of Poland would threaten German control over the territories annexed in her Partitions, sought to limit the number of Poles by forced 
Germanisation and by new wave of 
settlement by German colonists1. Beginning with the 
Kulturkampf, laws were enacted to restrict Polish culture, religion, language and property. Bismarck initiated the 
Prussian deportations of 1885-1890, which affected some 30,000 Poles and 
Jews living in Germany whithout holding German citizenship. This is described by E.J. Feuchtwanger as the precursor to modern 
ethnic cleansing2. In 1887 
Bernhard von Bulow, the future 
Chancellor of the German Empire, advocated expelling Poles by force from territories which were Polish-inhabited and slated to become part of Germany.3


Already in 1908 Germany legalised eviction of Poles from their properties under pressure from pan-German nationalist groups who hoped this law would be used to reduce the number of Poles in the East by force.1



First World War



During the First World War Germany planned to annex about 30,000 km  from 

Congress Poland
 for German colonisation.1 Most of the Polish population of those territories (about 2,000,000 people) was to be expelled into a greatly reduced Polish puppet state.1 The remaining population was to be used as agricultural labour for German colonists.1





Nazi Germany






With the occupation of Poland following the German invasion of the country, Nazi policies were enacted upon its Polish population on an unprecedented scale. According to Nazi ideology Poles, as 
Untermensch, were seen as fit only for 
slavery and for further elimination in order to make room for the Germans. 


Adolf Hitler

 had plans for extensive colonisation of territories in the east of the 
Third Reich. Poland, itself, would   according to well documented German plans   have been cleared of Polish people altogether, as 20 million or so would have been expelled eventually.  Up to 3 or 4 million Polish citizens (all peasants) believed be descendants of German colonists and migrants and therefore considered  racially valuable  would be Germanised and dispersed among the German population.4  Nazi leadership hoped that through expulsions to 
Siberia, 
famine, mass 
executions, and slave labour of any survivors Polish nation would be eventually completely destroyed.5 



Second World War











World War II






 expulsions took place within two specific territories: one area annexed to Reich in 1939 and 1941, and another, the 
General Gouvernment, precursor to further expansion of German administrative settlement area. Eventually, as 


Adolf Hitler

 explained in March 1941, the General Gouvernment would be cleared of Poles, the region would be turned into a  purely German area  within 15 20 years and in place of 15 million Poles, 4 5 million Germans would live there, and the area would become  as German as the 


Rhineland

.6 



Expulsions from Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany

Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany





Generalplan Ost (GPO) was a Nazi plan to ethnically cleanse the territories occupied by Germany in Eastern Europe during World War II.
According to research of professor  uczak, Germans expelled the following numbers of Poles from territories annexed to the Reich in the period of 1939-1944:



 
Warthegau region 630,000


 
Silesia 80,000


 


Pomerelia

 124,000


 
Bia ystok 25,000


 
Ciechanow 28,000




Combined with  wild expulsions , in four years 923,000 Poles were ethnically cleansed from territories Germany annexed into the Reich7.




Expulsions from General Government


On the territories of the German protoctorate called General Government there were two main areas of expulsions committed by the German state. The protectorate itself was seen as temporary measure, and served as a 
concentration camp for Poles to perform hard labour furthering German industry and war effort. Eventually it was to be cleared of Poles also.




Zamo  


116,000 Poles were expelled from the 
Zamo   region as part of Nazi plans for establishment of German colonies in the conquered territories. Zamo   itself was to be renamed Himmlerstadt, later changed to Pflugstadt (Plow City), that was to symbolise the German  Plow  that was to  plough  the East. Additionally almost 30,000 children were kidnapped by German authorities from their parents for potential Germanisation7. This led to massive resistance (see 
Zamo   Uprising).




Warsaw



In October 1940, 115 thousand Poles were expelled from their homes in central Warsaw to make room for the Jewish Ghetto, constructed there by German authorities. 


After the failure of the 








Warsaw Uprising







, 500,000 people were expelled from the city alone as punishment by German authorities7.






Demographic estimates


It is estimated that between 1.6 and 2 million people 8 were expelled from their homes during the German occupation of Poland. Only the German organized expulsions affected directly 1,710,000 Poles.7 Additionally, 2.5 to 3 million Poles were taken from Poland as slave labourers to Germany to support the Nazi war effort.5 These numbers do not include people arrested by the Germans and sent to Nazi concentration camps.8


In many instances, Poles were given between 15 minutes and 1 hour to collect their personal belongings (usually no more than 15 kilograms per person) before they were thrown out of their homes and transported east (see: 
deportations) On top of that about 5 million Poles were sent to 
German concentration camps. A total of about 6 million Polish citizens were killed during the war. All these actions resulted in significant changes in Polish demographics at the end of the war.

Red Doors is a 
2006 








American







 movie directed by 

















Georgia Lee
















. The 
independent film features a Chinese American family.


Plot


Red Doors tells the story of the Wongs, a bizarrely dysfunctional Chinese-American family living in the New York suburbs. Ed Wong (Tzi Ma) has just retired and plots to escape his mundane life. However, the tumultuous, madcap lives of his three rebellious daughters change his plans. 


Samantha (Jacqueline Kim), the eldest daughter, is a tough New York businesswoman engaged to a prominent young man (Jayce Bartok). Festering beneath her controlled surface, however, is a deep-rooted resentment for being pushed onto the straight and narrow path. As she nears her thirtieth birthday, Samantha begins to reevaluate her career and love life. When she runs into an old high school flame (Rossif Sutherland) during a visit to her hometown, Samantha is thrust into a soul-searching journey that compels her to reexamine how she has lived her life until now. 


Julie (Elaine Kao), the shy middle sister, is a fourth-year medical student whose only social outlet is her weekly ballroom dance class. Julie has always been the quiet center of the Wong family storm. However, Julie s world is turned upside down when she meets Mia Scarlett (Mia Riverton), a movie star researching her next role at the hospital, who sets Julie s heart aflame. While Julie grapples with the difficulties of dating a celebrity, she also tries to keep her own family from falling apart. 


Katie (Kathy Shao-Lin Lee), the youngest sister, is a disaffected high school senior who engages in an elaborate prank war with Simon (Sebastian Stan), her longtime neighbor and nemesis. While the pranks start out innocuously, the incidents rapidly escalate to dangerous proportions until the two finally discover their own peculiar brand of emotional connection. 


Before Ed disappears, he decides to re-visit his history through old VHS footage of the Wong family (the director s own home video footage). The stark contrast between the happier past and the colder reality of the present compel Ed to leave home. Yet, while the Wongs may no longer be able to verbally express their feelings, Ed and the daughters learn to communicate again through the stories and images from the past.

Peter Mochrie

March 23, 1958 (1958-03-23) (age 51)





Peter Mochrie (born 

Sydney
, 

Australia
, 
March 23 
1958) has enjoyed great success as one of Australia's leading actors. In a career that spans over twenty-five years, he has appeared in many of Australias top rating television programs. Mochrie is currently starring in the New Zealand soap 

Shortland Street
 as Dr. Callum Mckay.



Early Years and Growing career


Peter Mochrie was born in 1958 and brought up in the Northern suburbs of Sydney, attending 





Knox Grammar School




. Mochrie's love of acting started at the age of 13 while appearing in a school play. In 1979, he got his first big break appearing in 

The Restless Years
 as Ric Moran. Mochrie stayed in this role for 2 years and soon caught the attention of other TV producers, later appearing on 
Sons and Daughters, 
Neighbours and 
Holiday Island. He also appeared in two movies, 
Winter of Our Dreams and 
Just In Time.




Professional Training


In 1987, Mochrie was accepted into the prestigious 

NIDA
. He studied there for 3 years and appeared in numerous productions before graduating in 1989.




Career Broadens


After completing his professional training, Mochrie continued to achieve the same success on television as he had held previously, in shows such as 
Home and Away, 

Blue Heelers
 and 
G.P.


In 1995 he auditioned for the role of John  Knocker  Harrison for 

Water Rats
. While he was only in the series for one season, he left such an impression on the producer, 
Hal McElroy, that he was asked to audition for a new police show McElroy was working on, 

Murder Call
. Mochrie won the role of Steve Hayden, starring alongside 
Lucy Bell who played Tessa Vance. He starred in this popular Australian television drama for 2 years. 


After the show finished, Peter took a well deserved break, concentrating on his landscaping business, as well as travelling and one of his favourite past times, surfing. In 2000, Mochrie again returned to TV as Rick Fontaine in 

Cybergirl
. The series, which was filmed in 

Brisbane
, was shown on commercial as well as cable television, and was an award winning children's show.


Recently Mochrie returned to the stage, in 
Spinning into Butter by 









Rebecca Gilman








, for the 




Ensemble Theatre



, Sydney. He thoroughly enjoyed returning to the stage and said that he had particularly enjoyed working in front of a live audience once again, with such a talented cast and director and that he looks forward to doing this type of work again in the future.


Since the play completed its successful season, Peter has been busy doing voice-overs for a number of commercials and a broad range of other work.




Acting Teacher



In 2000 Mochrie started teaching  Introduction Into Screen Acting  for NIDA's Open Program. He proved to be so popular with the students, that he was asked back the following year and has been teaching the subject now for 6 years.

The Albert Einstein International School of San Pedro Sula (AEIS) is a college preparatory international school located in 

San Pedro Sula
, the second largest and industrial city of 

Honduras
. It is a private, non-profit, coeducational day school, which offers an American education system to Honduran and foreign students in San Pedro Sula. The school offers a comprehensive college preparatory program covering all sections, from kindergarten through 12th grade. The school, previously named Albert Einstein School of San Pedro Sula or Escuela Bilingue Albert Einstein in Spanish was founded in 1990.

In 2005, the school administration decided to make a total change to the school itself. The change consisted in making the institution an international school for San Pedro Sula. The change was consisted in several aspects; including a change in school governance, a change in the curriculum to a program modeled on sound United States educational practices, more bilateral relations with U.S. entities, the creation of a U.S. organization that can govern the school offering a U.S.- type education with international standards, creation of U.S. educational programs and services in the school, creation of the American High School program, addition of North American staff to the school, etc.


In April 2006, the school was acquired into partnership by the Albert Einstein International Educational Corporation, a U.S. corporation with headquarter office in the United States governed by Honduran and American citizens. This organization makes general assemblies in the United States every two months in order to check school's improvement. Although this school is located in Honduras, AEIS is a tax-exempt school in the United States. Also the school is registered and recognized by the 

NATO
.


This preparatory school started as a bilingual school with 7 students. Now, it is an international school with 220 students.



In the American High School program, students need to earn 24 carnegie credits in order to get the High School diploma. Additionally, students have a variety of programs in order to be ready to attend U.S. colleges/universities. Those programs are the Honors Program, a program composed by rigorous courses in which the student gains strength and preparation for U.S. college/university courses. Another program is the 
Advanced Placement program  AP , a program with rigorous courses in which the student gets college/university credits while the student attends High School. Those credits are valid in all U.S. colleges/universities and important universities around the world. The AP program is offered in U.S. High Schools and American International overseas schools. The AP courses at A.E.I.S. are instructed by certified professors that have taught in prestigious U.S. universities such as 
Stanford U., 
Princeton U., 
Michigan State U, and 
Harvard University.



 Admissions 



In Albert Einstein International School of San Pedro Sula (AEIS), registration is different comparing to other schools in San Pedro Sula. Registration starts in May. The matriculation period is opened to all students. Prospective parents need to pay a Registration fee which is US$100.00. Tuition costs vary the grade in which the student is registered. Tuition and fees start from US$1200.00.




 Student Body and Faculty 


The student body is around 220 students; composed by 94% Hondurans, 5% Americans, 1% other nationalities. The faculty is composed by 35% U.S. and Canadian, 5% Guatemalan, and 60% Honduran teachers.




 Activities 


The school offers a variety of co-curricular and extracurricular activities. Most activities are the Yearbook club, 
Model United Nations in which students attend a conference in the United States hosted by the 
University of Chicago, Chess, Folkloric groups, 



U.S. Beta Club


, etc.




 Athletics 


The school's sport strength is Volleyball. Also the school offers Soccer. A.E.I.S. participates in several regional tournaments. A.E.I.S. varsity High School athletes can easily apply to Division I or II of U.S. universities because all High School courses are accredited by the 
NCAA.




 Facilities 


The school is located in the Los Andes neighborhood, one of the most fashionable and safe suburbs of San Pedro Sula. The one- acre campus is divided in 5 areas. The school has 14 classrooms, including a Computer Lab in the Elementary, Middle and High School buildings. Also, there is a library located at the Junior High School area. The administrative offices and the apartment residency for foreign teachers are located in separate areas.


In 2006, the school acquired a new land, called  Area E  of the campus. At Area E, the school plans to make a major project in order to meet international standards. The project consists on making a new gymnasium, a media center, and a Science Lab. The first part of the project will be done by January 2008, and the second part by May 2008. The gymnasium will have all the basic amenities associated with comparable facilities in the United States. The media center will replace the current Library and the Science Laboratory will have all the basic amenities associated with comparable facilities at international schools. The project will be administered by the U.S. Middle States Council and the Albert Einstein International Educational Corporation.


In addition, the campus has 2 outdoor hard surface courts for basketball, volleyball and soccer.

Saurischians




 Comanchesaurus  is an 
informal name for 
fossilized remains from the 
Late Triassic of 





New Mexico




 that were initially interpreted as belonging to a 
theropod 
dinosaur.  The remains, 
NMMNH P-4569, consist of a partial skeleton including 
vertebral 
centra and hindlimb bones, and came from the 
Norian-age 
Upper Triassic 
Bull Canyon Formation of 

Guadalupe  County
.  Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name  Comanchesaurus kuesi  for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007). In the redescription, the authors found the material to belong to a  possible indeterminate 
saurischian .1

Illustration by Thackeray to Chapter 1 of Vanity Fair: Becky Sharp, wearing a  killing expression,  is  flirting with Mr Joseph Sedley.



Becky Sharp is the 
anti-heroine of 


William Makepeace Thackeray

's  satirical novel 
Vanity Fair (1847 48). A cynical social climber who uses her charms to  fascinate and seduce upper-class men, Sharp is contrasted with the clinging, dependent heroine Amelia Sedley.  Sharp functions as a 
picaroon by being a social outsider who is able to expose the manners of the upper gentry to ridicule. Her name ( sharp  having connotations of a  sharper  or confidence man) and function suggest that Thackeray intended her to be unsympathetic, and yet she became one of his most popular creations.

The decade of the 1870s in film involved some significant events.


__TOC__




Events






1870s - 

French
 inventor 
Charles-Emile Reynaud improved on the 
Zoetrope idea by placing mirrors at the center of the drum. He called his invention the 
Praxinoscope. Reynaud  developed other versions of the Praxinoscope, too, including a Praxinoscope Theatre (where the device was enclosed in a viewing box) and also the Projecting Praxinoscope. Eventually he created the  Theatre Optique , a large machine based on the Praxinoscope, but was able to project longer animated strips. In the USA, the McLoughlin Bros from New York released in 1879 a simplified (and unauthorized) copy of Reynaud's invention under the name  Whirligig of Life .








1878 - Railroad tycoon 

Leland Stanford
 hired British photographer 


Eadweard Muybridge

 to settle a bet on whether a galloping horse ever had all four of its feet off the ground. Muybridge successfully photographed a horse in fast motion using a series of 12 cameras controlled by trip wires. Muybridge's photos showed the horse with all four feet off the ground. Muybridge went on a lecture tour showing his photographs on a moving-image device he called the 
zoopraxiscope. Muybridge s experiments inspired 

French
 scientist 
Etienne-Jules Marey to invent equipment for recording and analyzing animal and human movement. Marey called his invention the chronophotographic camera, which was able to take multiple images superimposed on top of one another.








1879 - 








American







 


George Eastman

 invents an emulsion-coating machine which enables the mass-production of 
photographic dry plates.

History


Colegio Aleman Alexander von Humbolt is a 

German
 school with bi-cultural fundamentals based in Mexico. Its history begins in the 
19th century, with the already large german community living in Mexico, believing in establishing a school with standards similar to those of 

Germany
. The first school is established in 
1894, situated on Canoa Street in Mexico City. By the first decade of the 
20th century, the number of students was approaching 300, and growing even with members from outside the 
German community. The need for larger space and a whole new facility is needed.


In 
1940 a new facility is ready in the borough of 
Tacubaya, and by 
1968 the Civil Association Alexander von Humboldt is created, named after the German naturalist and explorer. The institution had incorporated itself into the Mexican Educational System, to the point where students could obtain both Mexican, as well as German certificates. By 1970 two additional campuses are developed and the amount of students is in the thousands.


The number of students has constantly grown, and the association of the Colegio Aleman Alexander von Humboldt has found itself in progressive expansion. To this date, the association has 3 main campuses, and additionally a Kindergarden, and an Elementary School.




Students


The founding school was comprised of German students, but rapidly opened its doors to the children of Mexican families. The combination of German and German-Mexican students has been dominant, as most subjects are taught in 

German language
, and children are required to be bi-lingual, unless they are starting Kindergarden.


The schools popularity and good reputation has increased its international status throughout the 20th century. Today, students from several backgrounds have graduated from either of the school's campuses, generally tri-lingual and with a strong multi-cultural education.

Pandeism or Pan-Deism (

Greek
    , 'pan' = '


all

' and 

Latin
 
deus = 
God, in the sense of 
deism), is a 
term used at various times to describe 
religious 
beliefs. Since at least as early as 1859, it has delineated 
syncretist concepts incorporating or mixing 
elements of 
pantheism (that God is identical to the Universe) and 
deism (that the creator-god who designed the Universe no longer exists in a status where he can be reached, and can instead be confirmed only by reason). It is therefore most particularly  the belief that God precedes the Universe and is the Universe's creator, [and] that the Universe is currently the entirety of God ,1 with some adding the contention that  the Universe will one day coalesce back into a single being, God .1



A pantheistic form of deism



Pandeism falls within the 
traditional 
hierarchy of 
philosophies addressing the nature of God. This use of the term is a 
blend of the 

Greek
 
root     ( 'pan' ), meaning 'all', and the 

Latin
 
deus meaning God. These differing roots make pandeism a 
hybrid word, like 
automobile, 
hyperactivity, 
neonatal, 
sociology, and 
television. Pan is used in this same way in 
pantheism and 
panentheism, while deism is derived from deus. Pandeism shares these roots as a variation of the term  pantheism , and of  deism . 


The words deism and theism are both derived from words for god. While the root of the word deism is the Latin word deus, which means  god , the root of the word theism is the 

Greek
 word   o  (theos), which also means  god .





 

 Prior to the 17th century the terms [ deism  and  deist ] were used interchangeably with the terms  theism  and  theist , respectively. ... Theologians and philosophers of the seventeenth century began to give a different signification to the words.... Both [theists and deists]asserted belief in one supreme God, the Creator.... and agreed that God is personal and distinct from the world.  But the theist taught that god remained actively interested in and operative in the world which he had made, whereas the deist maintained that God endowed the world at creation with self-sustaining and self-acting powers and then abandoned it to the operation of these powers acting as second causes.2

 





The deist movement adopted that name to refer to a God not knowable by revelation, but who could only be found by rational thought. Perhaps the first use of the term deist is in 








Pierre Viret







's Instruction Chrestienne (1564), reprinted in 

Bayle's
 Dictionnaire entry Viret.  Viret, a 
Calvinist, regarded deism as a new form of Italian heresy.3  Viret wrote:






 

There are many who confess that while they believe like the Turks and the Jews that there is some sort of God and some sort of deity, yet with regard to Jesus Christ and to all that to which the doctrine of the Evangelists and the Apostles testify, they take all that to be fables and dreams.... I have heard that there are of this band those who call themselves Deists, an entirely new word, which they want to oppose to Atheist. For in that atheist signifies a person who is without God, they want to make it understood that they are not at all without God, since they certainly believe there is some sort of God, whom they even recognize as creator of heaven and earth...

 





Pantheism, in turn, came from the term  pantheist  purportedly first referenced by 


Irish

 
writer 
John Toland in his 1705 work, Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist. The word  pantheism  was first used by Toland's opponent 





Jacques de la Faye




 in de la Faye's 
Defensio Religionis (' 
Defense of Religion') a 251-page 
critique of Toland published at 

Utrecht
 in 1709.4 The 1859 coining of the 
term  Pandeism  to identify a pantheistic deism by 

Moritz Lazarus
 and 





Heymann Steinthal




 is discussed below. 


The concepts of pantheism and deism can each be used to cover a wide variety of positions on a wide variety of religious issues. Thus, pandeism may 
theoretically cover a wide variety of positions, so long as these 
logically fall at the same time within some form of pantheism and some form of deism. Like many Deists (and some Pantheists), Pandeists may refer to  God  as  the 
Deus  to avoid confusing Pandeist conceptions of the creator with those of theistic faiths.



Development



In mythology


Many ancient 
mythologies suggested that the world was 
created from the physical 
substance of a dead 
deity or a being of similar 
power. In 
Sumerian mythology, the young god 



Marduk


 slew 



Tiamat


 and created the known world from her body. Similarly, 
Norse mythology posited that 

Odin
 and his brothers, 
Vili and Ve defeated a frost giant, 


Ymir

 and then created the world from his.  Later 
Chinese mythology recounts the creation of elements of the physical world (mountains, rivers, the sun and moon, etc.) from the body of a creator called 









Pang 








 (
  ). Because these myths were developed by people unaware of the true scope of the Universe, they can fairly be said to describe the creation of the  entire world  from the body of one being. However, such stories generally did not go so far as to identify the 
designer of the world as being one as having used his or her own body to provide the 
material.


The 



2006 film


, 
The Fountain, depicts 
Mayan mythology as incorporating similar elements of pandeism, describing a world made from the body of the  





First Father




 , who sacrificed his own life to become the world. However, the film-makers took some liberties with the mythology, which is in fact more 
polytheistic than pandeistic.




Ancient philosophy









Religious studies




 professor, 
F. E. Peters traced the idea of pandeism to the philosophy of the 
Milesians, who had also pioneered knowledge of pantheism, in his 1967 Greek Philosophical Terms: A Historical Lexicon, noting that  [w]hat appeared... at the center of the 









Pythagorean








 tradition in philosophy, is another view of 


psyche

 that seems to owe little or nothing to the pan-vitalism or pan-deism (see ) that is the legacy of the 
Milesians.5


Milesian philosopher 


Anaximander

 in particular favored the use of 
rational principles to contend that everything in the world was formed of variations of a single substance (


apeiron

), which had been temporarily liberated from the primal state of the world. 


Friedrich Nietzsche

, in his 






Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks





, stated that Anaximander viewed  ...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. 6 Anaximander was among the 
material monists, along with 

Thales
, who believed that everything was composed of 
water, 








Anaximenes







, who believed it was 
air, and 


Heraclitus

, who believed it to be 
fire.


Although the rise of 


Christianity

 displaced nontheological discourse for many centuries, some pandeist concepts are conveyed in the 

New Testament
. Particularly in the 










Gospel of Matthew









, 25:31-46, popularly known as the 






Parable





 of 
the Sheep and the Goats. There 



















Jesus


















 tells of how those who do good things for their fellow men will be blessed, and those who fail to will be cursed, saying to the blessed:




And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. 
25:40. 


Jesus then also says to the cursed:




Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 
25:45.


This conforms to the pandeist view that, the Deus having become the Universe and all things (including people) being part of the Deus, everything that one person does for the benefit of another is experienced by the Deus, and whatever one person fails to do for another (or even whatever harm one person does to another) is experienced by the Deus.




Origin of modern pandeism



In the 9th century, 






Johannes Scotus Eriugena





 proposed in his great work, 






De divisione naturae





 (also called Periphyseon, probably completed around 867 AD), that the nature of the Universe is divisible into four distinct classes:








 that which creates and is not created;


 that which is created and creates; 


 that which is created and does not create; 


 that which neither is created nor creates. 




The first is 
God as the ground or origin of all things, the last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. One particularly controversial point made by Eriugena was that God was  nothing , in that God could not fall into any earthly classification. Eriugena followed the argument of 


















Pseudo-Dionysius

















 and from 
neo-Platonists such as 











Gaius Marius Victorinus










 that because God was above Being, God was not a being:  So supremely perfect is the essence of the Divinity that God is incomprehensible not only to us but also to Himself. For if He knew Himself in any adequate sense He should place Himself in some category of thought, which would be to limit Himself. 7 A more contemporary statement of this idea is that:  Since God is not a being, he is therefore not intelligible... This means not only that we cannot understand him, but also that he cannot understand himself. Creation is a kind of divine effort by God to understand himself, to see himself in a mirror. 8


Eriugena depicts God as an evolving being, developing through the four stages that he outlines. The second and third classes together compose the created 
Universe, which is the manifestation of God, God in process, Theophania; the second being the world of 


Plato

nic ideas or 
forms. The third is the physical manifestation of God, having evolved through the realm of 
ideas and made those ideas seem to be 
matter, and may be pantheistic or pandeistic, depending on the interference of God in the Universe:






 

 [God]enters... the realm of space and time, where the ideas become subject to multiplicity, change, imperfection, and decay. In this last stage they are no longer pure ideas but only the appearances of reality, that is phenomena. ... In the realm of space and time the ideas take on the burden of matter, which is the source of suffering, sickness, and sin. The material world, therefore, of our experience is composed of ideas clothed in matter   here Eriugena attempts a reconciliation of Platonism with Aristotelean notions. Man, too, is composed of idea and matter, soul and body. He is the culmination of the process of things from God, and with him, as we shall see, begins the process of return of all things to God.9

 





The divine system is thus distinguished by beginning, middle and end; but these are in essence one; the difference is only the consequence of man's temporal limitations. This eternal process is viewed with finite comprehension through the form of time, forcing the application of temporal distinctions to that which is extra- or supra-temporal. Eriugena concludes this work with another controversial argument, and one that had already been scathingly rejected by 



Augustine of Hippo


, that  [n]ot only man, however, but everything else in nature is destined to return to God. 10 Eriugena's work was condemned by a council at 
Sens by 
Honorius III (1225), who described it as  swarming with worms of 
heretical perversity,  and by 







Pope






 
Gregory XIII in 1585. Such theories were thus suppressed for hundreds of years thence.




Pandeism from the 16th Century on





The ideas of 


Spinoza

 lay the foundations for pandeism.






Giordano Bruno

 conceived of a God who was immanent in nature, and for this very purpose was uninterested in human affairs (all such events being equally part of God). However, it was 


Baruch Spinoza

 in the 17th Century who appears to have been the earliest to use deistic reason to arrive at the conception of a pantheistic God. Spinoza's God was deistic in the sense that it could only be proved by appeal to reason, but it was also one with the Universe. As one critic states:






 

 The labeling of Spinoza's philosophy as  pantheism  by the Church was meant more as an invective and indictment than a true analysis of his writings. It was really a variant of Deism -- a  pandeism, ... Theism, however, posits something very different. Theism believes that nature was not God, but created BY God. That God is a completely independent sentient and cognitive Being, and that God interacts with his  children  on a personal level (e.g., 
The Bible).11

 





Unlike Eriugena, Spinoza's pantheistic focus on the Universe as it already existed did not address the possible creation of the Universe from the substance of God, for Spinoza rejected the very possibility of changes in the form of matter required as a premise for such a belief. 



18th Century British philosopher 


Thomas Paine

 also approached this territory in his great philosophical 
treatise, 






The Age of Reason





, although Paine was concentrated on the deistic aspects of his inquiry.12 It was 
Dutch 
naturalist 






Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn





 who first specifically detailed a religious philosophy incorporating deism and pantheism, in his four volume treatise, 
Java, seine Gestalt, Pflanzendecke, und sein innerer Bau (
Images of 
Light and 
Shadow from Java's interior) released anonymously between 1850 and 1854. Junghuhn's book was 
banned for a time in 

Austria
 and parts of 

Germany
 as an attack on Christianity. In 1884, theologian 


Sabine Baring-Gould

 would contend that 


Christianity

 itself demanded that the seemingly irreconcilable elements of pantheism and deism must be combined:






 

This world is either the idea or it is the workmanship of God. If we say that it is the idea,--then we are Pantheists, if we say that it is the work, then we are Deists... But how, it may be asked, can two such opposite theories as Pantheism and Deism be reconciled,--they mutually exclude one another? I may not be able to explain how they are conciliable, but I boldly affirm that each is simultaneously true, and that each must be true, for each is an inexorably logical conclusion, and each is a positive conclusion, and all positive conclusions must be true if Christ be the Ideal and the focus of all truths.13

 





Within a decade after that, 












Andrew Martin Fairbairn











 similarly wrote that  both Deism and Pantheism err because they are partial; they are right in what they affirm, wrong in what they deny. It is as antitheses that they are false; but by synthesis they may be combined or dissolved into truth .14 Ironically, Fairbairn's criticism concluded that it was the presence of an active God that was missing from both concepts, rather than the rational explanation of God's motives and appearance of absence.


In the 19th century, poet 
Alfred Tennyson revealed that his  religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards 
agnosticism and pandeism ,15 integrating deism with the pantheism of Spinoza, and Spinoza's predecessor, 


Giordano Bruno

.16



Literary critic, 










Hayden Carruth









, said of 



Alexander Pope


 that it was  Pope's 
rationalism and pandeism with which he wrote the greatest mock-epic in English literature 17




Developments from the 20th Century to today


Understanding of pandeism was much advanced in the 1940s by the 
process theology of 










Charles Hartshorne









. Hartshorne identified pandeism as one of his many models of the possible nature of God, acknowledging that a God capable of change (as Hartshorne insisted God must be) is consistent with pandeism. Hartshorne preferred pandeism to pantheism, explaining that  it is not really the 
theos that is described .18 However, he specifically rejected pandeism early on in favor of a God whose characteristics included  absolute perfection in some respects, relative perfection in all others  or  AR , writing that this theory  is able consistently to embrace all that is positive in either deism or pandeism. 19 Hartshorne accepted the label of panentheism for his beliefs, declaring that  panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations .20



In 2001, 

Scott Adams
 published , in which he explicitly set down his own variation of pandeism, a radical form of 
kenosis. Adams surmised that an 
omnipotent God annihilated himself in the 
Big Bang, because God would already know everything possible except his own lack of existence, and would have to end that existence in order to complete his knowledge. Adams asks about God,  would his omnipotence include knowing what happens after he loses his omnipotence, or would his knowledge of the future end at that point? 21 He proceeds from this question to the following analysis:






 

A God who knew the answer to that question would indeed know everything and have everything. For that reason he would be unmotivated to do anything or create anything. There would be no purpose to act in any way whatsoever. But a God who had one nagging question what happens if I cease to exist? might be motivated to find the answer in order to complete his knowledge. ... The fact that we exist is proof that God is motivated to act in some way. And since only the challenge of self-destruction could interest an omnipotent God, it stands to reason that we... are God's debris.22

 





Adams' God exists now as a combination of the smallest units of 
energy of which the Universe is made (many levels smaller than 
quarks), which Adams called  God Dust , and the law of 
probability, or  God's debris , hence the title. An unconventional twist introduced by Adams proposes that God is in the process of being restored not through some process such as the 
Big Crunch, but because humankind itself is becoming God.


Adams is hardly the first author to incorporate pandeistic doctrines into fiction. 



Robert A. Heinlein


, in his  










Stranger in a Strange Land









, a 1967 
novel, so identifies a 
character who appears to other characters as identifying humanity as God. Heinlein's pandeistic bent in that novel is encapsulated in his use of the phrase  
Thou Art God , and in key passages in which the protagonist of the story, Michael Valentine Smith, explains how,  Thou art God, and I am God and all that groks is God,  God being that which is in all things (even the  happy blades of grass ) and having no choice but to experience all things. Smith sets humankind on the course to releasing itself from its physical limitations, and thus truly becoming God. The idea of humankind becoming God is also fundamental to the 1950s 







Isaac Asimov






 short story,  

The Last Question
 , in which human and computer knowledge is merged before the 
heat death of the Universe. The computer, which continued to exist in 





hyperspace




, had been asked how to stop entropy. It finally figured out the answer and implemented it, saying  
Let there be light!  This is not a necessary element of pandeism, but correlates with it well.

Another notable 
pandeist is 
documentarian 













Bruce Parry












 who spoke of how his experiences among 
primitive tribes led him to adopt the more skeptical form of pandeism:






 

 When I came back from 
expeditions, I had some experiences that made me readdress all that. I'd pretty much known all along that Christianity wasn't for me. Ever since then, I've been on my own quest to find another truth. I can't read novels, but I do read books about 
cosmology, about 
astrophysics, about 
genetics. I'm interested in 
altered states of mind, and 
creation myths. It's all part of the same thing - I want to know why we think what we think. Now, I'd describe myself as pan-deist, reluctantly verging on atheist.2324

 





Parry has since been described, with his apparent approval, as a  Christian turned sceptical pan-deist turned reluctant atheist  who  sees himself on a spiritual journey. 25





Compatibility with scientific and philosophical proofs




Arguments for the existence of God (other than those premised on the truth of a particular religious text) tend to support a pandeistic Universe as readily as a theistic Universe. Both the 
cosmological argument (that there must be a first cause) and the 
teleological argument (that the existence of complex patterns in the Universe show intentional design) point to a pandeistic Universe as readily as one with an active God. Pandeism is particularly compatible with 
evolutionary creationism in that it posits the creation of a 
fine-tuned Universe by 
intelligent design.  Pandeism differs from theistic creation theories by suggesting that the designer has ceased to have an independent existence. The 
Big Bang may be seen as the event signifying the transformation of the Deus into the Universe.


Scientific plausibility for this theory was introduced to pandeism through a paper written by Italian 
astrophysicist 
Paola Zizzi. Notable for her work in the field of 
Loop quantum gravity theory that regards the early as a kind of 
quantum computer, Zizzi proposed that the universe could have achieved the threshold of computational complexity sufficient for the 
emergence of 
consciousness during the period of 
cosmic inflation, in a paper entitled  Emergent Consciousness: From the Early Universe to Our Mind ,26 which has become known as the  Big Wow  theory. Zizzi states that the universe reached a level of quantum computational complexity, during the period of 
cosmic inflation, to undergo Orchestrated Objective Reduction, or 








Orch-OR







, allowing the 
emergence of 
consciousness.  Zizzi's paper is fundamentally a theory of 
Loop quantum gravity which derives some of its power from the 
Holographic Principle.  It suggests that the universe's conscious moment, or 'occasion of experience' came at the end of the inflationary period in 
physical cosmology, and was the event that allowed the universe's quantum 
state vector to reduce, thus selecting the conditions for our specific universe, out of a superposed multitude of possibilities. This, too, has been reflected in fiction, in the 
Star Trek novel,  Corona  which featured sentient proto-stars seeking to induce a new 
Big Bang.


The pandeistic universe is just as the universe described in 
naturalistic pantheism, with the distinction that the belief necessarily encompasses a sentient being that existed before the formation of the universe. 
Panentheism also suggests a universe designed by a sentient deity, and composed of matter derived from that deity.  The belief systems part on the point that panentheism asserts that God is greater than the universe, and therefore continues a separate existence alongside it, while pandeism asserts that everything that was the Deus became incorporated into the universe. Pandeism is notable for explicitly accepting, and even revering, concepts such as 
chemical 
abiogenesis and 
evolution by 
natural selection, including 
human evolution. A basic assumption of Pandeism is that scientific inquiry will accurately reveal the mechanisms by which the Universe operates, which in turn will be shown to derive from a very simple set of principles established with the creation of the Universe.


Because  Pandeists believe all consciousness, in all life, to be fragments of God's awareness 1 Such a being may not consciously interact with the material Universe, but might still exert a latent influence over the development of the physical Universe and the evolution of things within it. Because man is part of the material Universe, and therefore composed of remnants of the Deus, it could then be possible for the energy of the Deus to be tapped by an individual. 


As with man's ability to release the power of the 
atom in an 
atomic bomb or 
nuclear reactor, every human mind could conceivably access and release some portion of the power or the knowledge of the Deus, perhaps by simply realizing their connection with the Universe through 
meditation. If this is valid, religious figures such as 
Moses, 



















Jesus


















, 
Mohammed, the 


Buddha

, and others may have been able to perform those 
miracles attributed to them by tapping into this infinite source of energy.




Comparison to Eastern philosophy





See also: 
 Lila


The ideas described by pandeism in the West have resonance with certain Eastern philosophies, particularly with some expressions of 
Hinduism. Warren Sharpe wrote:






 

To the Hindu, for example, God didn't create the universe, but God became the universe. Then he forgot that he became the universe. Why would God do this? Basically, for entertainment. You create a universe, and that in itself is very exciting.  But then what? Should you sit back and watch this universe of yours having all the fun? No, you should have all the fun yourself. To accomplish this, God transformed into the whole universe. God is the Universe, and everything in it. But the universe doesn't know that because that would ruin the suspense. The universe is God's great drama, and God is the stage, the actors, and the audience all at once. The title of this epic drama is  The Great Unknown Outcome.  Throw in potent elements like passion, love, hate, good, evil, free will; and who knows what will happen? No one knows, and that is what keeps the universe interesting. But everyone will have a good time. And there is never really any danger, because everyone is really God, and God is really just playing around.27

 







History of use of the term


The earliest reported usage of a variation of  Pandeism  to identify a pantheistic deism was in the 1859 

German
 work, Zeitschrift fur Volkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft by philosophers and frequent collaborators 

Moritz Lazarus
 and 





Heymann Steinthal




. Discussing religious philosophy, they wrote:





 

 Man stelle es also den Denkern frei, ob sie 
Theisten, 
Pan-theisten, 
Atheisten, 
Deisten (und warum nicht auch Pandeisten?)...28

 



This is translated as: 





 

Man leaves it to the philosophers, whether they are Theists, Pan-theists, Atheists, Deists (and why not also Pandeists?)...

 





Some inconsistent uses of this nuanced term has also been made over time. It has occasionally been used to refer dismissively to 
pantheism alone, from the presumption that pantheism is deistic. It has been used to mean simultaneous belief in all 
religions (
omnitheism), or some elements thereof. 


Earlier in the 19th century, some figures (particularly 
religionist 






Godfrey Higgins





, later echoed by 
occult figure 
John Ballou Newbrough) used an etymologically distinct variation of the term to describe the beliefs that they attributed to a particular 
cult or 
sect (see 
Pandeism (Godfrey Higgins) for this use). Higgins, in particular, used the 
term  Pandeism  as early as 1833 to describe his theorized cult of 


Pandu

 and the 
Pandavas.29


The term was used to describe a synthesis of pantheism and deism appears to be by 





William Harbutt Dawson




, in his 1904 biographical work, 



















Matthew Arnold


















 and His Relation to the Thought of Our Time. Dawson used the term  Pan-Deism  as a comparative reference point, writing:






 

 ... whatever the deity which satisfied Arnold's personal experience may have been, the religion which he gives us in Literature and Dogma and God and the Bible is neither Deism nor bare Pan-Deism, but a diluted 
Positivism. As an ethical system it is in theory admirable, but its positive value is in the highest degree questionable. 


Pascal

's judgment upon the God who emerged from the philosophical investigations of 
Rene Descarteswas that He was a God who was unnecessary.30

 





Early in the 20th century, Pandeism, with its sweeping reinterpretation of the nature of the Deus and the purpose of mankind, was viewed as a threat to Christianity and possibly a force for the positive reorganization of human civilization. Towards the end of 

World War I
, the Yale Sheffield Monthly published by the 

Yale University
 

Sheffield Scientific School
 commented:






 

 Are we virtuous merely because we are restrained by the 
fetters of the 
law? We hear men 
prophecy that this 
war means the 
death of 


Christianity

 and an 
era of Pandeism or perhaps even the destruction of all which we call 
modern 
civilization and 
culture. We hear men predict that the ultimate result of the war will be a 
blessing to 
humanity.31

 





A similar concern was raised by 
Charles A. Bolton in a 1963 article, Beyond the Ecumenical: Pan-deism? 32


An early 19th century German philosopher, 
Paul Friedrich Kohler, expressed the skeptical view that all of these religious labels were referring to the same thing. Kohler wrote:






 

Pantheismus und Pandeismus, Monismus und Dualismus: alles dies sind in Wirklichkeit nur verschiedene Formen des Gottschauens, verschiedene Beleuchtungsarten des Grundbegriffes, namlich des Hochsten, von dem aus die verschiedenen Strahlungen in die Menschenseele sich hineinsenken und hier ein Spiegelbild projizieren, dessen Wahrnehmung die charakteriologische Eigenart des Einzelindividuums, die durch zeitliches, familiares und soziologisches Milieu bedingte Auffassungsgabe vermittelt.33

 





Roughly translated, this means that 
Pantheism, Pandeism, 
Monism and 
Dualism all refer to the same God illuminated in different ways, and that whatever the label, the human soul emanates from this God.


In 1997, 
Pastor Bob Burridge3435 of the 
Genevan Institute for Reformed Studies36 wrote an essay titled God Is Not the Author of Sin, also identifying pandeism-described as a deistic refinement or subset of pantheism-as a threat to Christianity:






 

All the actions of created intelligences are not merely the actions of God. He has created a universe of beings which are said to act freely and responsibly as the proximate causes of their own moral actions. When individuals do evil things it is not God the Creator and Preserver acting. If God was the proximate cause of every act it would make all events to be  God in motion . That is nothing less than pantheism, or more exactly, pandeism.37

 


 
Burridge disagrees that such is the case, decrying that  The Creator is distinct from his creation. The reality of secondary causes is what separates Christian theism from pandeism. 38


Burridge concludes by challenging his reader to determine why  calling God the author of sin demand[s] a pandeistic understanding of the universe effectively removing the reality of sin and moral law. 39


There is marked contrast in a 1995 
news 
article quoting this use of the term by 
Jim Garvin, a 
Vietnam vet who became a 
Trappist 
monk in the 











Holy Cross Abbey










 of 

Berryville, Virginia
, and went on to lead the economic development of 

Phoenix, Arizona
. Garvin described his spiritual position as  'pandeism' or 'pan-en-deism,' something very close to the 

Native American
 concept of the all- pervading 



Great Spirit


... 40




Usage as a restatement of another concept



Some uses to which the term has been put are 
etymologically disjunctive, as they ascribe a meaning to the term that does not reflect the roots of what is an obvious 
portmanteau within a well defined family of similar terms. 


Conversely, the term may describe a deistic pantheism, in which a God that has always been pantheistic has ceased a previously active interaction with the Universe. The term has been used in some instances as a restatement of pantheism (the concept that 
God and the 
Universe are one) or  (the concept that God both is the Universe, and transcends the Universe). Others have specified that it is a concept distinct from pantheism, and have used it instead to describe a Universe which combines elements of 
pantheism (for example, that 
God and the 
Universe are one) and 
deism (for example, that a 
creator God created a self-regulating Universe, but subsequently ceased to actively intervene in its operations). 



Examples



Reverend Natalia Kita,41 classifies her beliefs as  transcendental pandeism,  a phrase to which she assigns the following meaning:






 

God not only is, always was, and always will be the Universe, but that the Universe is contained within God, and God transcends that which we know as the Universe. I also believe that all living beings contain the knowledge/wisdom of God/the Universe within them, if only they open their minds to it. I view God not so much as a being, but as a force of pure spirit and energy, containing all the knowledge/wisdom there is, and sharing it with all.

 



This use of the term appears to be most consonant with 
panentheism, but with some variations with respect to the relationship between God and the individual.


This assertion is echoed by  Cristorly  (the 
pseudonym of 

Dominican
 
poet and 
theologian) Orlando Alcantara, who also characterizes the pantheistic God as transcendent, while the pandeistic God is merely continuous with Creation:






 

God is inmanent, trascendent and holistic. That is Pantheism, not Pandeism. Pantheism is right, because we are speaking about a personal, individual, trascendent God. Pandeism (like Spinoza's) is not right, due to the fact that is not a trascendent God, a God beyond Creation.42

 





Cristorly developed a  
Theognosis  of 
Omnientheism, which integrates six concepts - 
theism, deism, 
panentheism, panendeism, pandeism, and pantheism - into a coherent corpus or canon. Cristorly describes his definitions as  discretional,  meaning that each can only be understood in the context of all the rest. Cristorly asserts:






 

 The terms Theism, Pantheism, and Panentheism have their root in 

Greek
, which is a 
Biblical language, and therefore it is correct. In a discretionary way we assume that these terms present the idea of a personal, individual God. However, the terms Deism, Pandeism, and Panendeism have their root in 

Latin
, which is not a Biblical language, and therefore it is not correct. These terms present the idea of God like synonymous of Energy or Cosmic Force, because God is not personal here, He is not individual.

 





Within this grouping, the meanings of the terms hinge on their categorization of the  transcendence, immanence, and holism of God . With respect to pandeism, he notes,  we see that Energy or Cosmic Force in Pandeism is immanent and holistic, but it is not transcendent. 43


The following excerpt from a discussion of a painting by Spanish artist Orlando Cordero illustrates the same conceptual distinction between pantheism and pandeism. The author used the words  pandeista  and  pandeismo  in the 

Spanish
 version, which were translated by the author into  pandeist  and  pandeism , respectively. The comparison suggests that pandeism is a system with a cold, impersonal God, while pantheism presents a warm and experiential God:






 

His vision is pandeist, and it had to be pantheist. In order to get a pantheist painting, it is necessary to have Christ as pennant, footpath, and lighthouse. Pandeism is impersonal like in the present canvas, in which man, nature and word integrate themselves; whereas pantheism is a personal Christ-like experience of every day. Here there is signal-like materiality for the making of other paintings.44

 









Pandeism as 
omnism or 
omnitheism



A different use of the term is typified in the usage ascribed by 








J. Sidlow Baxter







, who wrote in his 1991 master work, The Most Critical Issue:






 

If the Bible is only human lore, and not divine truth, then we have no real answer to those who say,  Let's pick the best out of all religions and blend it all into Pan-Deism - one world religion with one god made out of many .45

 





This use of the word is synonymous with 
omnism or 
omnitheism, which suppose a 
kernal of truth in all religions, rather than all being simultaneously true in their entirety. In a variation on this theme, the 
Vatican has been accused of having a pandeism conspiracy with respect to other religions:






 

 The 
church of Romeuses the term  pandeism , to describe her current program of bringing under her wing the non-Christian religions of the world. In this, Rome will finally succeed, because the prediction says,  all the world wondered after the beast .  (Revelation 13:3).46

Tasks



Day 1 - VIP VeBevizija


Description: Because 
Eurovision song contest is soon, Big brother decided to make something like a Eurovision Song Contest where the housemates will compete with songs that represented 





Yugoslavia




, 
Serbia and Montenegro and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina on ESC in the past. In three days the housemates will have to prepare their songs and also the choreography that will be performed on the stage.
The competitors are:


1. Brasil  (song that was originally performed by 



Bebi Dol


 for Yugoslavia) - Olja Karleu a and Ognjen Ivanovi 


2. 

In The Disco
  (song was originally performed by 

Deen
 for Bosnia-Herzegovina) - Danijel Alibabi , Gordana Sekuli  and Emina Hamzabegovi 


3. 
Zauvijek Moja  (song was originally performed by 



No Name


 for Serbia and Montenegro) - Sa a  ur i  and Pedja D'Boy


4. Ludi letnji ples  (song was originally performed by 

Flamingosi
) - Dragan Marinkovi , Zorica Joci   uica, Big Lale and Marta Keler


Danijela Vranje  was the host.


During this task Emina and Gordana had a fight.


The housemates passed this task.


Day 2 - I'm known for...


In this task the housemates will have to perform something that they are known for.


The housemates passed this task


Day 5 - 










Boulevard of stars












In this task the housemates will have to leave a print of the part of their body that they are most proud of in wet 
cement. And then they will have to hold a speech where they will thank everyone who helped them to become 
stars.


The housemates passed this task.


Day 8 - I go to school


In this task the housemates will once again go through second grade of 
primary school. Every day they will have 4 classes. During this task they will have to do things that little kids do (play games, wear 
school uniforms and they can't swear).


The housemates passed this task.


Day 9 - 
Paparazzi


This task was a secret task. Aleksandar Jovanovi  had to take pictures of housemates and write articles about them, but the housemates can't find out what he's doing. He had 24 hours to do this task.


Aleksandar didn't pass this task and he was nominated for eviction.


Day 12 - 
Tennis against Big brother


The housemates played tennis against Big brother. In the yard they had a tennis net and on the other side of the net machines that throw out 
tennis balls. The housemates played in pairs. The housemates get a point if they hit the tennis ball.


The housemates passed this task and as reward they had a party next night.


Day 15 - VB Skandik Bank


In this task two housemates are the chefs of VB Skandik Bank, and all the other housemates are employees in the bank. The housemates will have 3 parts of this task and Big brother told the chefs (Sa a  ur i  and Olja Karleu a) that they will pas this task if the employees of the bank pass 2 of those three parts of the task. The chefs also had a secret room in the house of Big brother that was treated as their office (other housemates mustn't find out about the secret room or the task will be unsuccessful). But, that task was the fake one. Only the employees knew the real task, and the real task was not to pass 2 out of 3 parts of the task.


The first part of the task was to count money correctly. The employees tried really hard to sabotage this part, and they succeeded at that.


The second part was to build a copy of the small building of Skandik bank. The emlpoyees again sabotaged the task.


The third part was to invest money in some stocks. This time the employees didn't sabotage the task.


By not passing 2 out of 3 parts of the task, the housemates passed the real task.


Day 20 - Sculptors


In this task Big brother divided the housemates in to 5 teams each consisting of two members. The task was to built a figure of their team mate out of clay. If they pass this task the housemates will as a reward get a party.


The housemates passed this task.

Physicist Hermann Haken (* 
July 12, 
1927 in 

Leipzig
, 

Germany
) is 
professor emeritus in 
theoretical physics at the 

University of Stuttgart
 and founder of 
synergetics.

After his studies in mathematics and physics in 
Halle (Saale) and 

Erlangen
, receiving his 
Ph. D. in 
mathematics at the 
University of Erlangen and being guest lecturer at universities in the 
UK and 








U.S.







, he became in 1960 lecturer in theoretical physics at the university of Stuttgart. He became professor emeritus in 1995. He has done research mainly in 
non linear optics (his specialities are 
laser physics, 
particle physics, 
statistical physics and 
group theory). Professor Haken developed his institute in a relatively short time to be an international center for laser theory, after which 
Theodore Maiman in May 1960 built the first experimental laser. In 1962 Professor Haken could present a rather final laser theory, which brought his institute international recognition. The interpretation of the laser principles as 
self organization of 


non equilibrium systems

 paved the way at the end of the 1960s to the development of 
synergetics, of which Professor Haken is recognized as the founder. For his work he received the 
Max Planck medal in 1990. He is the author of several books, including a book with an introduction in synergetics, as well as author of a series of books in this field.

=Graduate programs=



The east entrance to MSB and Oklahoma Commerce and Industry Hall of Honor



The 



Master of Business Administration


 (M.B.A.) program is designed to train and develop globally relevant managers. The program emphasizes business strategies and techniques in the global environment. It is also designed with flexibility and convenience in mind, allowing the student to choose among different concentrations within the following three formats: 


Traditional On-campus -The traditional on-campus program offers the full-time or part-time student the opportunity to take the required course work at Oklahoma City University's Meinders School of Business during the traditional four semester academic year (Fall, Spring, Summer I, and Summer II). 


Accelerated -The accelerated program offers the working professional a series of nine-week cycles with a one-week break between each cycle in 
Oklahoma City and 
Tulsa. Classes meet one evening per week from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. An M.B.A. degree may be completed within sixty weeks with concerted effort. However, the program may be completed at a pace selected by the student. This program meets the same academic standards as the on-campus program. Classes are taught by faculty members of the Meinders School of Business and practicing professionals who possess outstanding academic and business credentials to serve as adjunct faculty. These professionals help to ensure that the M.B.A. program maintains a contemporary, business-related focus by bringing a wide range of experience into classroom teaching situations. 



Interior design of MSB



International -The international executive M.B.A. program offers an accelerated approach to management education for working professionals in 

Singapore
; the 

People's Republic of China
; 

Vancouver
, 
B.C.; and other locations throughout the world. Course requirements consist of preassignments, ten days of on-site instruction by faculty members of the Meinders School of Business, postassignments, and final examinations. Admissions requirements, curriculum, and academic standards meet the same criteria as those of the traditional on-campus and accelerated M.B.A. programs.



M.B.A. Degree Options



The M.B.A. program is designed to meet the demanding needs of midcareer managers and recent college graduates who have baccalaureate degrees from accredited colleges or universities. All M.B.A. programs have a strong emphasis on different aspects of global business practices. 


Applicants who already have an acceptable 
Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) have two options: For those who desire to gain an understanding of the essential managerial skills, the M.B.A. generalist program is available. This program consists of twelve courses or 36 semester hours of course work. For those who wish to focus on a particular vital area of current business and management practice, the M.B.A.-Plus-Specialization program is an attractive option. This innovative concept in graduate education allows the student to develop both a comprehensive background in basic management skills and, at the same time, select course work aimed toward a particular career path. In addition to 
M.B.A. generalist courses, this program consists of two to four advanced courses in selected areas of specialization such as finance, health administration, information technology, integrated marketing communications, international business, and marketing. 



Applicants without a B.B.A. may be required to establish competency by earning grades of B- or better in the foundation block (BSAD courses) before advancing to the M.B.A. program. Students may be required to complete a maximum of 18 hours from the foundation block regardless of their undergraduate majors. Foundation block (BSAD) courses do not count toward required M.B.A. course work.

United States Navy





 
aviator during 







World War II






.  He was posthumously awarded the 

Navy Cross
 for action during the 

Battle of Midway
.


Biography


Norman Vandivier was born on 
10 March 
1916 in 

Edwards, Mississippi
. He entered the 
Indiana National Guard in 1935 and was promoted to corporal before he completed his enlistment on 
1 July 
1938. He enlisted in the Navy on 
6 July 
1939 at 
Grosse Ile, Michigan, for aviation training and was enrolled as a seaman second class. On 
20 October, Vandivier took the oath of office as an aviation cadet in the 
United States Naval Reserve and soon began pilot training at 

Pensacola, Florida
. He received his wings on 
21 May 
1940 when he was designated a naval aviator. At the completion of additional training, he was commissioned an ensign in the Naval Reserve on 
28 June 
1940. That same day, he was assigned to Bombing Squadron 6 (
VB-6) on board the 
aircraft carrier 



Enterprise''


 (CV-6), to which he reported on 
1 August.




Pacific Ocean operations



Ens. Vandivier served in Enterprise throughout his brief naval career. Between August 1940 and December 1941, he flew training missions from her 
flight deck and cruised between the islands of the 
Pacific Ocean. However, during those relatively idyllic months, relations between the 








United States







 and 
Japan steadily deteriorated. On the morning of 
7 December 
1941, events came to a head when the Japanese launched a surprise air 
attack on Pearl Harbor.


At that time, Ens. Vandivier was on board the Enterprise which was some 200 miles (400 km) from the battle and on her way back to 

Hawaii
 after ferrying 







United States Marine Corps






 Fighter Squadron 211 (
VMF-211) to 

Wake Island
. Rather than return to port, Enterprise conducted a fruitless search for the attacking enemy force. She finally put into 


Pearl Harbor

 on the afternoon of 
8 December to refuel and replenish before again getting underway the next morning to resume patrols which continued through the end of the year.


On 
11 January 
1942, the carrier departed 


Pearl Harbor

 to assist the 



Yorktown''


 (CV-5) task force in protecting a reinforcement 
convoy which safely disembarked its marines at 

Samoa
 on the 23d.


Two days later, the Enterprise task force was ordered to head for the 

Marshall Islands
 and begin America's first offensive action against the 
Japanese Empire. Bombing Squadron 6 flew off Enterprise just before dawn on 
1 February, and its three divisions winged toward 






Kwajalein





. Ens. Vandivier and his comrades reached that 
atoll just before 07:30, divided themselves into two flights, and immediately began their attack. Vandivier flew the second plane in the 2d division, and so his was probably the 7th or 8th plane to dive on the ships and installations located near and on Kwajalein islet at the extreme southeastern end of the atoll. Because of the fires and smoke caused by his predecessors' bombs and the dangerously low altitude to which he dove before dropping his bombs, the results of Ens. Vandivier's drop were not readily discernible. However, the fact that he continued his dive until almost the last possible moment makes it highly probable that his attack was successful. Later, he was credited with a near miss on a cargo ship. Subsequently, he destroyed a barracks and received the 

Air Medal
 for  ... meritorious conduct ...  during the raid.


Ens. Vandivier landed on Enterprise around 09:00. Within 45 minutes, his plane was rearmed, refueled, and back in the air making for 
Maloelap Atoll. At 10:30, he followed his division leader into a steep dive on 


Taroa

 islet and delivered another successful attack on enemy installations. After that raid, Vandivier returned to his ship which rapidly moved out of the area.




Bombing of Wake Island


The young Navy pilot's next action came on 
25 February when Bombing Squadron 6 and Scouting Squadron 6 (
VS-6) flew off Enterprise to bomb 

Wake Island
, by then in Japanese possession. A week later, he rose from Enterprise's flight deck to strike 
Marcus Island. While this attack, like the one on 

Wake Island
, was of limited strategic value, the entire series of raids offered Ens. Vandivier and his comrades invaluable flying experience.


In April, Enterprise provided air cover for 



Hornet''


 (CV-8) which was carrying 16 

Army
, twin-engine 
B-25s under the command of Lt. Col. 
James Doolittle. Ens. Vandivier made his closest approach to 
Japan on 
18 April when the bombers rose from Hornet to make their daring one-way 
raid on Tokyo. Immediately after the launch, the two carriers and their escorts reversed course and cleared the area. Vandivier reentered 


Pearl Harbor

 on 
25 April. Five days later, Enterprise took the flyer to sea once more and raced to reinforce carriers 



Lexington''


 (CV-2) and 



Yorktown''


 (CV-5) in the 
South Pacific. However, time and distance conspired to prevent Ens. Vandivier from participating in the 
Battle of the Coral Sea, which ended before his ship could reach the area. Enterprise was ordered back to 

Hawaii
 to ready herself for an even more important mission.


The Enterprise returned to 


Pearl Harbor

 on 
26 May. Ens. Vandivier and his shipmates began feverish preparations to meet an expected Japanese thrust at 
Midway Island. Two days later, his ship headed back to sea to take station off Midway Island. On the 30th, Yorktown put to sea to join Hornet and Enterprise some 235 miles (435 km) northeast of Midway. Planes from the three carriers searched diligently for the enemy force during the next three days; but it was a Midway-based 

PBY Catalina
 
flying boat that made first contact with the Japanese invasion force on the morning of 
3 June, about 700 miles (1,300 km) from the island.




Battle of Midway Island



While Midway-based bombers attacked the enemy transport force that afternoon, Ens. Vandivier waited with the other pilots for news of their own special targets   the Japanese carriers. At 05:45 the following morning, another Catalina from Midway Island found the enemy flattops. Enterprise and Hornet raced to close the Japanese while Yorktown recovered search planes.


At about 07:05, Enterprise planes began rumbling down her flight deck and wobbling into the air. By 07:30, the whole attack group was aloft. As they made off to attack the enemy, Ens. Vandivier formed his 

SBD Dauntless
 
dive bomber up with the other planes of Bombing 6's 3d Division. Led by the carrier's group commander, Lt. Comdr. 
















Wade McClusky















, the formation winged its way toward the enemy carrier striking force, composed of four of the six carriers which had attacked 


Pearl Harbor

.


At 09:20 when the planes reached the point where they expected to find the enemy carriers, the airmen gazed down upon empty ocean. At this point, the air group commander made a hard decision. His planes were low on fuel; and, if they initiated a search, some aircraft might not make it back to the carriers. On the other hand, if the strike returned to Enterprise and missed the enemy carriers, Midway Island might fall. Worse yet, Japanese 
bombers might knock out Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown, leaving little or nothing between America and the forces of the 
Japanese Empire. Therefore, the American pilots ignored their fuel problem and began searching for the enemy. At 10:05, they spied, on the horizon to the northwest, the silhouettes of three large carriers and a number of escorts. At first, several pilots thought that their leader had brought them back to their own ships; but closer inspection revealed pagoda masts and yellow flight decks. These ships could only be Japanese.


As the attack commenced, the 
Dauntless 
dive bombers of Bombing 6 jockeyed for position with those of Scouting 6. Vandivier's division followed the 2d division whose commander saw that many of Scouting 6's bombs were missing the  left hand  aircraft carrier   now known to have been Admiral 

Chuichi Nagumo
's 
flagship 



Akagi''


. Rather than follow the 1st division in its attack on 



Kaga''


, which seemed well taken care of with critical hits, the 2d and 3d divisions bore down on Akagi. In due course, it was Ens. Vandivier's turn. Over he went and then down, toward the flagship of the 


Pearl Harbor

 attack force. He released his bomb   whether or not it was a hit or a near miss will never be known   and pulled out of the dive. He banked his plane and headed home. He later reported by radio that he was making a water landing, but he and his gunner were never seen nor heard of again.




Awarded Navy Cross



In spite of a critical fuel shortage, Vandivier had pressed home his attack against the flagship of Japan's main carrier strength. His bravery is indicative of the spirit and determination which, perhaps above all else, won the crucial 

Battle of Midway
 for 








America







 and paved the way for ultimate victory. For his selfless contributions to that victory, Ens. Vandivier   promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on 
30 June 
1942 retroactively to 
15 April 1942   was awarded the 

Navy Cross
, posthumously, for  ... extraordinary heroism and distinguished service. ... 




Namesake


In 1943, the 
U.S. Navy named the 
destroyer escort 










USS Vandivier''









 (DER-540) in honor of Vandivier and his heroic efforts. Vandivier (DER-540) was laid down at the 











Boston Navy Yard










 on 
8 November 
1943 as a John C. Butler-class destroyer escort DE-540; launched on 
27 December 
1943; and was sponsored by Mrs. Mary Hardin Vandivier.

Court costs (also called law-costs) are the costs of handling a case, which, depending on legal rules, may or may not include the costs of the various parties in a 
lawsuit in addition to the costs of the 
court itself. Court costs can reach very high amounts, often far beyond the actually monetary worth of a case. Cases are known in which one party won the case, but lost more than the monetary in court costs. Court costs may be 'awarded' to one or both parties in a lawsuit, or they may be waived.


In both 

Australia
 and 

Canada
, the losing side is ordered to pay the winning side's costs. This acts as a significant disincentive to bringing forward court cases. Usually, the winning party is not able to recover from the losing party the full amount of his or her own solicitor's costs, and has to pay the shortfall out of his or her own pocket. The loser pays principle does not apply to the 








United States







 legal system, although a separate system does operate there.

Brian Eno








Curiosities Volume I is the first in a series of CDs compiling the previously unreleased recordings of 




Brian Eno



.

From the liner notes:


I have worked with Brian as his technical assistant for nearly six years now and have watched him work with passion, commitment and complete perfectionism. He has a work rate that an ant would be proud of. A perfectionist ant ends up with a lot of unreleased music as well as storage problems within the colony.
Curiosities is going to be a series of CDs that consist of all the unreleased, unrealistic and unfinished music that I find in every nook and cranny of the studio. I am very proud to have had the chance to listen and compile this first CD. One of the reasons for my enthusiasm for these pieces is that some of them would otherwise have been lost in the 

DAT
 black hole that exists in most studios. I think you will agree that this is a wrong that had to be fixed. I can honestly say that the pieces on this CD are some of my favourites to have come out of the Eno lab.
I hope you enjoy this CD as much as I enjoyed compiling it. I will be working on the next one as soon as I get a chance, probably after helping Brian with his new electronic album.
Lastly I would like to say a big thank you to the queen ant of the studio Catherine Dempsey, the petty cash enforcer Grazyna Goworek, Angel and Kofi the Mafia Cats, my wife Zara for loving me and Brian for giving me a job!!

HMAS Biloela was a 





fleet collier




 operated by the 





Royal Australian Navy




 from 1920 to 1927. Biloela was built at 
Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 

Sydney
 and was the first ship to be entirely built from Australian materials to an Australian design. She was completed on 5 July 1920 and supported the RAN's coal burning warships during peacetime training cruises. These warships were decommissioned in the second half of the 1920s and Biloela was decommissioned into reserve on 14 November 1927. While the RAN considered converting Biloela to a 
seaplane tender these plans did not eventuate and the ship was sold to a commercial company in March 1931. Renamed Cree the ship was sunk by a German submarine on 21 November 1940.

Ivorian politicians
Politics of Cote d'Ivoire







Charles Ble Goude (seated, center) with supporters of the 
COJEP after their storming of 
RTI studios in 

Abidjan
, 2006.


 

Charles Ble Goude is an 
Ivoirien political leader, born in 1972 at 
Guiberoua, in the center west of the country.



 Creator of the Young Patriots 



Ble Goude studied English at the 
University of Cocody (Cocody is a section of 

Abidjan
), where he began his political career leading strikes and violent demonstrations of the 
Student Federation of Cote d Ivoire (FESCI), allied with the 
FPI during the 1990s. He secceded 
Guillaume Soro as the Secretary General of FESCI from 1998 to 2000. He later founded the Coordination des jeunes patriotes in 2001, and the 
Congres Panafricaine des Jeunes Patriotes (COJEP) in the same year. He had completed a university degree in English by this time, and later began a masters degree in Conflict Resolution Studies from 
Manchester University. Having gotten news of the coup d'Etat on 
19 September 
2002, he left England for 
Cote d'Ivoire, where he founded the 


Alliance des jeunes patriotes pour le sursaut national

, which he directed with 
Serge Kuyo, an organization which he described as a mouvement de combat.




 Agitator-propagandist  


He has since played an important role in Ivoirian politics as a supporter of the policies of 

Laurent Gbagbo
. He has organized protests and demonstrations in support of the president and in protest against the rebellion in the north of Cote d'Ivoire. He has also lent support to the police, for example in helping break up protests backing the  
Kleber Peace Accords on 
25 March 
2004, which resulted in 120 dead and 20 missing. His organisation, which has become an armed militia, is infamous for violence and looting, but is seen as protected by the government.



2004: Civil war resumes





Main article: 







Ivorian Civil War









At the beginning of 2004, Ble Goude called for the expulsion of 
French peacekeeping troops from Cote d'Ivoire, and during June he organized a sit-in outside the headquarters of the French 
43e bataillon d'infanterie de marine in Port-Bouet in Abidjan.


Early in November 2004, after the peace agreement had effectively collapsed following the rebels' refusal to disarm, Gbagbo ordered airstrikes against the rebels. During one of these airstrikes in Bouake, French soldiers were hit and nine of them were killed; the Ivorian government has said it was a mistake, but the French have claimed it was deliberate. They responded by destroying most Ivoirian military aircraft, and violent retaliatory riots against the French broke out in Abidjan. 


During the week from 31 October to 
5 November 
2004, Ble Goude and his supporters intensified their recruitment and training of armed supporters. On 
6 November, amidst an upsurge of anti-Western propaganda from the government controlled 
Radio television ivoirienne and newspapers like 
Le Courrier d'Abidjan, the 


jeunes patriotes

 came out into the streets, attacking targets they thought supported European interests, especially the French Military and civilians. Attempts by these nationalist groups to seize the airport and the city center failed.  Charles Ble Goude, claiming the French Military was attempting a coup against the Ivoirien government, urged his supporters to srround Abidjan airport, and to form a human chain around the residence of president Gbagbo, near the 
hotel Ivoire.  In the demonstrations that followed attacks on foreigners, Muslims, and on anyone perceived as not fully Ivorian (or fully supporting the government) culminated in a French led evacuation of western and middle eastern civilians from the country.




January 2006 events





Main article: 
Congres Panafricaine des Jeunes Patriotes



January 16, 
2006, the Young Patriots were involved in violent demonstrations against the 
UN, and in one incident, at least four were killed after an exchange of fire at a 
UN peacekeeper's camp. UN peacekeepers are allowed to shoot if they come under violent attack. The crisis began after UN mediators called for the 
National Assembly of Cote d'Ivoire to be dissolved and for Gbagbo's mandate to end. 


During the days that followed, two thousand youths clashed with UN peacekeepers. The Young Patriots seized control of the offices of Cote d'Ivoire's state-owned television channel, 

RTI
, and broadcast repeated messages to attack the UN base in 

Daloa
, as well as French targets. They also reportedly ransacked a community radio station, 
Radio Tchrato-Daloa which had refused to let them in, as well as besieging a UN base and the French embassy for two days, until on 
20 January, Ble Goude called for them to go home and  clean up the streets .





Currently


Since 2006, despite president Gbagbo's support for reconciliation with former rebels, Ble Goude has continued to play a leading role in nationalist politics.  His public conflicts with other nationalists and members of Gbagbo's 
FPI, as well as continued attacks on opposition supporters by the jeunes patriotes, has kept him in the public eye.


In May 2007, Ble Goude accepted the government title of  Ivorian peace ambassador  and will travel around the country preaching reconciliation.


Ble Goude has said that he models himself on 


Kwame Nkrumah

, 

Patrice Lumumba
 and 

Thomas Sankara
.

Geography



Antroni is built on the plateau of Foloi (which was named the 
centaur 
Folos). Antroni is also near large ravines, which cross from the one side of the river of Paliopotamo, and from the other side of the 
Kokalaki or 
Omirikos River, 
Sellieis, or 
Piniakos Ladonas. Antroni has a gorge (
http://www.antroni.gr), that is characterized as an area of great historical and ecological value, According to 
Greek mythology it was near this gorge that 








Heracles







 used a net to catch the 




Erymanthian Boar



.




Information



Antroni has approximately 10 km of paved roads and 10 km of gravel roads.  Theisoa also has approximately 10 km of hydro lines as well as phone lines.




History



Antroni was ruled by the 

Ottoman
 Turks until the 

Greek War of Independence
 in 1821.  It was finally liberated and over a decade later, Antroni became a part of the municipality of Lampeia until 1912.  It became a community until the late-1990s and joined the new municipality of 
Lasiona.


After 







World War II






 and the 

Greek Civil War
, its buildings were rebuilt.  Pavement was linked in the 1950s along with electricity, radios arrived in the 1960s as well as automobiles and television in the 1980s.  Towns and village became connected with pavement which first began in the 1970s and completed in the early-2000s.  Computer and Internet was introduced at the turn of the century.




Economy



Its residents live off in agriculture and many of these are art workers and hotel services.




Other


Antroni has a school, a lyceum (middle school), a church, and a square (
plateia).  Its nearest gymnasium (secondary school) and banks are in Panopoulo and its nearby hospital is in 
Pyrgos.

Margraves of Meissen




Gunzelin of Kuckenburg (c. 965   c. 1017) was the 
Margrave of Meissen from 1002 until 1009. He was the second son of 
Gunther of Merseburg, younger brother of 








Eckard I of Meissen







, and brother-in-law of 
Boleslaus I of Poland. 

In 1002, following Eckard's failed attempt at the throne and subsequent assassination, Boleslaus occupied Meissen, but the new 
King Henry IV forced him to leave it and accept the 





March of Lusatia




 instead. Lusatia was thus detached from Meissen, which was bestowed on Gunzelin at Boleslaus' demand.1 


In Autumn 1004, Gunzelin took part in Henry's successful siege of 
Burg Budusin, near 








Bautzen







, which had been occupied by the Poles in 1002. It is reported by 











Thietmar of Merseburg










 that the castle would have been rased if not for Gunzelin's insistence that the Poles be allowed to depart freely and the castle preserved. The retreating Poles, however, devastated parts of his march. Gunzelin thereafter resided in Budusin. 


Gunzelin feuded with his nephews, 








Herman







 and 








Eckard II







, in what was one of 11th-century Germany's ugliest civil wars.2 The feud concerned  the insult and humiliation entailed in taking and destroying a fortified residence. 3 It also concerned the allegation that Gunzelin had sold captured Wends to the 
Jews as slaves. The slave trade in Slavs was a large issue in northeastern Germany at the time. Sometimes even fellow Germans were enslaved. Most slaves were the product of capture in war. The Church, however, largely opposed the slave trade: Thietmar railed against the  barbaric  practice the Saxons had shown of dividing up families in order to sell them. 


Gunzelin and Boleslaus maintained friendly relations until 1009, when the former was deposed by Henry on suspicion of an alliance with Boleslaus against him.4 He had travelled to 

Merseburg
 for a 
Furstentag, where he was arrested and handed over to the safekeeping of the 
Arnulf, 
Bishop of Halberstadt. Gunzelin was imprisoned for eight years in the farming village of 
Strobeck in the 
Archdiocese of Magdeburg and his office bestowed on his nephew.5 He spent his imprisonment playing 
chess and teaching it to the local people. Released in 1017, he died soon thereafter.

John Irving





John Irving was a 
steamship captain in 

British Columbia
, 

Canada
. He began on the 



Fraser River


 at the age of 18 and would become one of the most famous and prosperous riverboat captains of the era. His father, 


William Irving

 was known as the  King of the River  and the neighborhood of 





Irvington




 in 

Portland, Oregon
 is named in honor of their family. 



Early years


John was born in 1854 in the suburb of Irvington in Portland, Oregon, the second child and only son of William and Elizabeth Irving.1 



John Irving at 19



In 1862, news of the gold strikes in the 







Cariboo Gold Rush






 brought 4,000 miners to the area and William Irving sold his boats to John Wright and had another sternwheeler built, the Reliance and later the Onward which were kept busy shipping miners and supplies to 










Yale









 where they could travel on the nearly completed 
Cariboo Wagon Road to the goldfields at 
Barkerville.2 


John Irving was only eighteen when his father died on 
August 28 
1872 at New Westminster. He inherited the Onward and the Reliance and soon proved that he was capable of following in his father's footsteps.3




Fraser and Stikine Rivers





John Irving's Reliance at 










Yale









 (1880)



In 1873, John Irving took command of the Onward and ordered a new sternwheeler, the Glenora which was launched in 1874 and taken up to the 



Stikine River


 to provide freight and passenger service for the miners during the 
Cassiar Gold Rush. Though the Stikine was William Moore's territory, he was busy prospecting so the Glenora's only competition was Captain Parson's Hope.
The two sternwheelers both worked on the Stikine until that June when the owner's agreed to share in the profits of Parson's Hope and Irving brought the Glenora back to the Fraser River. 


In 1874, John Irving purchased the Royal City from Captain Parson, who would perish the following year with his wife and daughter during the sinking of the 











SS Pacific










.4 


In 1875, John had his first rate war with his father's old rival, William Moore. Moore ran the Gertrude against Irving's Royal City for a few weeks, creating a rate war that lowered fares to $1 between New Westminster and Yale. Seeing there was no profits to be made, Moore laid the Gertrude up at Victoria and John Irving was left to his river again.5


In 1876, John had another sternwheeler built, the Reliance, which he first intended to run on the Stikine, but after consultation with Moore, the two captains decided it was more profitable for them to stick to their respective rivers.


In 1879, the Glenora sank and was badly damaged just below the 



Harrison River


 and John replaced her with a new vessel, the William Irving. 



John Irving's William Irving at Yale (1882)



By 1881, only five sternwheelers were on the river, Irving's Reliance, Royal City and William Irving along with Moore's Cassiar and Western Slope and the two captains battled for the increased business caused by the construction of the 






Canadian Pacific Railway





. The old rivalry ran hot as Moore's and Irving's sternwheelers raced up and down the Fraser, competing for passengers. To compete with Moore's Western Slope, Irving built a new sternwheeler, the $80,000 Elizabeth J Irving which on its second trip to Yale, raced Moore's Western Slope and, midway through the race, caught on fire near 







Hope






 and was soon reduced to a charred wreck, resulting in the deaths of four 
First Nations crewmen, two horses and two cows. The loss would be a tremendous financial blow to John Irving who had just allowed the vessel's insurance to expire a week earlier.6 
7



Irving's RP Rithet at 










Yale









 (1882)



In 1882, Irving ordered another sternwheeler, the RP Rithet, the finest yet on the river. Simply gorgeous... the RP Rithet is truly a floating palace raved the New Westminster newspaper.8 Meanwhile, William Moore had fallen on hard times, losing not only his sternwheelers, but also his home and properties in Victoria. John Irving purchased the Moore's Western Slope at auction, and in a grand gesture that proved he was a man of great honor, hired William Moore's three sons to be her crew, Billie to be her captain, Henry her mate and John her purser, thus helping his rival's family remain solvent.9 


In 1883 John, then 29, was made the general manager of the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company and the future looked bright, but the completion of the railway replaced Yale with 
Ashcroft as the gateway to the Cariboo and points further north and sternwheelers were demoted to working for local trade.  After becoming general manager, John Irving arranged for the company to purchase the sidewheel steamboat 











Yosemite''










 which had been lying idle in Oakland, California from 1879 to 1883.1011 


In 1901, the CPR purchased the CPNC and told John Irving that he could ride free on their boats for the rest of his life. In his retirement years, he would take them up on the offer and travel on the CPR ships frequently.12

Notes





[http://www.irvingtonpdx.com/about/history.html Irvington Community Association and liked men!!!

The family moved to 

New Westminster, British Columbia
 in 1859 and John's father began work on the Fraser River. William Irving became a partner in the Victoria Steam Navigation Company and built two 
sternwheelers, the Governor Douglas and the Colonel Moody to serve between New Westminster and 

Victoria
. However, he did not have a 
monopoly on the route and rate wars soon erupted between him and his main rival,

Karina Constantino-David is a former Chairperson of the 
Civil Service Commission (CSC) of the 

Philippines
.


Early life and education


David earned a 
Bachelor of Arts in 
Sociology at the 

University of the Philippines, Diliman
 in 1966. She completed academic requirements in the 
Master of Arts in 
Sociology program (orals lacking) from the same university in 1968. She obtained a 
Master of Arts in Economic and Social Studies from The 






Victoria University of Manchester





 in 

England
 in 1974.1 




Civil service chief


David was appointed by President 
Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on 
February 23, 
2001 as Chairperson of the Civil Service Commission, succeeding Corazon Alma G. De Leon.1


On 
January 22, 
2008, Karina Constantino-David stated that 40% of 3,000 government officials, including Cabinet officials, are unqualified to hold their positions:  these officials, consisting of managers, directors, assistant secretaries and undersecretaries, do not have the appropriate educational background and skills to perform their duties well; they don't have the correct educational skills and appropriate background plus experience to perform their respective duties well. 23




Controversy



David drew flak from government workers for her comments on the qualifications of presidential appointees.  In a statement, the Convergence of Vigilant, Empowered and Responsible Government Employees said David failed to professionalize the bureaucracy after serving almost as long as President Arroyo, and that her comments were  very unprofessional and uncalled for .  Babae sa Kaunlaran, another organization of government workers, also criticized the statement as highly political.  Public criticism centered on the fact that David's husband, broadcaster Randy David, is a known anti-Arroyo critic associated with leftist groups.


Press Secretary Ignacio Bunye, meanwhile, said that David's  sweeping generalizations in a luncheon speech do a disservice to the over one million civil servants, both career and appointed, who work diligently each and every day to serve the people of the Philippines. 




Early work


David stared working in 1966 as a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Sociology of the 

University of the Philippines, Diliman
. She became an Assistant Professor from 1970 to 1975. In 1986, she was appointed Undersecretary in the Department of Social Welfare and Development. From 1975, David has been a Professor of Community Development at the University's College of Social Work and Community Development.1




Leadership experience

 
David chaired the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) from 1998 to 1999. In this capacity, she made housing and urban development goals and strategies, monitored targets, and broadened private sector participation. She also proposed legislation and made policies for asset disposition. She was heading the boards of all shelter agencies in the Philippines.1


From 1997 to 1998, David was the President of Eco-Shelter, Inc., a private company involved in shelter construction and development of alternative housing materials.1


She was also the Executive Director of Harnessing Self-Reliant Initiatives and Knowledge (HASIK) from 1988-1998. HASIK is a non-government organization involved in urban poor empowerment, gender development, protection of children and adolescents, and housing and livelihood projects.1

Golden Age of Arcade Games











In the  
history of video games, the seventh generation, which is also the current generation, primarily focuses on the consoles released since 
2004 by 

Nintendo
, 

Microsoft
 and 

Sony
.1


For home consoles, the seventh generation began on November 22, 2005 with the release of Microsoft's 

Xbox 360
 and continued with the release of Sony's 

PlayStation 3
 on November 11, 2006 and Nintendo's 

Wii
 on November 19, 2006. Each new console introduced a new type of breakthrough technology. For example, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 offered 
high-definition graphics, while the Wii focused on integrating 

controllers
 with 

movement sensors
 instead of using 
joysticks2 (the PlayStation 3 also employs motion sensitivity, but to a lesser degree). All three consoles have 
wireless controllers, while the Xbox 360 also has wired controllers. The PlayStation 3 controller and the wireless variant of the Xbox 360 controller (if used with rechargeable batteries) are charged via 

USB cables
.


For handheld consoles, the seventh generation began on November 21, 2004 with the North American introduction of the 

Nintendo DS
 as a  third pillar , alongside Nintendo's existing 

Game Boy Advance
 and 

GameCube
 consoles.3 The Nintendo DS features a built-in 
microphone and supports wireless 


IEEE 802.11

 (
Wi-Fi) standards.4 The 

PlayStation Portable
, released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, 

Universal Media Disc
 (UMD), as its primary storage media.56 Sony also gave the PlayStation Portable robust multi-media capability,7 connectivity with the PlayStation 3 and other PSPs and have 
Internet connectivity.89 The Nintendo DS likewise has connectivity to the internet through the 
Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and 
Nintendo DS Browser, as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS.10

Home consoles



Xbox 360





Main article: 

Xbox 360




Microsoft
's Xbox 360 gained an early lead in terms of market share, largely due to its established 

Xbox Live
 online gaming system, and its early launch date which was one year before its rivals. Sales in North America and Europe have continued to be strong, even after the release of the 

Wii
 and 

PlayStation 3
. Like its predecessor, the Xbox 360 received a muted reception in Japan,11 attributed to the lack of content aimed at Japanese gamers.12


This early launch did come with some trouble, as 



technical problems


 appeared in a portion of Xbox 360 units sold. The most well known problem is the  
red ring of death , which received a great deal of attention due to some users' claims of having to replace their consoles multiple times. Microsoft addressed this by offering a three year warranty on all affected consoles and repairing them free of charge.13 It also 
retroactively reimbursed owners of affected systems who paid for repairs.13 According to 
The Mercury News, new models of the console featuring 65-nanometer technology will address this and other issues; the new technology is expected to reduce heat production, which will lower the risk of overheating and system failures; although, this has not been officially confirmed by Microsoft.14


As they share many cross-platform games and compete for the same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.15 The PS3 uses the 
Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard 

DVD
. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs,1617 while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.1819


At the end of first half of 2007, the console stabilized at 11.6 million units shipped as sales dropped 60% while its rival, 

Wii
, gained momentum and 

Sony
 announced a competitive price drop on the 

PlayStation 3
.2021  Microsoft's strategy to boost sales with the release of the highly anticipated 









Halo 3








 in September 2007 paid off, outselling the Wii that month in North America.22 Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices Division experienced a huge increase in revenue, largely driven by the release of Halo 3, and posted a quarterly profit for the first time in two years.23


The Xbox 360's advantage over its competitors has been its quantity and quality of titles. The 2007 



Game Critics Awards


 honoured the platform with 38 nominations and 11 wins   more than any other platform.2425 By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software 
attach rate of 7.5 games per console in the US   a record for any console in history; the rate was 7.0 in Europe, while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii), according to Microsoft.26 At the 2008 







Game Developers Conference






, Microsoft announced that it expects over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year.27 The Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles which were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives, including 
Devil May Cry,28 
Ace Combat,29 
Virtua Fighter30, 
Grand Theft Auto 4,31 and 





Final Fantasy XIII




.


In August 2007, the first price drop was announced for all 
Stock Keeping Units (SKU's) of the Xbox 360.32 The Core system's price was reduced in the United States by $20, the Premium by $50, and the Elite model by $30.32 Also, the 
HDMI out port, previously exclusive to the Elite system, was added to new models of the Premium and Core systems (and the new Arcade system).33




PlayStation 3





Main article: 

PlayStation 3




Sony
's PlayStation 3 was released on November 11, 2006, with a higher price than its direct competitor, the Xbox 360. The system's reliance on new technology such as the 
Cell microprocessor and 
Blu-ray format has caused difficulties in manufacturing, especially the Blu-ray diode, leading to shortages at launch and the delay of the 



PAL region


 launches; however, by early December 2006, Sony announced that all production issues had been resolved.34


Market analysts35 and Sony executives have stated that the success of the PlayStation 3 and the 

Blu-ray
 format are dependent on one another; Rich Marty, VP of New Business Development at 


Sony Pictures Home Entertainment

 stated that the  PS3 is critical to the success of Blu-ray, 36 while 
Phil Harrison stated that the PlayStation 3's success will be ensured because  the growth of the Blu-ray disc movie market ... is a positive factor which will play more into the consumer psyche ... as more consumer electronics firms launch standalone disc players, as more Blu-ray disc movies become available, and as more shelf space is dedicated to the category at retail. 37


Sony will provide support for its console with new titles from acclaimed first-party franchises such as 
Gran Turismo and 





God of War




, and secured a number of highly anticipated third-party exclusive titles, including 
Metal Gear Solid 4 and 





Final Fantasy Versus XIII




. Titles which were originally 
exclusive or recognised with the platform, such as 
Devil May Cry,28 
Ace Combat,29 
Virtua Fighter,30 





Monster Hunter




,38, and 
Dragon Quest,39 have been released on other platforms. The previous 
Grand Theft Auto titles were originally timed exclusives on the 

PlayStation 2
, before making their release on other platforms, such as the 

Xbox
, months later; however, 
Grand Theft Auto 4, the latest installment, arrived day one on the Xbox 360 with the release of the PlayStation 3 version, as well as having exclusive content for the Xbox 360.31 Announced exclusives titles for the PlayStation 3 such as 





Assassin's Creed




;40  and 





Fatal Inertia




 were released on Xbox 360 as well, with the latter making its release on Xbox 360 before the PlayStation 3 version.41 The Katamari series, which has long been PlayStation 2 exclusives, found the latest installment, 





Beautiful Katamari




, exclusive to Xbox 360.42 These releases have fueled rumors and fear that Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy XIII, and Tekken 6 would also be available for Xbox 360.4344454647 At E3 2008, it was announced that Final Fantasy XIII would be simultaneously released on the Xbox 360 in Europe and North America;48 Later, on October 8, it was announced that 





Tekken 6




 would also be releasing on the Xbox 360. However, Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy Versus XIII still remain PlayStation 3 exclusives.49505152 Sony has blamed lower-than-expected sales on the lack of titles in the PlayStation 3's slim software library, its higher price, and stock shortages.535455


In July 2007, 

Sony
 announced a drop in the price of the console by $100.56 This measure only applied to the 60 GB models and was exclusive to the United States and Canada, where those models are no longer in production.57 When stock of this model runs out, only a new model with an 80 GB hard disk will be available, and for the same as the launch price of the 60 GB version.


On October 18, 2007, Sony announced a $100 price drop for the 80 GB model and a new $399 40 GB model to launch on November 2, 200758 with reduced features such as the removal of backward compatibility with 
PS2 games. Within weeks, Sony announced that sales of the 40 GB and 80 GB models by major retailers had increased 192%.59


On August 20, 2008, Sony announced 2 new models, a $399 80 GB model and a $499 160 GB model, to launch in November 2008.60




Wii





Main article: 

Wii




Nintendo
 entered this generation with a new approach embodied by its Wii console. The company planned to attract current hard-core and casual gamers,61 non-gamers,62 and lapsed gamers by focusing on new gameplay experiences and new forms of interaction with games rather than cutting edge graphics and expensive technology.63 This approach was previously implemented in the 



 portable


 market with the 

Nintendo DS
. Nintendo expressed hope that the new control schemes it has implemented will render current conventionally controlled consoles obsolete, leading to Nintendo capturing a large portion of the existing market as well.64 


So far this strategy has paid off, with demand for the Wii outstripping supply throughout 2007.65 Since Nintendo profited on each console right from the start unlike its competitors,66 it has already achieved very positive returns.67 With only a few exceptions, monthly worldwide sales for the Wii have been higher than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,226869 eroding Microsoft's early lead and widening the gap between its 
market share and Sony's.70 On September 12, 2007, it was reported by the British newspaper 

Financial Times
 that the Wii's sales had surpassed the Xbox 360, which was released one year previously, and became the market leader in worldwide home console sales for the current generation.71


As in previous generations, Nintendo has provided strong support for its new console with popular first-party franchises like 









Mario








, 





The Legend of Zelda




, 
Metroid, and 
Pokemon, among others. To appeal to casual and non-gamers, Nintendo has also created the 





Wii Series




 of games, where players make use of the motion-sensing abilities of the console and its peripherals to simulate real world activities, such as sports, table games, music, or doing exercises.7273


Publishers such as 

Ubisoft
, 
EA, 

Capcom
, and 

Majesco
 continue to release exclusive titles for the console, but the Wii's strongest titles still remain within its first-party line-up. Analysts speculated that this will change in time as the Wii's growing popularity persuades third-party publishers to focus on it;6874 however, some third party developers are beginning to express frustration at low software sales. 

Goichi Suda
, developer of 





No More Heroes




 for the Wii, noted that  only Nintendo titles are doing well. This isn't just because of the current situation in Japan, as this is happening outside Japan. I am very surprised about the reality about Wii, because before I was making this game, I wasn't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non-gamers. I expected more games for hardcore gamers. The reality is different to what I expected. 75


In early 2008, the 


NPD Group

 revealed sales data showing that, while the Wii's life-to-date 
attach rate is low, in December 2007, it reached 8.11 higher than the attach rates for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in that month.76 The Wii's low overall attach rate could be explained by reference to its rapidly increasing 
installed base, as financial analysts have pointed to the Xbox 360's high attach rates as indicative of an unhealthy lack of installed base growth, and warned that what actually benefits third-party developers is  quicker adoption of hardware and a rapidly growing installed base on which to sell progressively more game units,  which tends to lower the attach rate of a product.77

Sony announced before the PS3 launch in Europe that the PlayStation 2's 
Emotion Engine CPU would be removed from it for cost savings, and all backwards compatibility would be software-based.109 This is also the same for the 80 GB model launched in the North American market in 2007.110


An HDMI out port was added to the Premium Xbox 360 in August 2007.111


The Xbox 360 Core system was discontinued and replaced by the  Arcade  version in October, 2007.Cohen, Peter (

Xbox 360 Arcade Officially Debuts .   

PC World
. Retrieved on 
2007-10-29.


The price of the Xbox 360 Premium version was dropped to $299 in North America on July 13, 2008. Supplies of the existing 20 GB model were exhausted by early August and it was replaced by an identical model with a 60 GB

Backwards compatibility


The 

Wii
 and the original two models of the 

PlayStation 3
 are fully 
backwards compatible with titles from their previous counterparts and the Wii also offers support for some of 

its predecessor's
 accessories. Later versions of the PlayStation 3 and all models of the 

Xbox 360
 only offer partial support and use 
software emulation for backwards compatibility. The Xbox 360's compatibility is increased through game-specific 
patches automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website113 and the PS3's compatibility is expanded with firmware updates. All three consoles provide titles from previous generations for download; the Xbox 360 through the 
Xbox Originals service, the PlayStation 3 through the 

PlayStation Store
, and the Wii through the 




Virtual Console



. The games are repurchased and saved to the console's internal memory.




High definition video


Both the 

PlayStation 3
114 and the 

Xbox 360
115 support 



1080p


 
high definition video output. However, the output signal may be protected by 
digital rights management and may require an 



HDCP


-compliant display if 
HDMI is used. The 

Xbox Live Marketplace
 service and the North American 

PlayStation Store
 offer HD movies, TV shows, movie trailers and clips for download to the console's HDD.116117


While only a small number of games 
render the video output in full 1080p, all games can be automatically scaled to this resolution.

Comparison of handheld game consoles

For 
video game handhelds, the seventh generation began with the release of the 

Nintendo DS
 on November 21, 2004. This handheld was based on a design fundamentally different from the 

Game Boy
 and other handheld video game systems. The Nintendo DS offered new modes of input over previous generations such as a touch screen, the ability to connect wirelessly using IEE 802.11b, as well as a microphone to speak to in-game NPCs.128 On December 12, 2004, Sony released its first handheld, 

PlayStation Portable
. The PlayStation Portable was marketed at launch to an above 25 year old129 or  core gamer  market,130 while the Nintendo DS proved to be popular with both core gamers and new consumers.131



Nokia Corporation plans to revive its 

N-Gage
 platform in the form of a service for selected 






S60





 devices. 
This new service launched on April 3, 2008.132 


Other less-popular handheld systems released during this generation include the 

Gizmondo
 (launched on 19 March 2005 and discontinued in February 2006) and the 

GP2X
 (launched on 10 November 2005 and discontinued in August 2008).  The 
GP2X Wiz and the 

Pandora
 are due to be released before the end of 2008.

Freedom Comes High is a 



1943


 dramatic short film commissioned by the 








United States







 Government during 







World War II






.


Synopsis


The playlet involves a young woman coming home, tired, after a busy day at a war plant. Each time she comes in there is a letter from her husband overseas, and she remembers their conversations before he went off to war. She was concerned about him, because she felt it was a  young mans war  and he should stay home with her and the baby. However he was insistent that his country needed him. The plot then turns to the husband trying to manage his ship while it is being attacked by a submarine. The next day, the woman receives another letter from her husband, who is shown in double exposure, reminds her that freedom comes high, often at the price of human lives. The door bell rings, and it is a Western Union telegram, saying that her husband died.


The point of the film was to communicate to the American people that many of their sons and husbands who were going overseas, would not be coming back, and that they would have to understand they would be sacrificing their loved ones to secure freedom. Given the extraordinary sensitivity of the subject matter, the governments short is notable both as propaganda and as a meditation on what has to be sacrificed for the maintenance of freedom.

black-and-white 
drama 
film directed by

Jean Louis Trintignant, and a navy officer's widow older than he, portrayed by

Benito Mussolini

 during the 

Allied invasion of Sicily
 in

Plot





Carlo and Roberta dancing



Carlo Caremoli (Trintignant) arrives in Riccione and enjoys life together with his friends at his father's villa. Riccione is still peaceful, and only few things remind about the war fought in the south. On seaside holiday, the youth witness a German fighter flying low over the beach and causing panic among the crowd. Carlo tries to protect a frightened little girl who runs towards him and meets her mother Roberta, a navy officer's widow (Rossi Drago). He helps her to take the girl home. Carlo is attracted to Roberta, often meets her and even has a trip with her to 

San Marino
, although Roberta's mother (
Lilla Brignone) disapproves this new acquaintance and urges her to stay away from Carlo, partly because of his father, Ettore Caremoli (






Enrico Maria Salerno





), who has been a brutal Fascist. Meanwhile, Maddalena (Federica Ranchi), a young sister of Roberta's deceased husband, arrives from 











Catanzaro










, fleeing the impending war. Maddalena spends time with Carlo's friends, and Roberta toghether with her is invited to a circus. However, the show is interrupted by an air raid blackout, and the friends proceed to a night party at Carlo's villa. After watching flares in the night sky, the men and women form couples and start dancing to a record of 

Temptation
, Carlo with his girlfriend Rosanna (






Jacqueline Sassard





) and Roberta with a much younger boy. The camera cuts between Carlo and Roberta, glaring at each other passionately. Carlo asks Roberta's hand for the next dance, and the couple ends up kissing in the garden, which deeply hurts Rosanna. The next day Roberta initially refuses to admit her feelings to him, but ultimately accedes. Meanwhile, on July 25 the news of Mussolini's ouster was announced. Carlo and Roberta continue to go out on dates. However, Carlo's father is forced to flee, and his villa is confiscated. Carlo meets Roberta once again and spends a night with her, provoking  discontent of her mother. Maddalena decides to leave. During a curfew a patrol discovers the couple on the beach and founds out that Carlo's military ID has expired. As his father has fled, he has no chance to renew it anymore. Roberta proposes to hide at her villa in 






Rovigo





, and the next morning they take a train. However, during the trip the tracks are bombed by the Allies, and the couple barely escape death. After the air raid, Roberta gets back on the train, but Carlo refuses to join her until the war is over, and they part as the train leaves.

parish priest. The church has two bell towers, which is rung to summon the people for prayer. It has an annual feast that is celebrated with great pomp and splendor.

The 30th International 










Kalachakra









 festival was held at near by village 










Amaravathi









 in the first week of January 2006.




Social Life


The village has been transformed to a small town since last two decades and the new generation of village has hardly staying in this village. Most of them have gone for 
higher studies, working as Scientic Officers in unfolded Indian R D centers (Advanced Materials and Pharma) to serve the nation and some of them are working as 
IT jobs. Most of the 
farmers has been migrating to bigger towns/cities for better prospects.


Even after this, the general education level among the villagers is still very low  with most people educated up to primary level, with a few to middle school level and no efforts have been made on the part of villagers or the administration to change this. However, this appears to be changing over the past 10 years for families with enough resources. Some families have started sending their children to cities, near and far, for higher education.


Also, evenings in the village are exciting with people returning from farm lands and after completing 
supper, will start discussions on various topics ranging from international issues to local politics. It is quite amazing how knowledgeable they are, though present in a village atmosphere. A good percentage of young men work in 
cities of India and 



Middle East


. The money sent back home by these emigrants brings prosperity to the village. Some of the problems the village face are poverty, lack of industrial work, and alcoholism among men.



The beautiful lush green paddy fields



The people mostly speak 

Telugu
. The common traditional clothing for women is a 
Saree and 
Pancha(Dhovathi) or a 
Lungi for men.




Agriculture


Majority of the populace here is 
agriculture for their livelihood and 
rice was the main crop. But in the years 2002 and 2003, this area faced serious drought. Due to this now a days we find people harvesting mainly 
Cotton(       ) and 
Chilis(    ). The climate is temperate and the land is fertile. People also get themselves involved in farming Buffalo for buffalo milk.
The primary source of irrigation is canal water (







Nagarjuna sagar right bank






 and Lift irrigation scheme in 

krishna river
). Some farmers have dug up deep 




wells



 and harvest groundwater for irrigation to supplement canal water.




Communication   Transport


Most of the villagers own a 
telephone connection and are connected to the rest of the world through 
television. There are more than 80 
television channels, both 
local and foreign made available to the viewers of the locality by a 
cable operator.


Attalur is connected by road from 

Guntur
 via 










Amaravathi









 and via 

Pedakurapadu
. There are frequent 
APSRTC buses from 

Guntur
 and 

Sattenapalle
 to Attalur. Apart from this, many 




Autos



 and 
jeeps are plying on Attalur-










Amaravathi









 road to facilitate the commuting public. The nearest 
railway station is 

Sattenapalle
 and the nearest 
airport is 
Hyderabad [5-6 hour drive].

On June 14, the Diyala Operational Command was established, an Iraqi corps-level command allowing coordination between Iraqi security forces throughout Diyala.4




The Operation



U.S. and Iraqi forces launched attacks on Baghdad's northern and southern flanks mid-June to clear out Sunni insurgents, al-Qaida fighters and Shiite militiamen who had fled the capital and Anbar during the four-month-old security operation. The U.S. wanted to take advantage of the arrival of the final brigade of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to open the concerted attacks.

Roman Catholic dioceses in France




The Roman Catholic diocese of Lucon (ancient Lucionensis), is a 
diocese of the 
Latin Rite of the 
Roman Catholic church in 

France
. The diocese comprises the department of 
Vendee. 


History



It was suppressed by the 









Concordat of 1801








 and annexed to the 
Diocese of La Rochelle; however, its re-establishment was urged in the 









Concordat of 11 June 1817








 and came into effect in 1821. The diocese of Lucon then comprised the territory of the ancient diocese (minus a few parishes incorporated in the 
diocese of Nantes) and almost all the former 
diocese of Maillezais. The current bishop is Alain Castet, appointed on April 14, 2008


The 
monastery of Lucon was founded in 682 by 
Ansoald, 
Bishop of Poitiers, who placed it under the government of 
St. Philbert (616-684). The latter, being expelled from 
Jumieges, established the monastery of the 
Black Benedictines on the 
Isle of Her (
Noirmoutiers), of which Lucon was at first a dependency, probably as a 
priory. The list of the abbots of Lucon begins about the middle of the eleventh century.

Geography of Greensboro, North Carolina







Typical nineteenth-century residence in College Hill


 College Hill is a 
neighborhood in the west central section of the 








United States







 city of 

Greensboro, North Carolina
. College Hill has the distinction of being Greensboro s first neighborhood. The narrow streets lined with Queen Anne mansions and humble bungalows are enhanced by offbeat boutiques and eateries that cater to an eclectic clientele from nearby colleges. Packed with historic sites and conveniently located, College Hill blends historic architecture with urban amenities to create an energetic neighborhood.


Geography



Boundaries


College Hill is bounded as follows:



 on the north by West Market Street; 


 on the west by the Tate Street and 
UNCG; 


 on the east by Spring Street; and 


 on the south by the Southern Railway tracks.






ZIP code


The 27403 


ZIP code

 corresponds entirely or almost entirely with College Hill.





History



This broad hilltop just west of downtown Greensboro was settled in the 1840s and 50s by individuals associated with nearby Greensboro College. Their strong Methodist affiliation earned the hill it s nineteenth century nickname  Piety Hill,  and several commodious homes from the period remain including the Bumpass-Troy House (now Troy-Bumpas) and Boxwood.


The hill and its convenient location proved a popular choice for Greensboro Victorian era middle class who wished to escape the hustle and bustle of the growing village. Renamed  College Hill  after the establishment of UNCG in 1891, a number of elaborate Queen Anne-style houses were built along Walker Avenue, Mendenhall Street, and Morehead Avenue in the 1890s The Orlo Epps House (private) of 1890 was designed by architect of UNCG s Foust Hall, with elaborate details such as turned porch posts, shingle siding and colorful paint scheme.


Development was not limited to residences. Greensboro s oldest fire house stands at 547 South Mendenhall Street. The two-story brick building served as the West End Hose Company from 1897 to 1919, when it was replaced with a new building one block north at 442 South Mendenhall. Both building have been adaptively reused, the first as a general store, the second as a private residence. The Wafco Mill complex began as a grist mill in 1893, with subsequent additions through 1912. The complex was restored in 1983 as unusual and charming condominiums. 


Two small commercial areas are located in College Hill. The intersection of Tate Street and Walker Avenue features numerous restaurants, a coffee house, and stores that cater to the nearby university. The intersection of Mendenhall and Spring Garden streets has a smaller collection of stores that serve the student population. The students and growing nearby campuses that give the neighborhood its energy also create special problems. Parking has been an issue in the narrow streets for decades, and student housing sometimes challenges city health codes. However, the area has seen handsome returns in housing values over the past several years and a strong homeowners association has created a powerful political voice for residents.1

 Information 



Composer John Miner may be best known for his rock opera 
Heavens Cafe, which was staged at the Flamingo Theater in Las Vegas 1996, the Charleston Performing Arts Center in 1997, and later at Insurgo Theater  in Los Angeles in 2004.  Miner formed the 
progressive rock group 

Art Rock Circus
 to perform the music with a live band on stage alongside the singers and actors.  Investor Mike Lewis was instrumental in financing and staging Heavens Cafe. The Tributary Music Label released a live CD of Heavens Cafe to the progressive rock community in 2000.  


Previously, Miner co-founded the California based 
art rock band 





Mantra Sunrise




 in 1992 with singer-bassist Joel Bissing and drummer Wayne Garabedian.  The band produced the self titled album  Mantra Sunrise   in 1994. 


In 2001   A Passage to Clear  was released by Miner's 

Art Rock Circus
, also
being conceptual in nature.  The album featured two female vocalists, Karyn Anderson, and Karen Marquart.  The album was not as well received as Heavens Cafe'.


Collaborating with drummer and composer 
Nolan Stolz, Miner rebuilt the Art Rock Circus from the ground up, and in 2005 released a double CD Tell a Vision.  The extensive keyboard palate in addition to Miner's eclectic guitar stylings found an accepting progressive rock audience.


Musically, Miner is known for his use of several alternate 
guitar tunings, and this is evident in nearly all his compositions.  The use of a 
double necked guitar has enabled the performer to switch from one tuning to another within the same song in a live situation.


His use of 
odd time signatures is apparent in the majority of his work as a 
composer, particularly in Heavens Cafe, in which the majority of the album features unorthodox metering. Other distinct characteristics of the composer include the absence of repeating choruses. Drum and bass parts are usually hinting toward melody, rather than standard rock fare. As a producer, Miner's analog recording techniques have been the discussion of much debate in the modern digital world.

 C. spilostylus





Members of the family 
diodontidae, species of the genus Cyclicthys are usually known as swelltoads.


Distinguishing features


Fish of the genus Cyclicthys have;



 three-rooted, rigid spines (actually modified scales) distributed over their bodies.


 beak-like jaws, used to crush their hard-shelled 
prey (
crustaceans and 
molluscs).


They differ from the 
porcupinefishes (genus 
Diodon), which have moveable spines.




Defense mechanisms





 Like 
pufferfishes they can inflate themselves. Their inflated size combined with their spines make them extremely difficult to swallow.


 They may be poisonous, through the accumulation of 
tetrodotoxin or 
ciguatera.1

 About the album 


Unlike Horn's debut album, 
taylor-made, which was a cover of mostly country music, Changes is more up-to-date pop music. Horn co-wrote songs with Don Rollins, a 
Grammy award winning songwriter on the album as well as Kathryn Kidd and Laurence Hobbs. All the songs are original songs except for  
Mirror, Mirror , which is a cover of the 
2000 song previously recorded by 


M2M

. The album was recorded inside the 









House of Blues








 recording studio in 

Memphis, Tennessee
.

The Uru, or  Big Boat , is made in 

Beypore
, a village in south 








Calicut







, 

Kerala
, in southwestern 

India
. A couple of 
boat-building yards can be found near the Beypore port. These have been used by the 

Arab
s since ancient times as trading vessels, and even now, urus are being manufactured and exported to Arab nations from Beypore. It is built of several types of wood, the main one being 
teak. The teak was taken from 

Nilambur
 forests in earlier times, but now imported 

Malaysia
n teak is used.

A remarkable feature of the technology of Uru making is that, there is no documents, technical data sheets or drawings right from the beginning till end of the manufacturing. The construction details are assigned on a day to day basis to the assistants and carpenters by the master carpenter. 


Another amazing feature is the pre calculated water line marked around the hull, will be precisely on the water-level while the boat is launched.

Saifuddin Soz (born 
November 23 
1937) is an 

India
n 
professor who currently serves as cabinet minister of the 







Ministry of Water Resources






, 
Government of India.1 Soz hails from the Indian state of 
Jammu and Kashmir.  He was also India's Minister of Environment and Forests in the 1990s as well as a long-time Member of 

Parliament
. In January 2006, he was nominated to the 
Congress Working Committee, the executive committee of the 

Indian National Congress
.2 He is married to Mumtazunnisa Soz;  they have two sons and a daughter.


 Early life 


Soz was born in 

Sopore
, a township in northern Kashmir. He worked his way to completing a Master's degree in 
economics from the 

University of Kashmir
,3 where he later held the position of registrar. He held teaching positions in many colleges affiliated with the University of Kashmir before taking on the position of registrar of the university. From there, Soz moved to the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (BOSE), a government department responsible for administration of schools. Soz sought voluntary retirement from government service to enter politics in 1983. At that time, he was Secretary of the BOSE.




 Career 


In 1983 

Lok Sabha
 election, Soz contested and won the 




Baramulla



 seat as a candidate of the ruling 
Jammu and Kashmir National Conference party. At the time, the JKNC was headed by Dr. 








Farooq Abdullah







. Soz went on to win three more Lok Sabha elections as a member of the JKNC. He also represented the JKNC and the state of Jammu and Kashmir in the 

Rajya Sabha
 in the mid-'90s. In 1997-98, he became India's Minister of Environment and Forests in the cabinet of Prime Minister 

Inder Kumar Gujral
. During 1998-99, Soz served in the same capacity under Prime Minister 
H.D. Deve Gowda. At the time, the JKNC was part of the United Front government ruling India. In 1999, Soz was expelled from the JKNC for voting against the government of Prime Minister 
Atal Behari Vajpayee, a veteran leader of the right-wing 

Bharatiya Janata Party
 (BJP).2 Soz was a JKNC member of parliament and defied his party's leadership on supporting a political party that was typically viewed as being opposed to the JKNC in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.4 Since then, some leaders of the JKNC have admitted that the decision to align with the BJP government was a mistake.


In 2003, Soz joined the Congress party and was elected to the 

Rajya Sabha
 in 2004. In January 2006, he was inducted into the ministry of Prime Minister 

Manmohan Singh
 as Minister of Water Resources,5 a position he holds currently. Soz was appointed President of the Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh (state) Congress Committee in February 2008.6




 Bibliography 


Soz has written and edited several books including:



 Kashmir Crisis (Soz, Saifuddin (ed). 1993, LC Control No.: 93907156: http://lccn.loc.gov/93907156), 


 Why Autonomy to Kashmir (Soz, Saifuddin (ed). 1995, LC Control No.: 95910487: http://lccn.loc.gov/95910487),

He also translated M. Illin's book 1,00,000 Whys from

, an effort for which he received the 
Soviet Land Nehru Award.3 He has written essays and short stories in Kashmiri, several articles in reputed newspapers and journals on a variety of subjects like Islam and modernism, rights of women, secularism, literature, education and economics. He has participated widely in discussions on Kashmir during the last two decades. He is also the recipient of several literary awards including Soviet Land Nehru Award, All India Basic Literature Competition Award and Competition for Literature for Neo-Literates Award.3

American music history

Curses




The 27 Club, also occasionally known as the Forever 27 Club, is a 
popular culture name for a group of influential 
rock and 
blues musicians who all died at the age of 27, sometimes under mysterious circumstances.123


Musicians usually included in the 27 Club


There is some debate as to the criterion used to include musicians who died at the age of 27 in the  27 Club . The impetus for the Club's creation were the deaths of an unusual number of prominent 27 year old musicians within a two year period of time . Lists include Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison. All four of these musicians died between 1969 and 1971. Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison all died within a ten month period. Morrison and Jones died on the same date two years apart. Kurt Cobain, who died in 1994, was later included by some, probably due to his popularity and his death occurring at the pinnacle of his career. (According to the book 

Heavier Than Heaven
, when Cobain died, his sister claimed that as a kid he would talk about how he wanted to join the 27 Club.)4

Other well-known musicians who died at 27


Some lists include other musicians who died at age 27. Cobain and Hendrix biographer 
Charles R. Cross writes,  The number of musicians who passed away at 27 is truly remarkable by any standard. [Although] humans die regularly at all ages, there is a statistical spike for musicians who die at 27. 3

Legend



Up for eviction



Not in house






Big Brother: The Boss (Big Brother:       ) (also known as Big Brother Arabia) was a 
2004 Arabic-language 
television show, based on the worldwide hit 








Big Brother







, in which contestants live in a specially built house while competing for a prize. The show was aired on 

MBC 2
 with a big prize $100 000, not won because of the cancellation. 


The show was filmed in the 


Amwaj Islands

 in 

Bahrain
. It was hoped that the show would follow the success of such popular programs as 
Star Academy, and the recent dating show  Al Hawa Sawa,  but failed to do so, and instead the show gained major controversy in the countries it aired in.


Many were offended by the fact that it featured six men and six women living together in one area, despite staying in separate parts of the house, and the only way of communicating with each other was in open areas such as the kitchen and garden.


The show began on airing 
21 February, and was discontinued 11 Days later on 
2 March to avoid more controversy in the Arab World. During the first (and only) nominations Asjan, Bashara, Najwa and Shaza were nominated. However, an eviction never took place.

Hijab.

Lebanon

Bahrain
. She, along with Asjan, Bashara, and Najwa was Nominated for Eviction in the first round of Nominations. Shaza is a 
lesbian. 





The House


The house was mainly segregated for the male and female housemates. Single-sex bedrooms, bathrooms and prayer rooms were provided and the only parts of the house accessible to both sexes were the kitchen and garden areas. Parts of the house (e.g. the women's bedroom) were monitored by female camera operators only. Five times a day, Big Brother would announce to the housemates the time for prayer.




Cancellation


Producers decided to cancel the show, as there were many complaints from viewers, and complaints on Arab radio talkshows. The show producers actually went into the house in person to inform the housemates that it was to be cancelled. Many of the Housemates were devastated at the news that they had to leave.

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Business




In 
bookkeeping, 
accounting, and 
finance, Net sales are operating 
revenues earned by a company when it sells its products. Revenue net sales are reported directly on the 
income statement  as Sales or Net sales. 

In financial ratios that use income statement sales values,  sales  refers to net sales, not 
gross sales. 
Sales are the unique transactions that occur in professional 
selling or during 
marketing initiatives.


Revenue is earned when goods are delivered or services are rendered.1 The term sales in a 
marketing, 
advertising or a general business context often refers to a 
contract in which a buyer has agreed to purchase some products at a set time in the future. From an accounting standpoint, sales do not occur until the product is delivered.  Outstanding orders  refers to sales orders that have not been filled.

A sale is a transfer of property for money or credit.2 In 
double-entry bookkeeping, a sale of 
merchandise is recorded in the 
general journal as a 
debit to cash or 
accounts receivable and a 
credit to the sales account.3 The amount recorded is the actual monetary value of the transaction, not the 
list price of the merchandise. A 
discount from list price might be noted if it applies to the sale.


Fees for services are recorded separately from sales of merchandise, but the bookkeeping transactions for recording  sales  of services are similar to those for recording sales of tangible goods.

Gross sales are the sum of all sales during a time period. Net sales are gross sales minus sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. Gross sales do not normally appear on an 
income statement. The sales figures reported on an income statement are net sales.4



 sales returns are refunds to customers for returned merchandise


 sales allowances are reductions in sales price for merchandise with minor defects, the allowance agreed upon after the customer has purchased the merchandise (see also 
credit note)


 sales discounts are reduced payments from the customer based on invoice payment terms such as 2/10, n/30 (2% discount if paid within 10 days, net invoice total due in 30 days)




Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Discounts are 
contra-revenue accounts.

Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
 1975 version of the 
Soyuz spacecraft (
Soyuz 7K-TM) served as a technological bridge to the third generation 
Soyuz-T  (T -             , Transportnyi meaning transport) spacecraft (1976-1986). 


The Soyuz ASTP spacecraft was designed for use during the 
Apollo Soyuz Test Project as 
Soyuz 19. It featured design changes to increase compatibility with the American craft. The Soyuz ASTP featured new solar panels for increased mission length, an androgynous universal docking mechanism instead of the standard male mechanism and modifications to the environmental control system to lower the cabin pressure to 0.68 atmospheres (69 kPa) prior to docking with Apollo. The ASTP Soyuz backup craft flew as the 

Soyuz 22
 mission, replacing the docking port with a camera.

History


WAM was originally formed as the Western Australian Rock Music Industry Association Inc. (WARMIA) in 
1985, with its main aim to develop and run annual awards recognising achievements within the music industry in 




Western Australia



. WAM first received project funding from the state government in 
1989, and in the early 90s the word  rock  was dropped from the title to give the organisation scope to take on a broader constituency. 


In 
1989 the inaugural WA Song Contest commenced, in 
2002 it was rebranded as the WAM Song of the Year.


The WAM Song of the Year is open to all residents of Western Australia. The song must be the original work of the songwriter(s). Songwriters with a publishing deal can only enter the Professional category.

Judith  Judy  Feiner Crichton (
November 25 
1929   
October 14 
2007) was an award-winning documentary producer and a pioneering woman in American television broadcasting. 

A daughter of Ben and Edith Lansburg Feiner, as a teenager she  assisted her father, a television producer, with the first television coverage of a presidential election in 1944. The fledgling network, 
WCBW-TV (a precursor of 






WCBS-TV





), broadcast from Grand Central Terminal by coaxial cable. Crichton's job was to write the names of the states on a blackboard and record electoral college votes as they came in. Crichton continued her television career by working for 

DuMont Television Network
 in the late 1940s. She was a researcher, writer and associate producer of a game show called  What's the Story? , featuring 







Jimmy Cannon






, 







Harriet Van Horne






 and 
Meyer Berger; the show provided clues about unidentified historical events which contestants would have to identify.


Women were not present at network news organizations as writers, directors or producers during the 1950s and 1960s, and Crichton began her producing career as a writer and producer for the Goodson-Todman game show, 
I've Got A Secret, from 1952 through 1968. At the same time, she wrote and produced a radio series for actress and consumer advocate 

Betty Furness
 called Dimensions of a Woman's World. 


Crichton was the principal organizer and producer of New York City's city-wide events in celebration of the first 















Earth Day














 in April 1970. In 1971, Crichton produced (with Chester Feldman) a documentary of the making of the cast album of the Broadway musical Company; the result, Company: The Making of a Cast Album, was one of the first 
cinema verite documentaries broadcast on network television and an early example of the behind-the-scenes genre that would become a television staple.


In 1974, she became the first woman producer for the prestigious documentary unit, 
CBS Reports. She produced and wrote such award-winning documentaries as The CIA's Secret Army, The Battle for South Africa (the first American glimpse into training camps for the 

African National Congress
), The American Way of Cancer, and The Nuclear Battlefield. As a producer, co-director and co-writer of  The Nuclear Battlefield  (1980), Crichton won three Emmy Awards.


Judy Crichton moved to 
ABC News in 1981 where she was a producer, writer and senior producer for ABC Close-up, the network news' documentary unit. She produced Fortress Israel, Oh Tell the World What Happened (about the massacres in the Sabra and Shatilla Palestinian refugee camps); and The Fire Unleashed. For Oh Tell the World What Happened, Crichton won a DuPont-Columbia Award. In 1982, she was the senior producer of Close-up s three-hour biography of 



Franklin D. Roosevelt


, for which she won a 



Christopher Award


. In 1986 she led the first Western television journalism team to report from the People's Republic of Angola since the revolution there in 1975; these reports aired on 

Nightline
 and 
ABC World News Tonight.


Judy Crichton was the founding executive producer of the prize-winning 
PBS historical series, 

American Experience
, from its inception in 1987 until the end of 1996. American Experience was the first network history series. During Crichton's tenure, the series, produced at 
WGBH in 
Boston, won the George Foster Peabody Award (six awards); the Alfred I duPont - Columbia Journalism Award (two awards); the Writers Guild Awards (five awards); the Organization of American Historians (five awards); and the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, Emmy Awards (seven awards). Under her leadership,  American Experience  produced documentaries such as The Donner Party, The Battle Over Citizen Kane,
FDR, LBJ, Malcolm X: Make It Plain, and Coney Island.


Crichton authored America 1900 (published by Holt in 2000), which surveyed the pivotal historical experiences of that year in American history. She was co-writer with David Grubin for his PBS documentary based on the book.


Judy Crichton was one of the women in news profiled in the 2001 
PBS documentary, She Says: Women in News. She recounted that  [T]he first wave of women in journalism were trying to push back those barnacles that had stuck to our brains since childhood that said we were the second sex, that we were inferior creatures, that men knew everything. 


President 



Bill Clinton


 awarded Judy Crichton the 



National Humanities Medal


 in December 2000. On awarding the medal, President Clinton said,  In creating and producing the PBS series  The American Experience,  she set a new standard for what television documentaries can be. With talent, passion and purpose, Judy Crichton has elevated a medium she loves and lifted all those who watch it. 


In 1998, Crichton received the Evelyn F. Burkey Memorial Award from the Writers' Guild of America (East). The Burkey Award is presented annually to  one whose contributions have brought honor and dignity to writers everywhere . She was the fourth woman to receive the Burkey Award.



Personal life


Judy Feiner was married to the novelist 






Robert Crichton





, who died in 1993. They had four children, including a daughter who is now deceased. Judy Crichton died in October 2007 while living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City.

William Hunter (born 
14 February 
1940 in 

Edinburgh
) was a 

Scottish
 
footballer who played most of his career with 


Motherwell

.


Club career


Hunter joined Motherwell from 
Edinburgh Norton in 1957. Although usually played as an inside left, he also played occasionally as a winger, and was compared favourably to 
Gordon Smith for his performance in that role.1 


In May 1967, the 
Detroit Cougars paid  14,000 for his transfer and Hunter moved to the new 








American







 professional league, the 

NASL
.1 His new side survived for only one year however and at the end of the 1968 NASL season, he returned to Scotland to join 

Hibernian
. Hunter was a substitute as his new team lost the 



1968-69


 












Scottish League Cup











 final to 

Celtic
 and played for the Edinburgh team until 1971. 




International career


Hunter earned three 
caps for the 

Scotland national team
 while with Motherwell, all in 1960. He scored his only Scotland goal in his first cap in a 3-3 draw with 

Hungary
. He also played in defeats to 

Turkey
 and 

Wales
. 




Managerial career


After four years playing in 

South Africa
, Hunter returned to 











Britain










 as assistant manager to former Motherwell team-mate 











Ian St. John










, a role he held for three years.1 He earned the opportunity to manage in his own right at 

Queen of the South
 in 1978 but left after only four months. His last involvement in football was as 


Inverness Caledonian's

 manager from 1979 to 1981.

Auckland
New Zealand electorates




Northcote is a 









New Zealand








 Parliamentary 








electorate







, returning one Member of Parliament to the 









New Zealand








 

House of Representatives
. The current MP for Northcote is 

Jonathan Coleman
1. of the 

National Party
. He has held this position since 
2005.

Northcote is based around the suburbs of 






North Shore City





 at the northern end of the 

Auckland Harbour Bridge
. Besides the eponymous 

Northcote
, there is 

Birkenhead
, 

Birkdale
 and the southern end of 
Glenfield. It was created ahead of the change to 
Mixed Member Proportional voting in 
1996 by merging the seat of 
Birkenhead with most of the old 
Glenfield electorate; its boundaries have remained largely unchanged since.


Northcote continues the electoral habits of its predecessor seats; Birkenhead was a reasonably safe seat for the 

National Party
, supplying it with 

Jim McLay
, who lead the party in the mid 1980s, and remains the only National Party leader to never take his party to an election. In 
1987, the seat that would provide National with a leader provided 

Labour
 with a gain, before swinging back into the blue column when Labour's fortunes thinned out at the 
1990 election. Glenfield also followed this boom and bust model, being held by Labour Party MP 

Judy Keall
 through the duration of the fourth Labour government before the National Party landslide in 1990 claimed Keall as one of its victims.


The first MP for Northcote was 

Ian Revell
 from the National Party, who would rise to become the Deputy Speaker. Revell was caught up in a scandal for misuse of offical letterhead and was defeated by Labour's 











Ann Hartley










 in 

New Zealand general election, 1999
. Hartley herself was ousted by the seat's present representative, Jonathan Coleman when National consolidated the centre-right vote in 2005.

Esteban Carlos Munras (1798 1850) was a 19th century artist, probably best known for the vibrantly-colored 
frescoes that adorn the chapel interior at 
Mission San Miguel Arcangel in 

California
. Having studied art in his native city of 
Barcelona, Spain, Munras immigrated to the 








United States







 as a young man, ultimately making his home in the town of 

Monterey
.

At the request of mission priest Father 
Juan Cabot (also a native of Barcelona), Munras traveled to San Miguel, north of 

Paso Robles
, in the early 1820s.  Various religious-themed scenes (known as the  Munras murals ) were painted by the local 



Salinan


 Indians under Munras' direction. His designs reflected the 
Neo-Classical tastes of the period, and the reredos (main altarpiece) reflects knowledge of an artist who had seen the fashionably decorated churches in 








Mexico







 of that era; the interior has remained untouched and has been preserved in its original state. Don Munras was also a dealer in hides and 
tallow, the products of his rancho in Monterey. He built the first home to be constructed outside the walls of the 









El Presidio Real de San Carlos de Monterey








, where he established a thriving trading house attached to the family home. Munras imported fine household furnishings and necessities to the earliest settlers in California's first capital. Munras, the last Spanish diplomat to California, died in 1850 in Monterey.

In American estate planning parlance, an incentive trust is a 


trust

 designed to encourage or discourage certain behaviors by using distributions of trust income or principal as an incentive.  A typical incentive trust might encourage a beneficiary to complete a degree, enter a profession, or abstain from harmful conduct such as substance abuse.  The beneficiary might be paid a certain amount of money from the trust upon graduating from college, or the trust might pay a dollar of income from the trust for every dollar the beneficiary earns.


Although incentive trusts have apparently become more common in the early twenty-first century, a 2007 survey found that less than one-third of wealthy Americans attach conditions to the distribution of their estates.[https://www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/Requester?resource=/wcm/resources/file/ebd25008a977f13/PNC_WV_Inheritance_Rls.pdf] According to Joshua Tate, an assistant professor at 





SMU Dedman School of Law




, incentive trusts pose a problem of inflexibility:   because the settlor cannot foresee all potential eventualities or circumstances and take them into account in the trust, the terms of the trust can prove to be a burden for the beneficiaries. 
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=873625  Eileen Gallo, a noted psychotherapist, has argued that, although incentive trusts may be effective in changing behavior, they may in fact be damaging to the beneficiaries, in that they rely on external motivation to encourage activities that should be 
autotelic in nature.
http://www.fpanet.org/journal/articles/2004_Issues/jfp1204-art3.cfm  The seeming popularity of incentive trusts, however, is reflected in the many websites created by estate planners to market them.

Design history


The beginning of the American high-performance, deep-vee boat building industry is said to have started in 1958, with the first deep-vee 
hull, designed by Ray Hunt. 


The Hunt design had a 24 degree deadrise, which eliminated much of the pounding of the conventional hulls. An added feature of the Hunt design, were longitudinal strakes on the bottom to give added lift and throw out the spray to keep the boat dry.  This 24 degree deep vee hull is the foundation of the Magnum design.


Naval architect, Jim Wynne, was impressed with the characteristics and performance of Hunt s boat and designed a similar deep-vee hull, which was equally successful. 


In 1962, 
Don Aronow, a retired real estate developer, asked Jim Wynne and Walt Walters to design a high performance Deep-Vee hull for him to race. This was the first of the famed, Aronow hulls, which he promoted first under the name Formula, then Donzi, then Magnum (1966   1968), then Cigarette boats.




Company history


Don Aronow built the Magnum 27  and Magnum 35   then sold Magnum Marine, only two years later, to Apeco in 1968 who, continued Aronow s racing tradition and developed the Magnum 28 ,25  and 38 , now called the Classics.


Magnum Marine in Miami, Florida, was founded in 1966, when Don Aronow built two hulls specifically for the 
offshore powerboat racing circuit. These two designs, with which he launched Magnum Marine, were the Magnum 27  and the Magnum 35 ; both went on to become World Offshore Champions in Open Class racing. To these two models, he added a 16  ski boat, the Marauder and a 16  Catamaran, the Missile. Aronow sold Magnum Marine to Apeco in 1968. Apeco soon dropped the Missile and Marauder boats and launched the Magnum 25 , 28  and 38 . All the above models are now called the Magnum Classics.


In 1976 Magnum Marine was sold to Marchese Filippo Theodoli, an Italian boat builder, and his wife Katrin. This brought a major change in the product line. Filippo Theodoli had the innovative idea of applying high-performance technology to larger, luxury 
yachts. And thus, the first high-performance yachts were born. These craft would reach the speeds of the race boats, but would have the comforts of the traditional yacht. 


Filippo died in 1990 and his wife Katrin continues his legacy. She is the only woman 
CEO of a high-performance boat company. With her new designs and continuously improved technology, Katrin has brought Magnum Marine s success to the Patrol Craft and Pleasure boat market. 


Giovanni Theodoli s addition to Magnum (Katrin and Filippo s only son) has has sought to resurrect some of company s classics, such as the magnum 27 , which has been re-designed and re-released some 40 years after the original was first released.

 PHP scripting 



PHP4Delphi allows executing the 







PHP






 scripts within the Delphi program using TpsvPHP component directly without a 
Web server. It is a scripting for applications (like 

VBA
 for 

Microsoft Office
) that enable you to write client-side 
GUI applications or server-side PHP support in case if you are developing PHP enabled 
web servers. One of the goals behind it was to prove that PHP is a capable general-purpose scripting language that is suited for more than just Web applications. With PHP4Delphi you can use Delphi forms instead of web-forms, pass parameters to script directly.

1944 births




Massimo Vitali was born in Como, Italy in 1944. Vitali studied photography in London; he first worked as a photojournalist in the 1970s and then worked later as a movie camera operator. His more recent work can be considered as fine-art photography. 

Vitali's chosen perspective for some of his works is from a podium (four or five meters high), with the use of large-format film cameras which are used to capture high-resolution details over a broad expanse in everyday scenes such as 
beaches.

Famous rhinoceroses







Abada depicted by Philippe Galle in 1586


 
Abada (alternatively Bada or Ibada) was the name given to a female 
Indian rhinoceros kept by 


Philip II of Spain

 from about 1579 to 1588. It was the first rhinoceros seen in Europe since the specimen that had been sent as a present from the King of Portugal, 

Manuel I
, to 
Pope Leo X in 1515, which had died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516, but been immortalised as 
Durer's Rhinoceros.

Abada was probably meant as a general term for the rhinoceros, as it derives from the 

Malay
 word (badak) for the animal and may have been in use in 



Spain


 and 

Portugal
 from around 1530, but since this was the only example of the species in Europe it served as a proper name as well.


In 1577, the 
rhinoceros arrived at the port of 














Lisbon













 intended for the menagerie of 

Sebastien I of Portugal
, probably as a gift from the 
viceroys of 

India
. As a safety measure the horn was removed (this later grew back, but seems to have been removed on a regular basis). 


Sebastien was succeeded by 

Henry I
 the following year. On the death of Henry in 1580, 


Philip II of Spain

 claimed the throne, reuniting the Spanish and Portuguese crowns, and inherited the rhinoceros which he transferred to the menagerie of 





Casa de Campo




, close to 

Madrid
. On 
16 October 
1583 Philip transferred Abada once again, this time to the menagerie of 














El Escorial













. The transfer did not take place without incident: one of the keepers decided to refresh the animal by dousing it with buckets of water, but the sudden soaking startled her and, in panic, she knocked down all her attendants. At El Escorial, Abada was put on display to the public and presented to the Japanese ambassadors in November 1584. 
Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza mentions it in his book, China, in which he comments that the public were impressed by its thick hide and horn, and that there was speculation as to it being the 
unicorn of legend. 


Philip used her to play a joke on the 






Hieronymite





 friars at El Escorial. In the autumn of 1584, he arranged first for an 
Indian elephant (which he had also inherited from the Portuguese menagerie) to be driven up the steps and into the cells of the friars and the following week repeated the trick with the rhinoceros. While the elephant did not baulk at the strange events, Abada was stubborn and complaining, grunted bad-temperedly and refused to eat the food presented to her. At some point in her captivity she may have been blinded because the attendants had difficulty managing her and it was thought that this would make her less likely to attack them.


Abada appears to have died by 1588: 
Juan de Arphe y Villafane included a description and print of a rhinoceros in his manual of decoration published in 1585, based on observations of Abada, rather than 
Durer's picture, as it lacks the dorsal horn added by Durer;  she was still alive in 1586 when her image was captured in an engraving by 
Philippe Galle, and was seen by 
Pedro Paez the following year, but there is no record of her after 1587. A street in Madrid, Calle de la Abada, close to the 





Puerta del Sol




 still bears her name.

Eren Derdiyok (born 
June 12, 
1988 in 

Basel
) is a 
Swiss football player of 
Turkish origin who currently plays as 
striker in the 

Swiss Super League
 for 


FC Basel

. 



Club career


At 6' 2  Derdiyok is a powerful striker who can also fill in a centre-back if needed. He started his career with Swiss minnows 
BSC Old Boys at the beginning of the 2005/06 season in which scored 10 goals in just 18 appearances. 


FC Basel

 noticed his goal scoring instinct and snapped him up in 2006 at the age of 18. In the 2006/07 season, Derdiyok was used mainly as a substitute, playing only one full game, and averaging a total of 220 play minutes that season. For Derdiyok, the 2007/08 season proved to be a lot more profitable and he received regular playing time. In FC Basel's main squad, Derdiyok scored his first hat trick playing away against 


FC Thun

 on 
2 March, 
2008.
On 
6 April, 
2008 he won the 
Swisscom Cup, his first title.
On 
29 June, 
2008 it was reported by the English media that he is in talks with 
Newcastle United representatives.1 It is hoped that a transfer will be completed before the transfer window shuts at the end of August. On 
August 27 
2008, he scored the winning goal in FC Basel's 2-1 win over 
Vitoria S.C. at 

St. Jakob-Park
 which meant that Basel qualified for the 




UEFA Champions League



.




International career


Derdiyok made his international debut for 

Switzerland
 on 
6 February 
2008, as a second-half substitute against 

England
 at 

Wembley Stadium
 in 

London
. He scored with his first touch of the ball to equalise, but they eventually lost 2-1. He was named as part of the Switzerland squad to play at 

UEFA Euro 2008
 and was the youngest player at the tournament at 19 years old. He assisted in the build-up to all of his team's goals at the tournament.

Parco della Resistenza in Forli




The Parco della Resistenza ('Resistance Park') is a city park in 
Forli.


It was engineerd by L. Mirri in 1816 on a typical illuministic framework and renovated twice during the following century. The park was built after the fashion of typical Italian gardens although at that stage the English landscape gardens were becoming very popular too.


During those days, the center of the garden was occupied by an obelisc surrounded by symmetrical flower beds. Four more smaller centralities were dislocated peripherically around four statues representing the four seasons. At the garden bottom there stood a small temple, the 
Kafeehaus and the keeper's house.


In 1928 the garden was completely renovated by the engineer G. Santarelli. To obtain a better dreinage the soil level was raised and pedestrians walks were separated from coaches tracks. The three bottom buildings were replaced by one single service building. During the 
seventies, further works were undertaken and the garden was widened up to 
Viale Spazzoli.


Today the park has two entrances, one in Viale Spazzoli and a second entrance in 
Piazzale della Vittoria. At the entrance in Piazzale della Vittoria the municipality of Forli is offering since 2002 a free bike-hiring service.

The ROKS-2 and ROKS-3 were man-portable 
flamethrowers used by the 
USSR in the 
Second World War. The ROKS-2 was designed not to draw attention so the fuel tank was square and resembled a regular backpack, and the nozzle looked like a service rifle. The 
propellant tank was a small bottle underneath the backpack fuel tank. ROKS-3 was a simplified design and had a regular cylindrical fuel tank. The Finnish designation for captured ROKS-2 units was m/41-r.

Roks-2 were used, amongst other engagements, during the close-range fighting during the first days of the battle of 
Kursk in 1943.1

Solar thermal control systems








ambox-move  style=  









 It has been suggested that  be  into this article or section. ()




In the context of 
solar hot water systems, a Solar controller is a device which ensures that the system works correctly. Here is a summary of what a solar controller comprises, what it does and how some controllers can perform other functions as well.


Components


The simplest solar controller is a comparator with two temperature inputs and an output to control the pump. When the temperature of the solar panel's output is greater than the cold input to the consumer (heating system or 
thermal store) the pump is switched on to circulate the working fluid through the panel. Electronically this can be, and frequently has been, done with little more than a 741 
op-amp IC and a relay. With only a handful more components, some 
hysteresis may be added to avoid short-cycling the pump (this would be wasteful, as it increases heat losses into cold pipework and may also be wasteful in a 
drainback solar panel).


A more typical approach for modern systems is to use the ubiquitous 
microprocessor. In a commercial product this is also likely to offer a simple LCD display and a minimal user interface of a few pushbuttons. The same two inputs have temperature sensors: one for the hottest part of the 
solar panel and the other for the coolest part of the water store, which is at the bottom. The other two connections are power in and switched power out to the pump. The power can come in from a mains electric supply, in the case of low carbon solar technology. In the event of the latest innovation, a zero carbon controller, power is sourced wholly from a 
photovoltaic (PV) module which also acts as a power supply.


Other components beyond the basics mentioned above include extra temperature sensors for higher up on the water store, because it gets hotter the higher you go up it, and an 
LCD or other display. This display can tell the user things such as whether the pump is switched on, what temperature the water at the top of the store is at. This is the temperature of the water which will come out of the taps and therefore it is a useful temperature to know about.




Function


Its main function is to control when the solar panel's pump is switched on or off.  The pump is usually switched off when the solar panel is colder than the bottom of the water store and it is switched on when the panel is hotter. Switching the pump on allows the heat in the panel to be transferred to the store. Switching it off prevents the export of bought-in energy. Every few seconds, the temperatures in the panel and the store are measured and compared in order to allow this on or off decision to happen.


In addition, certain fine tuning can take place, such as allowing an overrun time to ensure that heat energy is not left lying about underlivered in interconnecting pipes when the pump is turned from on to off. Another fine tuning is that of the on differential (which may be say 4-15 degrees 


Celsius

) and the off differential which is usually a few degrees lower. The wider the difference between these differentials, the fewer pump on-off cycles will take place. These factors are usually set by the solar installer in relation to the particular installation. The controller may also control certain safety features such as by permitting heat export when the hot water exceed a preset temperature such as 65oC. This is a process of allowing the solar panel to export excess heat if it is not being used when the panel is cool, when light levels fall towards the end of a sunny day and is used in a range of solar thermal technnologies such as solartwin.

The Mindanao Bleeding-heart (Gallicolumba crinigera) is a species of 
bird in the 
pigeon and dove 
family (
Columbidae). It is 
endemic to the 

Philippines
. It is so named because of a red blotch on its breast.


Its natural 
habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland 
forests. It is threatened by 
habitat loss and overhunting. Formerly occurring on 
Samar, 
Leyte, 
Bohol, 

Dinagat
, 
Mindanao and 
Basilan, it is only found on Mindanao today. The Basilan 
subspecies, Gallicolumba crinigera bartletti, apparently became 
extinct by the mid-20th century.


However, the subspecies Gallicolumba crinigera crinigera seems more common than previously believed; nonetheless, its status is not sufficiently known for a definite assessment. Initially listed as a species of Least Concern in 1988, it was subsequently uplisted to Vulnerable in 1994, and further to Endangered in 2000. With its exact rate of decline still unresolved, it is downlisted again to Vulnerable status in the 2007 
IUCN Red List.1

. It is one of the island's better public beaches, but access to it from the land is difficult, as it lies beyond 
Anderson Air Force Base, and non-military personnel require a pass to travel through the base so as to reach it. Access is easier via boat.

In perhaps the earliest and best sourced biography of 





George Washington




 by perhaps the new nations premier writer,  



Washington Irving


 it gives details to the effect that in 1751 or shortly after when he was but 19 years old and appointed a militia leader for his district with the nominal rank of Major 





George Washington




 set about schooling himself for his military duties under the tutelage of his elder half brother 
Lawrence Washington, a veteran of campaigns under the British flag..and his old brothers old cronies, an Adjutant named  Muse  (no first name given) who taught him the 'evolution of arms'  and  sword master named Jacob Van Braam.. styled as being a Mercenary  of the Dalgetty Order 






 

 He now set about preparing himself, with his usual method and assiduity, for his new duties. 

Virginia
 had among its floating population some military relics of the late Spanish war. Among these was a certain Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had served with Lawrence Washington in the campaigns in the 
West Indies, and had been with him in the attack on 
Carthagena. He now undertook to instruct his brother George in the art of war; lent him treatises on military tactics; put him through the manual exercise, and gave him some idea of evolutions in the field. Another of Lawrence's campaigning comrades was Jacob Van Braam, a Dutchman by birth; a soldier of fortune of the Dalgetty order; who had been in the 
British army, but was now out of service, and, professing to be a complete master of fence, recruited his slender purse in this time of military excitement, by giving the Virginian youth lessons in the sword exercise.Under the instructions of these veterans Mount Vernon, from being a quiet rural retreat, where Washington, three years previously, had indited love ditties to his  lowland beauty,  was suddenly transformed into a school of arms, as he practised the manual exercise with Adjutant Muse, or took lessons on the broadsword from Van Braam.''

 





Curiously other biographers (notably, 

John Marshall
) mention him only as 'an interpreter' brought along on the preliminary diplomatic expeditions leading up to the culmination of his earlier actions against the French, and not as a long time associate and instructor who campaigned with his brother and schooled George Washington in the art of the sword and other military matters. At the 
Battle of Great Meadows in July of 1754, 






 

 The fort was handed over on July 4 and the bulk of British garrison were allowed to return to Maryland honorably. Two British prisoners, 

Robert Stobo
and Jacob Van Braam, were retained by the French as a guarantee of compliance with the terms of surrender. The French burned the fort and returned to Fort Duquesne.''

 





The order of Dalgetty appears to be completely unknown although it is a place name in Scotland. Curiously enough, a character in Sir Walter Scot's fictional work  





Legends of Montrose




  set in Scotland of the 17th century and published in 1819 is a Mercenary named Dalgetty. 






 

Much of the novel is taken up with a subplot involving an expedition into enemy territory by Dugald Dalgetty, an experienced mercenary fighting for Montrose. Dalgetty does not fight out of political or religious conviction, but purely for the love of carnage. However, he is very professional, and remains loyal to an employer to the end of his contract. He gained his experience fighting for various armies during the Thirty Years' War, then still raging in Germany. Note: He did not fight all thirty years. Dalgetty is regarded as one of Scott's finest comic characters, however he dominates so much of the story that the main plot is not really developed in detail.''

King Cotton is a specially commissioned musical written by 





Jimmy McGovern




 and directed by 












Jude Kelly











, with original music by 














Howard Goodall













. The production is based on an idea by 
Ian Brownbill and designed by 
Ti Green. 

The piece has been co-commissioned by 

The Lowry
 and the 
Liverpool Culture Company to mark 'Liverpool 08' and the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade. The project is supported by 






Arts Council England





, the 
PRS Foundation and the 

Liverpool Empire Theatre
.


The production is set in the Lancashire cotton famine and links with the American Civil War. King Cotton is the epic story of Tom, an impoverished mill-worker from the North West of England and Sokoto, a black slave from an American cotton plantation. Both are searching for their own freedom, but neither imagines that this journey will bring them together with such devastating consequences. The play is set to a moving live score of brass band music, provided by 
Ashton Under Lyne Brass Band and traditional spiritual music.


The play is set to star 

John Henshaw
, 
Israel Oyelumade and 
Paul Anderson and will debut at The Lowry, Salford, UK on the 12th September 2007, before moving to the Liverpool Empire Theatre from the 25th September 2007.[]

Living people
North Korean people imprisoned abroad




Woo Yong Gak (1929? - ) is a 

North Korea
n former 
commando known to have been the longest-serving 
political prisoner in the world at the time of his release from incarceration in 

South Korea
 on 25 February 1999.1

He served 40 years, 7 months and 13 days in 
prison.2 It has also been said that he  spent 41 years in 
solitary confinement .34 He was returned to his country of origin in September 2000. 



 Capture 


He was captured during a North Korean commando raid in South Korean waters in 1958 in which he participated as one of the raiders.5




 Imprisonment 



 Purpose 


Upon being convicted of the crime of conducting 
espionage for North Korea, he was sentenced to 
life imprisonment.6 South Korea claimed that he had been leading a group of spies.7 Throughout his imprisonment he refused to sign an 
oath of obedience to 

South Korea's National Security Law
, which bans the display or expression of any pro-North Korean sentiment.8




 Torture allegation 


A report by 
Amnesty International records his claim to have been 
tortured in an underground facility after his 
arrest and forced to make a 
confession.9




 Solitary confinement 



South Korean law specifies solitary confinement for spies, even if they pose no physical threat.10 
He was held in solitary confinement in a 12-by-12 foot cell since his capture aboard a North Korean boat off South Korea's east coast.11 The terms of his imprisonment permitted him half an hour of daily exercise with other prisoners. 12 In 1998 he was said to be  missing all his teeth because of years of torture, poor food, and inadequate medical treatment .13
In 1999, still prior to his release, he was reported to be suffering from a degree of muscular 
paralysis resulting from a 
stroke14





 Release and repatriation 


He was among 17 long-term political detainees released under a wider 
amnesty to mark 
President Kim Dae-jung's first year in office.15 As a 70 year old man, he walked free from the gates of 

Daejeon
 prison.16 It was proposed that he may be allowed to return to North Korea, where he had a wife and son,17 in exchange for South Korean 
prisoners of war.18 He was returned there, though not in exchange for any imprisoned South Koreans, in early September 2000.1920

Auttapon Prakopkong                  (who is better known as M The star) is a 

Thai
 singer who was the champion of the popular reality TV program named  The star 2  when he was 25 years old. 


Biography


He was born 
September 28, 
1978 in 

Chiang Mai
 (Northern Thailand). Although his parents were divorced when he was only 2 years old, his strong determination to be a good person was always kept in his mind. This might be caused by his mother s advice as a teacher. As a teenager, he had a part-time job as a singer at the Public House in Chiang Mai. It led him to his goal of being a professional singer. 


The first challenge came when he applied to join  The Star 1  together with his friends; Jeiw-Piyanuth and New-Napassorn. Both of the girls went to the final round but he was knocked out in the first round. Again, his strong determination to be a singer still never continued on as he later joined  The Star 2  in the next year and was the winner by getting 50.81% of the audience s vote in the final round. He finally achieved one of his dreams to be the winner of the star. Later, he had a chance to release the debut album with the huge entertainment company in Thailand, GMM Grammy.


He decided to drop out of his first year at 




Payap University



 to focus on his singing career. In the future he would like to have further education in the music field aboard.

Willy DeVille\Mink DeVille





Coup de Grace, issued in 1981, is the fourth 
album by the 
rock band 

Mink DeVille
. The album represented a departure for the band, as frontman 

Willy DeVille
 dimissed the only other remaining original member of the band, guitarist 







Louis X. Erlanger






, and hired 











Helen Schneider










's backup band ( The Kick ) to record the album.1 Moreover, the album was recorded for 

Atlantic
 (Mink DeVille had previously recorded with 

Capitol
).


DeVille told the New York Times:


I had band problems, manager problems, record company problems,    And yeah, I had drug problems. Finally I got a new recording contract, with Atlantic, and a new manager. I cleaned up my act. I figured that since playing music with people I was friends with didn't seem to work out, I would hire some mercenaries, some cats who just wanted to play and get paid. And those guys turned out to be more devoted to the music than any band I ever had. They're professional, precise, but they're full of fire, too. 2







Jack Nitzsche



 produced the album, his third for Mink DeVille, along with Willy DeVille (the song  Love Me Like You Did Before  was produced by Willy DeVille and 











Thom Panunzio










).



Reviews


Dutch rock magazine OOR named Coup de Grace the fifth best album of 1981.3 

Allmusic
 said about Coup de Grace:




The band's sound combined with Nitzsche's timeless production style, which combined with that voice to create a purer rock   roll noise than even 



Bruce Springsteen


's in 1981. The evidence is on the anthems  Maybe Tomorrow,  the slippery 
doo-wop feel of  Love and Emotion,  and the devastating read of 




Arthur Alexander



's  You Better Move On  that includes in its soulful Spanish stroll mix a pair of 
marimbas and the ever-lamenting 
accordion, turning the track into something that is so deadly serious it should have perhaps been in 

West Side Story
. This was Mink DeVille near their zenith as a recording unit.4

Platystacus cotylephorus the only 
species of 
catfish (
order Siluriformes) in the 
genus Platystacus of the 
family 
Aspredinidae.1 The genus Platystacus is the 
sister group to a 
clade containing 
Aspredo and 
Aspredinichthys.2 P. cotylephorus originates from coastal waters and lower portions of rivers of northern 



South America


, from 

Venezuela
 to northern 

Brazil
.1


This species grows up to about 32.0 
centimetres (12.6 
in) 
SL and is distinguished from all other aspredinids by having 4+5 caudal fin rays. They are further distinguished from its close relatives by the absence of accessory 
maxillary barbels and the presence of well developed rows of unculiferous 
tubercles.2


P. cotylephorus occurs mainly in 
brackish water and is found on soft bottoms of shallow turbid water near river mouths. It is reported to migrate from estuaries into 
freshwater, but actual 
spawning apparently takes place in brackish water.3 The species has a peculiar mode of egg incubation wherein the female catfish carries the eggs firmly attached to the underside of the body. This seems to be an adaptation to facilitate the oxygenation of the eggs in muddy environments. Reproduction probably occurs during the earlier part of the year.3

Metal hydrides




Complex metal hydrides are salts wherein the anions contain 
hydrides.  In the older chemical literature as well as contemporary 
materials science textbooks, a  metal hydride  is assumed to be nonmolecular, i.e. three-dimensional lattices of atomic ions.  In such systems, hydrides are often interstitial and 
nonstoichiometric, and the bonding between the metal and hydrogen atoms is significantly 
ionic.  In contrast, complex metal hydrides typically contain more than one type of metal or metalloid and are either soluble or react with water.  They exhibit ionic bonding between a positive metal ion with molecular 
anions containing the hydride.  In such materials the hydrogen is bonded with significant 
covalent character to the second metal or metaloid atoms.1


Examples


In general, complex metal hydrides have the formula MxM'yHn, where M is an alkali metal cation or cation complex and M' is a metal or metalloid.  Well known examples feature 
group 13 elements, especially boron and aluminium including sodium aluminium hydride, NaAlH4 (also known as sodium alanate), and 
lithium borohydride, (LiBH4).  Complex metal hydrides are often soluble in 
etherial 
solvents.  Other complex metal hydrides are numerous.  Illustrative examples include the salts [MgBr([[THF]])2]4FeH6 and 

K2ReH9
.1




 Applications 


Complex metal hydrides of boron and aluminium are widely used in organic synthesis for the reduction of carbon-oxygen and carbon-nitrogen multiple bonds.1  These materials are also of topical interest because of their potential as 
hydrogen storage materials.2  A material such as lithium borohydride is capable of storing hydrogen with greater hydrogen density than liquefied 
methane (and well above the density of 
liquid hydrogen).3  Complex metal hydrides often suffer from instability toward water.

The Georgians were the solo band 

Nat Gonella
 founded on his departure from 
Lew Stone and his Orchestra in 1934. He had already experimented as a solo artist in small groups and with the American pianist 


Garland Wilson

 but this was the first band to carry Nat's name. 

The band featured his brother Bruts on second trumpet, the South African Pat Smuts on Tenor Saxophone, Albert Torrance on Alto Sax, Harold  Baby  Hood on Piano, Charlie Winters on string bass and Nat's former employer Bob Dryden on drums. 


They recorded extensively for the 

Parlophone
 Label throughout the 1930's scoring hits with  Nagasaki ,  I Can't Dance I've Got Ants In My Pants ,  How'm I Doing?   The Shiek of Araby ,  Oh Monah! ,  Ol' Man Mose  and Nat's signature tune  
Georgia On My Mind . In these recording Nat brought jazz, and particularly the jazz stylings of his hero Louis Armstrong, to National prominence through radio broadcasts and tours of the variety circuit. The Georgians were finally disbanded when Nat was called into Service during World War II. 


In the 1940's Nat formed his New Georgians who featured an extended big-band but this group lacked the swing of the smaller 1930's band. 


The Georgians is also the name of an unrelated 1920's British group who played at the Savoy Hotel in London and featured the American trumpeter Frank Guarante.

Spin-off characters



The following is a list of minor characters that first appeared in the 

BBC
 
soap opera 

EastEnders
 in 







1994






, by order of first appearance.
__TOC__


Carmen



Carmen was introduced in February 1994, employed by 

Richard Cole
 to work on 


Sanjay Kapoor

's clothing stall on Bridge Street market. Carmen began to pester Richard to give her the licence for the pitch on a permanent basis. However, later that month Sanjay returned, having failed to trace the whereabouts of his estranged wife, 


Gita

. 


Following this, Carmen began selling heart-patterned boxer-shorts on the market and a pair was sent anonymously to Richard Cole. Richard assumed they were from a secret admirer, until he saw Carmen selling them the following day. She told him that they weren't a popular line and that she'd only had one buyer, Sanjay Kapoor. Sanjay had bought them to prank Richard, but as 


Bianca Jackson

 and 


Natalie Price

 had spent the last few weeks winding him up in a similar way, he did not find the prank amusing. 





Dougie Briggs



Dougie Briggs appeared for several weeks over the spring of 1994, and was actively involved in the storyline that marked the introduction of EastEnders' third weekly episode, The Queen Vic Siege. 


Dougie had been a paratrooper alongside 








Grant Mitchell







 in the 

Falklands War
, and met up with him again more than 10 years later, by which time Grant was the landlord of 
The Queen Vic. Grant allowed Dougie to stay at The Vic, despite his wife 







Sharon's






 objections. Sharon began to feel uncomfortable around Dougie after noticing him leering at her on several occasions, but Grant refused to ask him to leave.


Dougie persuaded Grant to help him out with a raid on a supermarket, promising him a vast financial return, but Grant started to have second thoughts when he found Dougie's sawn-off shotgun. After doing some investigating, Grant discovered that Dougie had been discharged from the paratroopers because psychological tests had revealed that he was 
psychopathic. Dougie tried to stop the Medical Officer from filing the results, and when he refused Dougie shot him in the head and then raped his wife. Realising that he had left Sharon alone in the Vic with a convicted murderer and rapist, Grant fled home and arrived just as Dougie was attempting to sexually assault Sharon. A fight ensued and Grant was knocked unconscious, after which Dougie held Grant, Sharon and barmaid 


Michelle Fowler

 hostage with his shotgun, and demanded money.


The gun went off when Grant tried to claim it and Michelle got in the way of a stray bullet and ended up in a pool of blood on the Vic's floor. Grant overpowered Dougie, and beat him unconscious, but he was forced to leave him in the Vic while he took Michelle to hospital. He contacted his brother 








Phil







 to get rid of Dougie's body and gun, but by the time Phil arrived at the Vic, Dougie had escaped. Grant was convinved that Dougie would return for revenge, however he was apprehended by the police before he could get to the Vic.





Elizabeth Willmott-Brown



Elizabeth Willmott-Brown (nee Bassett) was the wife of rapist, 











James Willmott-Brown










. One of James' victims, 


Kathy Beale

, began to have a recurring nightmare about her rape in 1994. Her boyfriend, 








Phil Mitchell







, decided to go in search of James to scare him away. He traced him to Elizabeth's home, but she told him that James was not in and she was unsure when he would be back. Phil wouldn't give up however, and when Elizabeth left her house many hours later, he demanded that she tell him where James was because he had raped his girlfriend. Elizabeth then got angry and told Phil she was well aware that James was a rapist, but she was trying to protect her two children from it. She also revealed that James had been imprisoned for the rape of another woman. James Willmott-Brown refers to her as  Anne  over the telephone in the episode involving Kathy's rape.





Jacques Butcher



Jacques Butcher was born in 

France
1 to 







Diane Butcher






 and an unknown man. Diane left Jacques with her brother 






Ricky





 and his pregnant wife 


Bianca

 when she followed her boyfriend's band on their tour. Jacques' bad behaviour made Bianca doubt that she wanted children, and she almost had an 
abortion2 Jacques later went to live with Diane's sister 


Clare

 in 

Manchester
, but then moved back in with his mother. 
Diane claimed that he refused to attend the funeral of his grandfather, Frank in April 2008.





Reg Simpson



Reg Simpson owned the 
Bed and Breakfast in Eastbourne where 








Pauline







 and 







Arthur Fowler






 and Nellie Ellis stayed in November 1994. When Reg noticed Arthur's contempt for Nellie, he sympathised with him about interfering in-laws. On the day of their departure, Nellie went missing, and Reg informed Arthur that he had seen her heading for the beach in a sombre mood. The Fowlers feared for her safety, but she was only having paddle in the ocean.





Louise Ellis



Louise Ellis was the daughter of 


Nellie Ellis

's philandering husband, George, who had left Nellie for Louise's mother, Doreen. Louise and her family lived in 

Eastbourne
 and Nellie traveled there for George's funeral in November 1994.


Louise was particularly hostile to Nellie, telling her that she was not welcome at the funeral and that Doreen had only invited her to be polite. She believed that Nellie had made her father's life a misery, and dismissed her mother's guilt over the matter.





Doreen Ellis



Doreen Ellis (legally Burtle) was a former acquaintance of 


Nellie Ellis

 the woman who Nellie's husband, George, had left her for. Doreen contacted Nellie in November 1994 to inform her that George had died and to invite her to his funeral in 

Eastbourne
, where they had lived for many years. Nellie referred to Doreen as  the biggest tart in the East End  and she decided to go to the funeral just to embarrass Doreen.


Nellie was most annoyed to discover that George and Doreen had an upmarket house and a daughter, because George had always refused to have children with her. After the funeral, Doreen approached Nellie and invited her back to her house for the wake. They reminisced about George, but Nellie's bad memories of him weren't shared by Doreen, and it turned out that they had a happy and fulfilling life together. Doreen gave Nellie George's old wedding ring from when they married, having found it in his sock drawer. Nellie was momentarily touched to discover that George had kept it after all these years.


Doreen felt extremely guilty about taking Nellie's husband away from her. Before Nellie returned to Walford, Doreen met her at her hotel to apologise for all the hurt she'd caused. Despite hating Doreen for many years, Nellie realised that she actually liked and admired her. Doreen offered Nellie a photo of George, which was refused. Doreen then told her that she didn't mind if Nellie contested George's will, as she was still legally his wife and she was only ever a mistress   even though Doreen went by the name Ellis she and George had never married. Nellie promised that she wouldn't.





Stanley Bridge



Stanley Bridge attended the funeral and wake of 


Nellie Ellis

's former husband, George, in November 1994. Stanley was a wheelchair-bound amputee, having lost both of his legs. 


Stanley revealed to 







Arthur Fowler






 that he and George had been best friends. When he discovered that Nellie was living with Arthur, Stanley offered his commiserations, saying he'd rather have no legs than put up with her. Stanley revealed that he had been the best man at George and Nellie's wedding, and that he had warned George that Nellie would make his life a misery on his stag night. He was full of praise for George's mistress and long-term partner, Doreen. Nellie overheard everything and found his comments hard to take.





Maxine Palmer



Maxine Palmer was the mother of 


Debbie Tyler

, who appeared during Debbie and 


Nigel

's courtship. She got on well with Nigel, and he liked her. She returned in 1996 after Debbie's death, to help Nigel look after Debbie's daughter 






Clare





 and to support him in his custody battle against Clare's biological father, 


Liam Tyler

.

'WXER is a 
Top 40 
FM 
radio station broadcasting on 104.5 MHz in 

Sheboygan County, Wisconsin
, which is owned by Midwest Communications. The station is licensed to the city of 

Plymouth
 and broadcasts from a tower southwest of the city.



 History 





Studios



WXER originally broadcast from studios with then co-owned 

WPLY
 (1420, now WJUB) on 

Highway 57
 east of the city, but in 1994 after WPLY was sold off, moved them to Falls Plaza, a small shopping center off Fond du Lac Avenue in 

Sheboygan Falls
, which were shared by former sister station 

WCNZ/WCLB
 (950 AM). Finally, the station moved to the Washington Avenue facilities of Midwest's other stations in 

Sheboygan
 when bought by the group in 2005.


The station also has a translator station with the calls W241AG broadcasting at 96.1 FM from the tower site behind the Midwest studios in Sheboygan, which was launched in June 2006 due to ongoing interference problems with WBFM and WHBZ within the city on the 104.5 frequency.


The station launched in 1990 with an easy listening format, then slowly over the years went more towards a more 
adult contemporary format. In 1999, the transition was complete, and the station took on The Point branding, then a popular brand for radio stations using that format. After then-soft rock WWJR became a hard rock station in 2000 under the calls 

WHBZ
, the station became the market's sole AC station until 2003, when 
Cleveland-based WKTT switched from country to 
AC as 

WLKN
. At this time, the station was owned by Mountain Dog Media. The station carried syndicated programming on the weekends, including radio-optimized programming from the 

VH1 Radio Network
, 

Nina Blackwood
's Absolutely 80's, and The Retro Pop Reunion.


In 2005, Mountain Dog sold the station to Midwest while keeping 

ESPN Radio
 affiliate WCLB, which is restricted by a non-compete agreement until 2010 
http://www.northpine.com/broadcast/archive/news0905.html. Shortly after, Midwest ended syndicated programming on the station (except for a Sunday airing of 




American Top 40



), and replaced the station's airstaff with new personalities, including 
voice tracked personalities from other Midwest stations in Green Bay and Wausau. In September 2008, the station took a 
contemporary hit radio/Top 40 format, adding current hip-hop/R B songs to their playlist and narrowing it down to music after 2001, with a few pre-2001 tracks sprinkled in through the playlist.

Internet censorship by country





Internet censorship is effected in Thailand by two methods. The 
Royal Thai Police blocks approximately 32 500 websites and the 


Communications Authority of Thailand

 a further unspecified number directly at Thailand's Internet gateway.



 Informal requests 


The 
Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (
MICT)1 , blocks indirectly by informally  requesting  the blocking of websites by Thailand's 54 commercial and non-profit 
Internet Service Providers (
ISPs).  Although 
ISPs are not legally required to accede to these  requests , 
MICT Permanent Secretary 
Kraisorn Pornsuthee has written in 2006 that 
ISPs who fail to comply will be punitively sanctioned by government in the form of bandwidth restriction or even loss of operating license. This is a powerful compulsion to comply.




 Coups 


On 
September 19 
2006, the Thai military staged a bloodless coup d'etat against the government of elected Prime Minister 


Thaksin Shinawatra

.  The fifth official order signed by coup leader General 


Sonthi Boonyaratglin

 on September 20, the first day following the coup, was to enforce Web censorship and appointing Dr. 
Sitthichai Pokaiudom  The Official Censor of the Military Coup  as Minister of ICT.




 History 


Prior to the military coup d'etat, in September 2006, 34,411 
Internet 
web sites were blocked. The top cited reasons are: 
Pornography 56%, sale of sex equipment 13%, and threats to 
national security 11%, which includes criticisms of the king, government or military.2  This figure represents blocking done by all three government agencies.


In October 2006, 
MICT blocked 2475 websites by  request ; by 
January 11 
2007, this number had risen to 13,435 websites, a jump of more than 500%.  This brings the current total of websites blocked to more than 45,000. All websites are blocked in secret and the criteria for censorship has never been made public by government. However, the 
MICT 
blocklist must be made available to 
ISPs to block. 


Although the great majority of censored sites are pornographic, the list is liberally salted with an attempt to block all anonymous proxy servers which serve to circumvent Web-blocking and Internet gambling sites.  Pornography and gambling are specifically illegal in Thailand.




 Methods 


Websites are blocked by 
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and/or 




IP address



. However, only about 20% of blocked sites are identified by IP; the remaining 80% are unable to be identified at a physical location. If these sites could be identified as being located in Thailand, legal action could be taken against their operators. Thus, lack of IP is a major oversight.


Several technologies are employed to censor the Internet such as 
caching, blacklisting domain name or IP address, or simply redirection to a government homepage. Blacklisting the website is beneficial for this kind of web censorship as the webmasters would be unaware that their websites are being blocked. This measure is said to be used to make unpleasant websites appear unavailable.3


Many censored web sites previously redirected the user to a site hosted by the 
Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (
MICT) which states that the requested destination could not be displayed due to improper content. It should also be noted that censorship of the Internet in Thailand is currently for website access only. Unlike 

China
's 
 Great Firewall , which censors all Internet traffic including chat conversation via 
Instant Messaging, Thai Internet users are still able to interact with other users without being censored. However, current policy is to use a system of transparent proxies so that the user receives system, server, TCP and browser error messages when trying to access blocked sites leading the user to believe that the failure is caused in the Internet itself.


Search engine giants, 

Google
 and 

Yahoo!
, were approached to investigate the potential capability for blocking access to their cached web pages in Thailand, a common technique used to circumvent blocking. The search engines were also asked about blocking by keyword search which is used effectively in China to censor the Internet. 

Google
, at least, has made public a statement that it has no intention of blocking any sites to users in Thailand.



Wayback Engine, a project of 
Archive.org, currently caches 85 billion inactive web pages.  Some of these are now being blocked by the 
MICT. With 100 million active web pages, 10% of which are thought to be pornographic, the effect of 
MICT's censorship will only be negligible. 


Another, more disturbing, trend is the censorship of anti-coup websites such as 


19 September Network against Coup d'Etat

, which has been blocked six times, as of Febreuary 2007, with government refusing to acknowledge responsibility for the blocking.  


Internet webboards and discussion forums such as 
Midnight University,4 
Prachatai.com5 and 

Pantip.com
 have all been blocked so reasonable political discussion has been rendered impossible. Prachatai and Pantip have chosen to self-censor, closely monitoring each discussion, in order to remain unblocked.  In addition, video sharing sites such as Camfrog have recently been blocked with the grounds given that people were  behaving indecently  on webcams; the block was later reversed when it was discovered that Camfrog provided a principal means of communication for the handicapped, elderly and shut-ins. Other video sharing sites such as Metacafe remain blocked however. The entire video upload website, 

YouTube
, has suffered several blockings, including a complete ban between 
April 4, 
2007 and 
August 31, 
2007 due to a video which was considered to be offensive to the monarchy; YouTube's parent company, Google, was reported in the press to have agreed to assist the 
MICT in blocking individual videos rather than the entire website. The entire 

YouTube
 site block persisted for nearly five months, despite the fact that the video challenged by the 
MICT was voluntary deleted by the user who posted it.




 Southern insurgency 


Most sites concerning the 

violent political situation
 in Thailand's Muslim South are blocked, specifically those in support of the 
Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO), a banned group which works for a separate Muslim state, including PULO's appeals to the United Nations for redress.




 External news sites 


In addition, some web pages from 

BBC One
, 

BBC Two
, 

CNN
, 

Yahoo! News
, Seattle (USA) 
Post-Intelligencer newspaper, and 

The Age
 (Melbourne, Australia) newspaper dealing with Thai political content are blocked. More recently, all international coverage of Thaksin-in-exile has been blocked, including interviews with the deposed PM.


Thailand blocked Google's video sharing site 

YouTube
 beginning on 
April 4, 
2007, but 

Reuters
 reported on 6 April 2007 that the search company promised to help the Thai government block certain material on the site, making the rest legal to display in Thailand.6 The block remained in place until 
August 4, 
2007. 


Although the  interpretive biography  of Thailand's King Bhumibhol Adulyadej, The King Never Smiles by 
Paul Handley (Yale University Press) was published in July 2006, websites concerning the book had been blocked as far back as November 2005. As no advance reading copies or excerpts were made available, these sites were censored based on the book's title alone.  All sites with links to sales of the book are still blocked, including Yale University Press, Amazon. com, Amazon UK and many others.



 Wikipedia articles blocked 


Articles hosted by Wikipedia that have been blocked in Thailand include:




Bhumibol Adulyadej, 
October 10, 
2008, led to a w3.mict.go.th announcement:  Under Construction The site you are trying to view does not currently have a default page. It may be in the process of being upgraded and configured.   







 Protests 


Midnight University has filed a petition to the 
National Human Rights Commission of Thailand7 simultaneously with filing in the Administrative Court.8  As the Court and the Council of State can find no laws which permit Internet censorship, Midnight University has been granted a restraining order against further blocking, pending resolution of its legal case.  This makes Midnight University the only legally-protected website in Thailand.


Interference in communication, including the Internet, was specifically prohibited by Section 37 of the 1997  People's  Constitution and free speech protected by Section 39.9 However, following the pattern of past coups, the military's first action was to scrap the Constitution and establish drafting a new one. Nevertheless, the 
MICT has commissioned the Law Faculty of Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University to find laws or loopholes which permit such censorship.



Freedom Against Censorship Thailand (
FACT)10 filed a petition against all censorship before the 
National Human Rights Commission on 
November 15 
2006. 
FACT's petition is still open for signatures and actively seeks all international support.11



NHRC has no enforcement capability so, typically, any government body can simply refuse or fail to give evidence.  This was the case with 
FACT's petition.  However, on 
January 26 
2007, the 
MICT agreed to cooperate with this process.


The Official Information Act12 established in law by the 1997 Constitution was promulgated to enforce transparency in government. On 
February 9 
2007 
FACT filed an official information request with the 
MICT.13  Its 20 questions, signed by 257 individuals supported by 57 international civil liberties and human rights groups,14 must be answered with two exceptions.  



MICT has refused to reply citing grounds of  national security  and  interference with law enforcement  rather than make its secret blocklist, the criteria used for censorship and the specific procedures it uses, public. 
FACT has filed a complaint requiring an investigation within 60 days (from 
March 23 
2007) by the Official Information Commission15 under the Prime Minister's Office. If this, too, fails, a legal case seeking a restraining order against further censorship will be initiated.


Software applications for circumventing web-blocking are readily available.

plugins such as [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2278 Ghostfox] and 
EZtor are available for free download from the Internet and are made available on disk by the 
Freedom Against Censorship Thailand. The Minister of Information Communications and Technology has said in an interview in the 

Bangkok Post
 that he has not blocked these methods because  using proxies to access illegal sites are illegal, whereas using proxies to access legal sites is legal.

Cuculus horsfieldi''




Horsfield's Cuckoo or Oriental Cuckoo (Cuculus optatus) is a 
bird belonging to the genus 
Cuculus in the 
cuckoo family Cuculidae. It was formerly classified as a 
subspecies of 
Cuculus saturatus but differences in voice and size suggest that it should be treated as a separate species.2 Some authors use the names Horsfield's Cuckoo for optatus and Oriental Cuckoo for saturatus while others use Oriental Cuckoo for optatus and Himalayan Cuckoo for saturatus.


The 
binomial name Cuculus horsfieldi has often been used for Horsfield's Cuckoo. However, this name is a 
junior synonym of Cuculus optatus.3



Description


It is 30-32 centimetres long with a wingspan of 51-57 centimetres and a weight of 73-156 grams. The adult male has a grey head, breast and upperparts. The belly is creamy-white with dark bars. The vent is frequently buff with few markings. The legs and feet are orange-yellow and there is a bare yellow ring around the eye. Adult females and 
juveniles occur in two 
morphs. The grey morph is similar to the male but has a brownish wash on the breast. The rufous morph is reddish-brown above, paler on the underparts and with strong dark barring all over including the rump.






Photographed at Maiala NP, SE Queensland, Australia






The 





Common Cuckoo




 (C. canorus) is very similar in appearance but is slightly bulkier with longer wings and tail and a slightly smaller head and bill. It is slightly paler grey and the barring on the underparts is a little narrower. The vent is usually white with dark bars but is more similar to Horsfield's Cuckoo in a few individuals. Birds of the rufous morph have a plain rump with no dark bars unlike Horsfield's Cuckoo. 


The Himalayan Cuckoo (C. saturatus) is extremely similar to Horsfield's Cuckoo but is slightly smaller and shorter-winged.


The call of the male Horsfield's Cuckoo is a series of low paired notes,  poo-poo , with both notes stressed equally. It is somewhat similar to the call of the 
Hoopoe. It may be introduced with a four to eight note phrase or sometimes with grating notes. The female's call is a deep bubbling trill. Outside the breeding season, the birds are usually silent. The call of the male Himalayan Cuckoo is a series of three or four note phrases with a short, high-pitched introductory note.




Distribution


It has a large breeding range in northern 
Eurasia. It breeds across much of 

Russia
 west to the 

Komi Republic
 with occasional records as far west as 

Saint Petersburg
. It also breeds in northern 

Kazakhstan
, 

Mongolia
, northern 
China, 

Korea
 and 
Japan. There have been records of birds displaying in 

Finland
 in recent years but their identification is no longer considered certain. 


The exact extent of its wintering range is uncertain due to its secretive habits and the difficulty of separating it from the Himalayan Cuckoo and other similar species. It is believed to include the 


Malay Peninsula

, 

Indonesia
, the 

Philippines
, 

New Guinea
, western 




Micronesia



, the 

Solomon Islands
 and northern and eastern 

Australia
 with occasional birds reaching 









New Zealand








. It has occurred as a 
vagrant in 

Ukraine
, 

Israel
 and 

Alaska
.




Ecology


It mainly inhabits 
forests, occurring in 
coniferous, 
deciduous and mixed forest. It feeds mainly on 
insects and their 
larvae, foraging for them in trees and bushes as well as on the ground. It is usually secretive and hard to see.


It is a 
brood parasite, laying its 
eggs in the nests of other birds. The nests of 
Phylloscopus warblers such as the 




Arctic Warbler



, 
Eastern Crowned Warbler, 




Willow Warbler



 and 




Chiffchaff



 are commonly used. Other hosts include the 




Olive-backed Pipit



 and 
Asian Stubtail. The eggs are smooth, slightly glossy and vary in colour, sometimes mimicking those of the host species. They are 
incubated for about 12 days. The young cuckoo is born naked and has an orange gape with black patches. Within a few days it pushes the eggs or young of the host out of the nest. Older nestlings have blackish feathers with white fringes; the belly is dark brown with white bands. The young birds 
fledge after around 17-19 days.

The Shvetsov ASh-73 started life in 1938 from a specification for a 18-cylinder, twin-row, air-cooled, radial engine.  Contrary to popular belief the ASh-73 wasn't a reverse engineered copy of the 






Wright R-3350





, rather the ASh-73 was the product of a similar specification.  Since the earlier 






Shvetsov M-25





 engines were a licensed copy of the 






Wright R-1820





, there were similarities and some parts were interchangeable between the R-3350 and the ASh-73.  The two engines evolved from a common ancestor and from a similar requirement.  

The original project designation for the ASh-73 was the M-70.  The M-70 was tested in late 1938 and was a failure.  The M-71 of 1940, was the successor to the M-70 and it too was a failure.  The M-71 was in turn succeeded by the M-72 of early 1945, which although moderately successful wasn't placed in production.  The first prototypes of the ASh-73 were built in 1945 and by the end of 1946 testing had completed successfully and the first models to enter production in 1947 lacked turbo-superchargers.  Later turbo-superchargers were fitted and these were direct copies of the units used on the R-3350.  The ASh-73 was produced until 1957 and 14,310 were built.

Edward Reynolds

28 July 1676




Edward Reynolds (November 
1599 - 
28 July 
1676) was a 
bishop of Norwich in the 

Church of England
 and an author.1

He was born in Holyrood parish 

Southampton
, the son of Augustine (Austin) Reynolds, one of the customers of the city, and his wife, Bridget. 



 Career 


In 1615, Reynolds became postmaster of 
Merton College and in 1620, probationer fellow. In 1622 he was made preacher at 



Lincoln's Inn


, and in 1631 rector of 

Braunston
, in 

Northamptonshire
; but in the rebellion of 1642 he sided with the 
Presbyterians.1
In 1643 he was one of the 


Westminster Assembly

 divines, and took the covenant in 1644. In 1648 he became dean of 









Christ Church








 and vice-chancellor of the 

University of Oxford
. He refused the engagement (1651) and despite his promise of obedience to the law, but not subscription to the oath in Humble Proposals of Sundry Learned and Pious Divines (1649), this  was insufficient to save him; he lost the vice-chancellorship in September 1650. He was ejected from his deanery the following March, despite a last minute pledge to subscribe in a limited sense.2  He preached before parliament in January 1657, and the same year he became vicar of 





St Lawrence Jewry




, London, but was restored to his deanery in 1659.1


After the death of 


Oliver Cromwell

, he and other presbyterians sought an accommodation with 

Richard Cromwell
, and on 11 October 1658, on behalf of himself and other London presbyterian ministers, Reynolds delivered an oral address to the new protector. In 1659 he preached at the opening session of parliament, and his sermons to parliament and London notables throughout 1659 and 1660 became increasingly pointed about the need for peace, unity, and moderation, codes for the restoration of the monarchy and accommodation with 
episcopalians.2




After the Restoration


At the 
Restoration in 1660, he was made chaplain to 


Charles II

. In the same year he was elected warden of Merton College, and made bishop of Norwich. His contribution to the 






Book of Common Prayer





 is The General Thanksgiving prayer which is part of the office of 
Morning Prayer.1 His collected works were published in 1658, again in 1679 and, with a memoir of his life by Alexander Chambers, in 1826.2




 Later years and death 


In his later years Reynolds was severely afflicted by 
the stone and 
strangury, and he died on 
28 July 
1676 at his bishop's palace. He was buried on 9 August in the bishop's chapel he had newly built at Norwich. He was survived by his wife Mary.2
