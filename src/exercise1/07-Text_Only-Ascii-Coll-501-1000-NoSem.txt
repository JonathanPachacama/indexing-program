Kenwood House



Kenwood House (also known as the Iveagh Bequest) is a former 
stately home, in 

Hampstead
, 

London
, on the northern boundary of 





Hampstead Heath




. It is managed by 


English Heritage

.


History





Elevations of the north and south fronts of Kenwood by Robert and James Adam






The library



The original house dates from the early 17th century. The 
orangery was added in about 1700. In 1754 it was bought by 


William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield

. He commissioned 

Robert Adam
 to remodel it from 1764-1779. Adam added the library (one of his most famous interiors) to balance the orangery, and added the 






Ionic





 portico at the entrance. In 1793-6 George Saunders added two wings on the north side, and the offices and kitchen buildings and brewery (now the restaurant) to the side.


It was donated to the nation by 

















Lord Iveagh
















, a member of the 

Guinness family
, when he died in 1927, and opened to the public in 1928. He had bought the house from the Mansfield family in 1925. Unfortunately the furnishing had already been sold by then, so the house is largely empty. Some furniture has since been added. The paintings are from Iveagh's collection. Part of the grounds were bought by the Kenwood Preservation Council in 1922, after there had been threats that it would be sold for building. In the late 1990s the house received approximately 150,000 visitors a year and an estimated 1 million people visited the grounds each year.1


The house was the subject of a 





Margaret Calkin James




 poster in the 1930s, and was seen by a myriad commuters on the 








London Underground







.


The 











British










 feature film 
Notting Hill was partly filmed here.

Estate


The estate has a designed landscape with gardens near the house, probably originally designed by 








Humphry Repton







, contrasting with some surrounding woodland, and the naturalistic Hampstead Heath to the south. There is also a new garden by 
Arabella Lennox-Boyd.


One third of the estate is a 






Site of Special Scientific Interest





, particularly the ancient woodlands. These are home to many birds and insects and the largest 






Pipistrelle bat





 roost in 

London
.


There are sculptures by 






Barbara Hepworth





, 

Henry Moore
 and 







Reg Butler






 in the gardens near the house.

Music concerts, originally classical but in more recent years predominantly pop concerts, were held by the lake on Saturday evenings every summer from 1951 until 2006, attracting thousands of people to picnic and enjoy the music, scenery and spectacular fireworks. In February 2007, English Heritage  decided to abandon these concerts owing to restrictions placed on them after protests from some local residents. The future of Kenwood House is now uncertain, as English Heritage depended on the income from the Lakeside Concerts to maintain the house at a cost of around a million pounds per year.2. On 19 March 2008, it was announced that the concerts would return to a new location on the Pasture Ground within the Kenwood Estate, with the number of concerts limited to 8 per season.3.

Hans Schuler's monument in 

Baltimore
 honoring poet and musician 




Sidney Lanier



. According to the Smithsonian archive (see external links), the monument dates from 1941, was dedicated in 1942, and measures approximately 126 x 168 x 99 inches.




Hans K. Schuler (
May 25, 
1874 - 
March 30, 
1951) was a German-born American 
sculptor and monument maker. He was born in 





Alsace-Lorraine




 (in what is now part of France), and his family emigrated to the United States while he was still a youngster.  He graduated from the 

Maryland Institute College of Art
 (MICA) in 

Baltimore, Maryland
, having studied there at the 






Rinehart





 School of Sculpture. 


He continued his studies in France at the Julien Academy, studying under Raoul Verlet 
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Verlet 
http://www.artfact.com/catalog/viewLot.cfm?iid=6851046 ri=3. Schuler won the 
Salon Gold Medal in 

Paris
 in 1901, the first American sculptor ever to do so. Returning to Baltimore, he built his studio at  7 East Lafayette Avenue in 1906 
http://www.schulerschooloffinearts.com/, residing and working in Baltimore for the rest of his life. Schuler served as president of MICA from 1925 to 1951. His works are in the collections of museums including the 

National Gallery of Art
 in 
Washington, DC and the 




Walters Art Museum



 in 
Baltimore. His Baltimore studio is still in use as the Schuler School of Fine Arts, founded in 1959 by sculptor Hans C. Schuler (1912-1999), the son of Hans K. Schuler. The Schuler studio/school is on the 





National Register of Historic Places




.


Schuler's sculptures and monuments grace many public places. Among them is a statue of 

U.S. President
 




James Buchanan



 in 









Meridian Hill Park








 in 

Washington, D.C.
 It is the only public memorial dedicated to Buchanan. On Baltimore's Charles Street, in the area of the main campus of 

Johns Hopkins University
, there are also imposing monuments by Schuler honoring 

Johns Hopkins
 and 




Sidney Lanier



. All three of these monuments are large bronzes occupying elaborate stone placements. Schuler's sculptures and reliefs also adorn the interiors of many public buildings. For example, Schuler, along with sculptor 
J. Maxwell Miller, created a large relief panel which is located in the main concert hall at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore.


While Hans Schuler created many public monuments, he also created extremely sensual examples of free sculpture, including a life-sized and very life-like marble nude - now at the 




Walters Art Museum



 - representing the abandoned 
Ariadne, writhing in sadness and longing. Below is a link to an image and auction record of another Schuler piece of this type, recently sold at 
Christies in 

London
.


Other works by Schuler can be found in the 

Arlington National Cemetery

Annapolis, Maryland
), 

Louisiana State University
, 

State University of New York
, (

Albany
 and 
Bronx), and in various parks in the 

Baltimore
 and  
Washington D.C. area. He is buried in 






Loudon Park National Cemetery





. 


Schuler was a member of the 

National Sculpture Society
 and exhibited in their 1923 exhibition. 1



Cemetery monuments





Riggs Memorial in 
Greenmount Cemetery, Baltimore, with bronze sculpture by Hans Schuler



Like many of the successful sculptors of his day, Schuler created quite a few cemetery memorials.  Many of these sculptures are life-sized or even larger than life-sized bronze human figures. Often the figures sit or sprawl across the tombstones in an attitude of grief, nostalgia, pensiveness, or anguish, like fellow mourners at the grave, or ghosts sociably mingling with the living, instead of being perched neatly on pedestals. The Riggs memorial, shown at right, is a good example. The Lanier monument pictured above, while not being a cemetery sculpture, also exemplifies Schuler's knack for presenting figures in this way. Most of the cemetery pieces are located in and around Baltimore. They include:





Key Memorial, Cathedral Cemetery


Hinrich Memorial,

In his proper left hand he holds an open book and in his proper right he holds a pencil. His flute is by his proper right leg. He is dressed in a suit with a vest and overcoat, his full beard spreads over the opening of his vest as he tilts his head slightly downward toward his book. He leans back against a boulder which is carved with a relief depicting a landscape and two allegorical female figures. They hold hands, one also holding an unrolled scroll, and the other one also holding a musical instrument.

 Except where noted otherwise, data are given for materials in their 
standard state(at 25  C, 100 kPa)




FOX-7 or 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene is an insensitive high power explosive compound.  It was first synthesized in 1998 by the FOA Defence Research Establishment (Sweden).
1


FOX-7 is similar to the insensitive chemical compound 





TATB




, which is a 
benzene ring compound with three 
amino and three 
nitro groups.  FOX-7 has a linear two-carbon backbone rather than a benzene ring, but the amino and nitro groups have similar effects in both cases according to published reports on sensitivity and chemical decay processes of FOX-7. FOX-7 is today produced by Eureco Bofors AB in Sweden.  


Its explosive properties appear extremely favorable; in addition to its insensitive properties, the detonation velocity of mixtures of 80% FOX-7 plus binders are as high as 
Composition B, and nearly pure FOX-7 based 
plastic bonded explosives are slightly superior to 
RDX.  
2 FOX-7 has been calculated to have a 
detonation velocity of 8,870 m/s.1


Due to its small-scale production, the cost of FOX-7 is relatively high.  However, the production is based a commercial starting material and the synthesis is uncomplicated.  The price is therefore predicted to fall as production scale increases.  There is no current full scale use of FOX-7, but it is being tested at several military research centers.  The need for less sensitive munition is the most important driver for testing FOX-7.

Texas border disputes
Spanish Texas




The Long Expedition, named after its leader, 
James Long, was an early attempt by 
Anglo-Americans to wrest 


Texas

 from 



Spain


. The expedition was mounted by volunteers from 

Natchez, Mississippi
, who disputed the exact boundary of the 
Louisiana Purchase, believing it to extend deeply into Texas. The expedition attracted recruits with the promise of a 


league

 of land to every volunteer. An advance force of 120 men, led by Eli Harris, crossed the 
Sabine River on 
June 8, 
1819, and marched to 

Nacogdoches, Texas
, where Long arrived on 
June 21. Independence minded citizens of Nacogdoches met to organize a provisional government, naming Long as its head. On 
June 23, this  Supreme Council  declared the independence of Texas from Spain.

By mid July, Long had more than 300 men under his command, but lack of supplies caused him to scatter his forces to live off the country. In late September, however, the Spanish governor sent more than 500 men to drive Long out of Texas. One month later the American  liberators  had all been forced out of disputed East Texas. 


Long himself avoided capture by fleeing to 

New Orleans
. Undeterred by the failure of his first expedition, he joined forces with 
Jose Felix Trespalacios, who was organizing an expedition in New Orleans to support the Mexican liberals. 


Long established his headquarters at 


Point Bolivar

. At Point Bolivar, in April 
1820, Long attempted to reorganize his forces. With the aid of 
Ben Milam and others, Long revitalized the Supreme Council. He later broke with Milam, and the expedition led an uncertain existence until 
September 19, 
1821, when Long and fifty-two men sailed to capture 
Presidio La Bahia. The town fell easily on 
October 4, but four days later Long was forced to surrender. He was taken prisoner and sent to 


Mexico City

, where about six months later he was shot and killed by a guard reportedly bribed to do so by Trespalacios.

English idioms




For other uses, see 
Gravy train (disambiguation).


 Gravy train  is an 
idiomatic expression that is used to refer to any lucrative endeavour.1


The word  gravy  by itself was used prior to the invention of the phrase  gravy train  as an 
interjection of pleasure at something that's easy to do with a great reward, or as an adjective to describe such a situation, a la 'cushy'.  An easy task.


In politics,  gravy train  refers to a depraved gorging on luxuries, since someone else foots the bill.

Johnson further states that the next day Kelson laughingly told him that the New Haven lockup was  a gravy train.

El Puerto de Santa Maria (Spanish for  The port/harbour of 
Saint Mary , locally known as just El Puerto) is a city located on the banks of the 



Guadalete River


 in the province of 
Cadiz, 



Spain


. According to the 
2005 
census, the city has a population of 82,306, of which 50,000 live in the urban center, and the remainder in the surrounding areas.

The town of El Puerto de Santa Maria is 10 km north east of Cadiz across the bay of Cadiz and is best known for its ferry El Vaporcito which has been in operation for 76 years carrying passengers to and from Cadiz to El Puerto. 



History



According to the legend told in the 
Odyssey of 
Homer, after the 
Trojan War a Greek official named 










Menestheus









 escaped with his troops through the Straits of Gibraltar and reached the Guadalete River. They established themselves here and called that port Menestheus's port. 


In 711, Arab (
Moors) from the North of Africa invaded southern Spain. They renamed the place Alcante or Alcanatif which means Port of Salt, due to the old salt industry of 


Phoenicia

ns and 
Romans. 


In 
1260, 













Alfonso X of Castile












 conquered the city from the Moors and renamed it Santa Maria del Puerto. He organized the land distribution and conceded a charter under the Crown of Castile.
In his 



Cantigas de Santa Maria


 
CSM 367, Alfonso sings that he was miraculously healed of swollen legs after visiting his church of Santa Maria do Porto.





De la Cosa's map.







Christopher Columbus
's second expedition to the Americas set sail from El Puerto de Santa Maria. His pilot, 







Juan de la Cosa






 drew 
his world map (the first including the coast of New World) in El Puerto in 1500.


Columbus visited El Puerto in 
1480 and received encouragement for his travel plans. He also met Juan de la Cosa who issued the first world map in 1500. 


El Puerto was the residence of several wealthy cargadores, merchants who operated Spain's trade with the Americas.


During the 16th and 17th centuries, it was the winter port of the royal 
galleys.


In the nineteenth century the city became the General Headquarters for the French Army during the War of Independence (

Peninsular War
) under the reign of 
Jose Bonaparte (1801-1812). 


The town is seeped in history, museums and monuments. It is also within easy reach of the historical cities of 










Seville









 and 
Cadiz.

El Puerto de Santa Maria is located on the 
Atlantic coast of the 
Bay of Cadiz, near the municipalities of 








Jerez de la Frontera







, 
Rota, 








Puerto Real







, and 
Cadiz. It is popular for its beaches, which are the town's principal tourist attraction. Well known beaches include Vistahermosa, Valdelagrana, and La Puntilla. Like many other southern cities, there are many smaller towns encompassed by the municipality. There is also a major port, known as Puerto Sherry. A large amount of land has been devoted to the Bay of Cadiz Nature Reserve.

tourism, mainly because of the beaches, as well as the bullfights held at the arena during the summer. The town also hosts large groups of 
motorcyclists during the Jerez 
Motorcycle Grand Prix. There is commercial development in the center and periphery, and a highly developed 
wine industry.

Tourism





Bull ring



El Puerto has a famous 
bullring which dates back to 
1880 with space for 15,000 spectators. 
Bullfighting is still enjoyed during the Feria season during the month of August, and during the Feria de la Primavera (Spring Fair) in early May. This Feria is dedicated to 
sherry wine and 180,000 half bottles are drunk in 4 days. There are several bodegas (wineries) in the town centre, all of which can be visited by the public. The most famous bodegas in El Puerto are Osborne and Terry both of which export sherry and brandy worldwide. In the cellars of El Puerto, the dry, pale sherry known as 
Fino is produced using the traditional method called 
solera. This method produces Fino, the sweet Muscatel, 
Amontillado and the older 
Oloroso.


El Puerto is an excellent place to sample local 
tapas and seafood, for which it is famous. Food is an important reason why El Puerto de Santa Maria attracts hundreds of tourists. The 
Bay of Cadiz is famous for its fresh seafood and that, teamed with the abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables leads to excellent restaurant menus. Most tourists head for the Rivera del Marisco where you can by seafood in paper cones to take away or eat at the tables. There are a wide variety of eateries all located with walking distance in the town centre.


El Puerto has escaped the mass tourism of the 



Costa del Sol


 and remains unspoilt, natural and very picturesque.
During the summer months the town bursts with life.
Most of the town is on the north bank of the Rio Guadelete, where bars and restaurants line the palm-covered streets. Entertainment is lively in the summer in the town centre and in Vistahermosa everything starts very late and goes on well into the early hours, hence the famous Spanish siesta.


The climate is one of El Puerto s best features with endless days of sunshine. Even during the winter months, temperatures rarely fall below 20 degrees. With more than three thousand hours of sunshine, fine sandy beaches and blue seas, El Puerto de Santa Maria on the 



Costa de la Luz


 (the Coast of Light) is a popular holiday location.
For nature lovers, El Puerto de Santa Maria is situated in the middle of the Parque natural Bahia de Cadiz There are two square kilometres of pine forest which form one part of the three ecosystems in the area. An endangered species of chameleon along with other reptiles and birds of immense variety can be found in the forest. 




Andalusia



 s wildlife is the most varied in Europe, with fauna and flora in protected areas. The area boasts of two Natural parks, the Sierra de Grazalema and El Coto Donana, both within driving distance and well worth a visit.

Robert Swift (born 
December 3, 
1985, in 

Bakersfield, California
) is an 








American







 professional 
basketball player for the 
Oklahoma City Thunder of the 
NBA. He stands 7 feet 1 inches tall and plays the 
center position.


High school


Swift caught the attention of 
NBA and college scouts while playing for 




Garces Memorial High School



, and then later as the centerpiece of the 



Bakersfield High School


 team.


During his time at Garces, the small Catholic high school broke into the 

USA Today
 top-25 high school basketball team rankings. Between his junior and senior years, Swift transferred from Garces to 

Highland High School
, and then just before his senior year, he transferred once more into Bakersfield High School. This move provoked a hearing by the 







California Interscholastic Federation






 that initially declared Swift ineligible for the 2003 04 season; however it was later overturned and he played his senior season.1




College


In 2004, Swift bypassed college and opted for the NBA, turning down an offer from 


USC

.




NBA


Swift was selected by the 



Seattle SuperSonics


 in the first round with the twelfth overall pick in the 
2004 NBA Draft. In his first season he played in 16 games, averaging 4.5 minutes, 0.9 points, 0.4 rebounds, and 0.4 blocks per game. In his second season, under the direction of coach 






Bob Hill





, he started 20 out of 47 games, averaging 21 minutes, 6.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 1.19 blocks per game.


In 2006 Swift was awarded the starting job at center but disaster struck when he ruptured the 
ACL in his right knee after playing just over one minute in a pre-season game vs the 









Sacramento Kings








. The resulting injury occurred when he twisted his right knee when he fell and went out of bounds awkwardly in front of the Seattle bench.2 Swift suffered another injury to his right knee in February 2008, a torn 
lateral meniscus3.

Kodomomuke anime (       , Kodomomuke anime) is a 
Japanese term that literally means  animation directed towards children . It refers to a genre of Japanese comics (
manga) and cartoons (
anime) that are aimed at a younger audience. However, for many non-Japanese fans of these media, the name is cut to simply Kodomo.


 Kodomo  works are noted for stories that are usually (and covertly) very moralistic and teach children how to behave as good and considerate people.  The episodes are also standalone and non-episodic in order to appeal to a child's short attention span.



 List of kodomo anime and manga 



Examples of  kodomo  works include:






Doraemon - about a boy and a cat-like robot from the future that has come to keep the boy out of trouble. 



Soreike! Anpanman - about a hero whose head is made of bread and his food themed friends.

















Hamtaro













 - about a group of hamsters and their owners.



Animal Yokoch  - about a preschooler who discovers a door to another world in her floor and the three stuffed-animal-like creatures who frequently visit her through the door.



Doubutsu no Mori Hohinda Mura da Yori - Comic based on 





Animal Crossing




 series.

Sports venues in Maryland




Harry Grove Stadium, located in 

Frederick, Maryland
, is the home of the 








Frederick Keys







, a class A minor league affiliate of the 




Baltimore Orioles



. Opened in 1990, it seats 5,400 fans. 

The stadium is named for Harry Grove, one of the founders of the Frederick Hustlers, a professional team that existed between 1915 and the 







World War II






 era.  The Grove family also donated $250,000 to the city to help build the park and were thus honored in the naming of it.  Another $1 million was provided by the city of Frederick along with $1.5 million provided by the state of Maryland and $250,000 from 

Frederick County
.1  


The 2005 Class A all-star game, pitting the 

Carolina League
 against the 

California League
, was played in Harry Grove.


Harry Grove Stadium has also been the host of various concerts.  On August 19th, 2006, 


Bob Dylan

 played to a sell-out crowd during his third annual 'Summer Minor League Baseball Park Tour'. The 

World Wrestling Entertainment
 (WWE) has made it an annual summer stop on its live event tours, a rarity in that it is an outdoor venue.

This article is about the restaurant chain.  For the comic book character, see 
Red Robin (comics).


Red Robin (


NASDAQ

: 
RRGB) is a 
chain of 
casual dining 
restaurants founded in 1969 in 

Seattle, Washington
, USA, and now headquartered in 

Greenwood Village, Colorado
.1 The chain is best known for its gourmet 
burgers and bottomless 
steak fries as well as its freckled lemonade. 


The first Red Robin still stands at the corner of Furhman and Eastlake avenues E. in Seattle, at the southern end of the 



University Bridge


. This building dates from 1940 and was first called Sam's Tavern. The owner, Sam, sang in a 
barber shop quartet and could frequently be heard singing,  When the red, red robin goes bob, bob, bobbin' along.  (Henry Woods). He liked the song so much that he eventually changed the name to Sam's Red Robin.2 





A Red Robin restaurant in Tukwila, Washington



They eventually dropped the  Sam  and simply became Red Robin. The first restaurant was 1,200 sq ft (110 m2). In 1973, the restaurant expanded their business to include their most well-known hamburgers including the Red Robin Bacon Cheeseburger and the Royal Red Robin Burger which has a fried egg on the patty. Local Seattle restaurant entrepreneur Gerry Kingen bought the restaurant and expanded it. 


In 1979, Red Robin regulars, Mike and Steve Snyder, decided to open their own Red Robin in Yakima, Wash. The Snyder Group Company became Red Robin's first franchisee. In 1980, Red Robin was well on its way to becoming  America's Gourmet Burgers   Spirits  by opening a restaurant in Portland, Ore. In 1983, Red Robin adopted a mascot named Red.  In 1985, the headquarters was moved from dowtown Seattle to suburban Colorado after Kingen sold a controlling interest in Red Robin Corp. to The Skylark Corporation of Japan.  With marginal successes and poor financial performance under Skylark's management, Kingen, then a minority owner, in 1995 stepped back into the CEO position to nurse the company back to profitibility. In 1994, the company introduced its  Bottomless Steak Fries.  In 2000, the company celebrated the opening of its 150th restaurant. As of February 2007, there are 307 locations across the 








United States







 and 18 in 

Canada

USS Wadleigh (DD-689) was a 



 Fletcher-class


 
destroyer of the 






United States Navy





, named for Rear Admiral 











George H. Wadleigh










 (1842 1927).


Wadleigh was laid down on 5 April 1943 at 

Bath, Maine
, by the 


Bath Iron Works

; 
launched on 7 August 1943; sponsored by Miss Clara F. Wadleigh, daughter of RAdm. Wadleigh; and commissioned at the 











Boston Navy Yard










 on 19 October 1943, Lieutenant Commander Walter C. Winn in command.



 World War II 



Following shakedown training in the 
West Indies, Wadleigh rendezvoused in the mid-Atlantic with 
Iowa'', 
Halsey Powell'', and 
Marshall''. The three destroyers escorted the 
battleship as she carried President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt back to the United States from talks with other Allied leaders at the 





Cairo Conference




.



 1944 



Soon after her return from this special escort duty, Wadleigh got underway from 
Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 3 January 1944 and steamed via 

Panama
 to 


Pearl Harbor

.


Her baptism of fire came on 20 March 1944 during the 
Marshall Islands campaign. Assigned shore-bombardment duties, Wadleigh in company with 
McCalla'' and 
Sage''  supported 
LCIs and 










LST









s during the landings on 
Ailinglapalap and expended 478 rounds of 5 inch shells which destroyed an enemy-held village. Three days later, the new destroyer again took part in shooting up Japanese defenses, shelling a weather station and a radio station on 






Ebon Island





, helping to clear the way for the 1,500 







marines






 who soon took the island.


The ship returned to the 
Hawaiian Islands for further operational training in preparation for the upcoming conquest of the 




Marianas



. Assigned to Task Group 52.4 (TG 52.4), Wadleigh arrived off 


Roi Island

 in the Marshalls on 10 June, five days before 
D-Day for the 

invasion of Saipan Island
. The day before the first landings, the warship closed 












Saipan











 and commenced fire early in the morning, beginning her part in the operations designed to  soften up  the enemy defenses.


On D-Day, Wadleigh lay offshore, providing predawn gunfire support for 
underwater demolition teams (UDTs) and for the initial waves of troops. After spending the day in shelling enemy positions, she retired seaward to conduct screening patrols. While thus engaged, Wadleigh and 
Melvin'' both picked up strong 
sonar contacts with a 
submarine west of 











Tinian










. Both ships went to general quarters and attacked, dropping 
depth charges with deadly precision. A heavy explosion, followed by a widening slick of oil and debris, indicated that whatever had been down there had been heavily hit. Postwar accounting revealed that the two destroyers had teamed to sink the 
Japanese submarine RO-114''.


Assigned to bombard 








Garapan







, the capital city of Saipan, Wadleigh encountered heavy activity of all types in this area, from both friend and foe alike, while expending some 1,700 rounds of 5 inch shells against the Japanese-held island. Not only was Wadleigh fired on by a Japanese shore battery, but the doughty destroyer was also straddled by a stick of bombs from a Japanese plane, mistaken for a low-flying aircraft by American forces, and again taken under fire from shore all within a hair-raising space of 15 minutes! During the latter days of the campaign Wadleigh shot enemy snipers out of caves, trees, and cliffs; picked up an occasional Japanese prisoner, and rescued downed American aircrews shot down near her position.


Following escort runs to 
Eniwetok and 

Guadalcanal
, Wadleigh was assigned to support the invasion of the 
Palaus. On 15 September, she patrolled north of the islands on 
radar picket duty, standing ready to provide early warning if Japanese planes were sighted.


On the following day, Wadleigh steamed to 
Kossol Roads to begin assisting 





minesweeper




s in clearing the sealanes there. Floating 





mines




 swept up by the minesweepers provided the destroyers with  game , and Wadleigh destroyed 22 with 40-millimeter fire. The 23d, however, was deadly. While approaching one mine, the destroyer brushed horns with another, an unswept mine which burst amidships. The explosion ripped into the bowels of the ship, killing three men and injuring 20, while flooding three engineering compartments and one living space. As the crew raced to general quarters, the ship settled five feet by the stern, and listed seven degrees to starboard. Wadleigh now sporting a 40-foot rent in her bottom came to an even keel as the crew manhandled all moveable weight from starboard to port to correct the list.



Bennett'' passed a towline and towed the stricken destroyer out of danger. The crippled ship, now sagging noticeably amidships,  worked  noticeably in the swells, prompting initial fears that the ship was breaking in two. In addition, the shock of the blast snapped one radar antenna and jarred both 26-foot motor 
whaleboats from their blocks.




 1945 



After temporary repairs, the ship painfully made her way back to Pearl Harbor and thence proceeded to the west coast to enter the 
Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs. Nearly rebuilt from the keel up, Wadleigh emerged from Mare Island on 20 February 1945 for speed trials and gunnery shoots. She departed San Diego, California, on 19 April and arrived at Pearl Harbor on April 25, in company with 
Charrette'', to conduct type-training exercises in the Hawaiian Islands.


She departed Pearl Harbor on 3 May, bound for 













Ulithi












, and arrived there after an 11-day passage. Rejoining her old unit 
Destroyer Squadron 54 (DesRon 54) the destroyer sortied with other 
5th Fleet units on May 25. After serving several tours on radar picket stations with the Fleet, Wadleigh weathered heavy 
typhoons from 5 to 7 June and subsequently accompanied 
Alaska'' and 
Guam'' in a shore bombardment mission to 
Minami Daito Shima (
Rasa Island) on the 9th, demolishing radar installations and buildings.


After a rest period in the 

Philippines
, Wadleigh sailed again for Japanese waters to screen the 
aircraft carriers as they continued to pound the Japanese home islands. On 10 July, the ship embarked a party of dignitaries including Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air, 
John L. Sullivan, and Vice Admiral 
Aubrey W. Fitch, for transportation to 





Iwo Jima




.


Rendezvousing with 
Ticonderoga'' at 

Guam
, she rejoined her task force on 21 July to support offensive operations off Japan's doorstep. While serving on occasion 50 miles from the enemy shore, Wadleigh rescued two downed Navy aircrewmen who had been shot down during a strike on Tokyo.


The destroyer slowed to destroy a derelict mine on 10 August, but excessive turbine vibrations forced the ship to shut down her starboard engine. Detached from the task force, Wadleigh limped back to Ulithi, in a convoy of replenishment ships and 





tanker




s, for repairs. While en route, she received word of the Japanese capitulation.


Departing Ulithi on 23 August and hoping to rejoin the Fleet in time for the triumphal entry into 







Tokyo Bay






, Wadleigh stopped at Iwo Jima en route for passengers and mail and arrived 24 hours after the first ships had entered the bay. Ordered to proceed directly to 
Sagami Wan, Wadleigh went to general quarters in company with 
Benevolence'' as the ships passed beneath the once-menacing shore batteries along the 
Urage Strait. They soon arrived at their destination, the 
Yokosuka Naval Base, on 29 August.


As the first American troops went ashore at 








Yokohama







 and Yokosuka, Wadleigh headed out to sea and rendezvoused with incoming carrier groups. She returned to her anchorage, near 
Missouri'', on 2 September in time to be on hand when the official surrender accords were signed that day.


Back at sea with the carriers once more, Wadleigh patrolled off the Japanese coast for two weeks, before she departed Nipponese waters on 16 September and proceeded via Eniwetok to Saipan in company with 
Bennington'' and 
Lexington'' for air group replacements. The destroyer returned to Tokyo Bay after a week at Saipan and arrived on 13 October, escorting 
Belleau Wood'' and Lexington.


Departing Japanese waters on 20 October, bound for the Hawaiian Islands, Wadleigh carried a load of men eligible for discharge upon their return to the United States. After a 48-hour layover in the Hawaiian Islands, she pressed on for San Francisco, arriving on 5 November 1945. She commenced a preinactivation overhaul on 5 December and sailed for San Diego, California, on 27 January 1946, for inactivation. The destroyer was placed out of commission, in reserve, in the San Diego group of the 
Pacific Reserve Fleet, in January 1947.





 1951   1962 



Wadleigh remained in reserve until she was reactivated during the 

Korean War
. On 3 October 1951, Wadleigh was recommissioned at San Diego, Comdr. R. H. Pauli in command.


She departed San Diego on 4 January 1952, bound for duty with the 
Atlantic Fleet. She transited the 
Panama Canal on 14 January in company with 
Hazelwood'', 
Heermann'', 
Cassin Young'', and 
Cowell'' and, upon arrival at her new home port of 


Newport, Rhode Island

, became 
flagship for Destroyer Division 342.


After participating in various Fleet exercises, Wadleigh arrived at 

Pensacola, Florida
, on 17 August, to commence four weeks of plane-guard duty for 
Cabot''. She rescued three downed aviators from the 


Gulf of Mexico

 during this tour. Next, the destroyer sailed north for an overhaul at the 
Boston Naval Shipyard during which time the ship received a battery of 3 inch guns replacing the older 40-millimeter mounts.


On 3 May 1954, Wadleigh departed Newport, bound via the Panama Canal, Pearl Harbor, 








Midway







, and Guam for the 
Western Pacific (WestPac), and arrived at 
Yokosuka, Japan, on 7 June 1954. After initially operating in the Philippine Islands, the destroyer shifted to the waters off the east coast of 

Korea
, assisting in the supervision of 
Korean armistice agreements reached at 
Panmunjom the year before.


While in 


Subic Bay

, Wadleigh was put on alert and ordered to rendezvous with Task Group 70.2 (TG 70.2). Once she joined with the group, TG 70.2 proceeded to the southern coast of 

Formosa
 in a precautionary move by the United States to forestall possible Chinese communist intentions towards the American-supported Nationalist Chinese regime on the island. While en route to Formosa, the ship struck an underwater object which inflicted minor damage to both screws. Returning to Subic Bay, the ship repaired the damage and sailed to rejoin the group. Once back on station, she spent 20 tense but uneventful days on patrol off Formosa and, soon thereafter, proceeded back to 
Sasebo, Japan, to prepare to return to the United States.


Wadleigh returned to Newport via 

Hong Kong
, 

Singapore
, 

Colombo
, and various Mediterranean ports  and arrived at her home port on 28 November 1954. Shifting to the Caribbean, she operated both in these waters and off the east coast, on 
antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and local operations, through the end of 1955. She then deployed three times to the Mediterranean.


During the third of these deployments, in July 1958, tensions flared in 

Lebanon
, and civil strife threatened American lives and property. Accordingly, the United States landed troops to restore order. Wadleigh was among the first American ships to arrive on the scene, with another much-decorated Fletcher-class destroyer, 
The Sullivans'', arriving simultaneously. During the Lebanese crisis, she conducted eastern Mediterranean patrols as a unit of TF 61.


She returned to the east coast soon thereafter to operate along the Atlantic seaboard and into the Caribbean through the fall of 1958 before deploying to the Mediterranean for a fourth time in June 1959. While homeward-bound to Newport in September of that year, she served as one of the chain of ships beneath the aerial route of President 



Dwight D. Eisenhower


's return to the United States after his summit conferences in Europe.


During the period in which the ship continued to be based out of Newport, she conducted ASW exercises and local operations through the end of the year and into 1960. On 19 March 1960, Wadleigh sped to the scene of a collision between 
Darby'' and a 







Swedish






 tanker off 



Cape Henry


. Commander, 
Destroyer Squadron 20 (DesRon 20), embarked in Wadleigh, was on-scene commander and directed the successful effort to take Darby under tow.


Returning to a schedule of local operations, Wadleigh conducted a 
midshipman's training cruise, ASW patrols, and exercises. During a deployment to European waters in the fall of 1960, she conducted 

NATO
 fall exercises in the 

North Sea
 and across the 




Arctic Circle



.


Deploying to the Mediterranean for the fifth time, Wadleigh transited the 
Suez Canal and participated in 
CENTO 
Exercise Midlink III, in which the naval forces of five nations participated. In November 1960, the ship returned to Mediterranean and western European waters, and took part in ASW Exercises  Hay-strike  and  Jetstream  with 
French Navy units before returning to Newport on 15 December 1960.


She then conducted ASW exercises out of 

Mayport, Florida
, and practiced recovery techniques for participation in 
Project Mercury, the first American manned spaceflight program. Attached to TG 140.8, Wadleigh was on station on 5 May 1961 when Comdr. 


Alan Shepard

 conducted his history-making flight. A second participation by Wadleigh in the Project Mercury program came in August of that year, but unfavorable weather  scrubbed  the launch, and the destroyer was detached to return to Newport.


Late in the following fall, Wadleigh sailed for European waters once more and participated in 
Exercise Line Jug II extensive ASW exercises with 




Royal Navy



 units. She topped this deployment with visits to ports in the 

British Isles
 like 
Londonderry and 

Southampton
 before returning to her home port on 22 February 1962. She conducted routine local operations until departing Newport on 22 June for 


Norfolk, Virginia

 There, the ship was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 28 June 1962.


Wadleigh received six 
battle stars for her service in World War II.




 Blanco Encalada 



Wadleigh was transferred to 










Chile









 under the 
Military Aid Program in 1963. The ship was renamed Blanco Encalada and was given identification number 14. 


She was stricken and scraped in 1983.

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi





Tushar Arun Gandhi (           ) (born 
17 January 
1960 near 

Mumbai
, 

India
) is a great-grandson of 
Mahatma Gandhi, and the son of journalist 







Arun Manilal Gandhi






.


Born on a train between Mumbai and 

Kolkata
, he was raised in the Mumbai suburb of Santa Cruz. He holds a degree in painting from 






Mithibai College





.1


In December 2001 he negotiated with American marketing firm CMG Worldwide to use the Mahatma s image in an advertisement for a credit card company. The public outcry forced him to cancel the deal.2


In his book Let s Kill Gandhi, he blames 
Brahmins for assassinating Mahatma. Critics have claimed that the book defames all Brahmins. Gandhi has stressed that his claims relate only to  a certain group of Brahmins from Pune [who] were continuously attempting on the life of my great grandfather  rather than to Brahmins in general.3


In March 2005, he led the 75th anniversary re-enactment of the 
Dandi March. 


In 2006, he was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador4 of the Intergovernmental Institution for the use of Micro-algae Spirulina Against Malnutrition, IIMSAM that strives and advocates to make 
Spirulina a key driver to eradicate malnutrition,achieve food security and to bridge the health divide with special priority for the developing and the least developed countries.


Gandhi lives in 

Mumbai
 with his wife and two children, and runs the 

Mahatma Gandhi Foundation

 I wish they could understand I am a descendant of the Mahatma, not Mahatma myself. If being Mahatma was hereditary, there would be 54 living Mahatmas today! 5

Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo

Italian American history
Religious organizations established in 1887
Roman Catholic missionary orders




The Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo or Scalabrinian Missionaries are a 






Roman Catholic religious order





 of brothers and priests founded by 
Giovanni Battista Scalabrini, 
Bishop of Piacenza in 



Italy


, in 1887. Its mission is to  maintain 


Catholic

 faith and practice among Italian emigrants in the 






New World





.  Today, they and their sister organizations, the 
Missionary Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo (founded by Scalabrini on 
25 October 
1895) and 
Secular Institute of the Scalabrinian Missionary Women (founded 
25 July 
1961) minister to migrants, 
refugees and displaced persons.


History


The order was approved in principle by 







Pope






 
Leo XIII in a Brief dated 
25 November 
1887 and its constitution definitively approved by a decree of the 
Sacred Congregation of Propaganda on 
3 October 
1908. 


The expediency of providing for the spiritual   and also, in some degree, for the temporal   needs of Italian emigrants to 
the Americas was forcibly brought home to Bishop Scalabrini by the pathetic spectacle of a number of such emigrants waiting in the great railway station of 

Milan
. Acting upon this inspiration, and encouraged by Cardinal Simeoni, then 
Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda, the bishop acquired at Piacenza a residence which he converted into  The Christopher Columbus Apostolic Institution,  forming there a community of priests which was to be the nucleus of a new congregation. 


This congregation, which was henceforth to be known as the Missionaries of St. 

Charles Borromeo
, was to be governed by a superior-general, dependent upon the Congregation of Propaganda. Its primary aim was to maintain Catholic faith and practice among Italian emigrants in the New World, and  to ensure as far as possible their moral, civil, and economical welfare.  It was to provide priests for the emigrants, as well as committees of persons who should give the good advice and practical direction needed by poor Italians newly arrived in foreign ports; to establish churches, schools, and missionary homes in the various Italian colonies in 



North


 and 



South America


; and to train youths for the priesthood. The members of the congregation promise obedience to their superiors in the congregation and the ecclesiastical hierarchy. 


Seven priests and three lay brothers of Bishop Scalabrini's institute left Italy, on 
12 July 
1888, of whom two priests and one lay brother were bound for 





New York




, five priests and two lay brothers for various parts of 

Brazil
. On this occasion, 
Cesare Cantu, the famous Italian historian, addressed to the Bishop of Piacenza some memorable words of congratulation, asking leave to add to the bishop's blessing on the departing missionaries,  the prayers of an old man who admires a courage and an abnegation so full of humility.  A welcome had already been assured these first missionaries of the congregation by a commendatory letter (
1 June 
1888) of Leo XIII addressed to the American bishops. 


Immediately after their arrival in New York, the new missionaries were enabled to secure a favorable site in Centre Street, where there was a colony of Italians, and in a short time a chapel was opened; soon after this the church of the Resurrection was opened in Mulberry Street; lastly, a building in Roosevelt Street, which had been a 
Protestant place of worship, became the property of the mission fathers who transformed it into the church of St. Joachim, the first specially Italian church in the 

Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York
. The 
Society of St. Raphael, an emigrant aid society, was organized at 







Ellis Island






. The good work thereafter spread rapidly through the continent.

The Canada Life Building is an historic office building in 

Toronto
, 

Ontario
, 

Canada
.  The fifteen-floor 


Beaux Arts

 building was built by Sprott   Rolph and stands at 285 feet (87.0 m), 321 feet (97.8m) with 
weather beacon).


It is located at 





University




 and 










Queen Street









 in the city's downtown. Work on the new headquarters of the 
Canada Life Assurance Company began in 1929 and it opened in 1931. It was the fourth building to serve as the headquarters of Canada Life, Canada's oldest and at the time largest insurance company. Previously it had been housed in offices at Bay and King.


The 


Beaux Arts

 structure was the first of a series of planned structures along 





University Avenue




, but the Depression halted these plans. When it was completed it was one of the tallest buildings in Toronto. It remains one of the largest office buildings in Toronto with windows that can be opened by the occupants.



Weather beacon



The building is perhaps best known for its 
weather beacon, installed on 
August 9, 
1951.  The beacon shines red for rain, white for snow, and lights running up or down it indicate a change in temperature.


The beacon's colour-coded translations of weather information provide onlookers with  predictions at a glance .  The information is updated four times daily, seven days a week, by 

Environment Canada
's Weather Centre at 
Pearson International Airport.


The device uses a simple two-signal approach to illustrate the city's weather forecast.  A colourful beacon light located at the top of the tower forecasts approaching weather systems, while the second signal, displayed by the lights that are affixed to the support tower, indicates variations in temperature.


The beacon was the first of its kind to appear in Canada and was built at a cost of $25,000.  The top of the beacon tower stands 321 feet (98 m) above University Avenue and, upon completion, measured third only to the Royal York Hotel and the 476-foot, 34-storey Canadian Bank of Commerce (the tallest building in the British Commonwealth until 1962) as the tallest building peak in Toronto.

Digital Storytelling refers to using new digital tools to help ordinary people to tell their own real-life stories.


An emerging term



 Digital Storytelling  is an emerging term, one that arises from a 
grassroots movement that uses new digital tools to help ordinary people tell their own 'true stories' in a compelling and emotionally engaging form. These stories usually take the form of a relatively short story (less than 8 minutes) and can involve interactivity.


The term can also be a broader journalistic reference to the variety of emergent new forms of digital narratives (web-based stories, 
interactive stories, hypertexts, and narrative 
computer games).


As an emerging area of creative work, the definition of digital storytelling is still the subject of much debate.




Development and pioneers



The broad definition has been used by innumerable artists and producers to link their practices with traditions of oral storytelling and often to delineate work from the highly produced commercial or conceptual projects by focusing on authorship and humanistic or emotionally provocative content. Some of the artists that have self-described as digital storytellers included Abbe Don, 









Brenda Laurel








, Bernajean Porter, Dana Atchley, and 






Pedro Meyer





.


The short narrated films definition of digital storytelling relates back to the development of a production workshop by Dana Atchley at the 



American Film Institute


 in 1993 that was adapted and refined by Joe Lambert in the mid-1990's into a method of training promoted by the San Francisco Bay Area-based 
Center for Digital Storytelling.


Typically, digital stories are produced in intensive workshops. The product is a 2-5 minute film that combines a narrated piece of personal writing, photographic and other still images, and a musical soundtrack. The philosophy behind this type of digital storytelling is one of using technology to enable those without a technical background to produce works that tell a story using  moving  images and sound. The lower machine requirements for using stills rather than video, and the ease of use of iMovie with the so-called  Ken Burns  pan effect, allowed for the creation of films by non-techies.


Digital storytelling is evolving from the simple narrated video to forms with interactivity and higher production values. These include websites and online videos created to promote causes, entertain, educate, and inform audiences.




Use by public broadcasters and education



This model has been integrated into 
public broadcasting by the 
BBC'sCapture Wales project. The following year a similar project was launched by the BBC in England called Telling Lives. 


The Center for Digital Storytelling model has also been adopted in 
education, especially in the US, where some practitioners use it as a method of building engagement and 
multimedia literacy.  For example, the Bay Area Video Coalition 
http://www.bavc.org/ employs digital storytelling as a means of engaging and empowering at-risk youth.


Faculty and graduate students at the University of Houston have created a website called the Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling 
http://coe.uh.edu/digitalstorytelling/ which focuses on the use of Digital Storytelling by teachers and their students across multiple content areas and grade levels. 




Ball State University
 has a masters program in Digital Storytelling, as does the University of Oslo 
http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imk/MEVIT4130/index.xml.

Fortrose


Fortrose



Map of 
the Catlins showing location of Fortrose.




Fortrose is a locality on the southernmost coast of the 

South Island
 of 









New Zealand








 in the 
Southland region.1  It is situated on 
Toetoes Bay at the mouth of the 



Mataura River


, and is on the far western edge of 
the Catlins.  Nearby settlements include 
Otara to the southeast, 








Pukewao







 and 








Tokanui







 to the northeast, and 








Titiroa







 and 








Waimahaka







 to the north.



 History 



From 1834 to 1836, whalers lived at a station in the Fortrose area, and the first surveys for a town - slightly to the west of Fortrose's present location - gave it the name of Russelltown.  In the mid-19th century, Fortrose acquired its current name, a tribute to 
Fortrose in 

Scotland
, from a Scottish 
drover.  Its location at the Mataura's mouth meant it developed as a port to service the local region, and in 1875, a 200-foot (61 m) long jetty was built.  However, Fortrose's economy declined after the 




Tokanui Branch



 
railway was opened to Waimahaka in 1899 and then Tokanui in 1911, as the railway provided much quicker transportation for freight to 

Invercargill
.2


A number of Fortrose residents fought overseas in 

World War I
 and 







World War II






.  Six were killed in the former and two in the latter.  A round obelisk stands in Fortrose as a memorial to the deceased; it was unveiled in 1922 in honour of the World War I victims, with the names of the World War II casualties added later.3




 Economy 



In the 19th century, goods such as grain, logs, and wool were significant in the local economy.2  After its early 20th century decline, it is now reviving somewhat as 'The Gateway to 
the Catlins'.

Order of the House of Orange




The Order of the House of Orange (Dutch: Huisorde van Oranje), sometimes also named House Order of Orange, is a 






dynastic order





 of the 
House of Orange 
aka the 



Dutch


 Royal 
House of Orange-Nassau. The order was instituted by 
Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1905 and is not subject to ministerial responsibility or influence, but is awarded at the discretion of the Dutch monarch alone.


History


In 1905, Queen Wilhelmina felt the need for a House Order because the 






Order of the Oak Crown





 of the 
Grand Duchy of 

Luxembourg
, used by her father and grandfather to reward Dutch subjects, was no longer available to her, as females were not allowed to succeed the throne of Luxembourg due to the 
Salic Law within its constitution in 1890.


The Order of the House of Orange had a very complex 
nomenclature, with 18 different classes and medals:





Grand Cross


Grand Officer


Commander


Officer


Knight


Knight 2nd. Class (since 1908)


The Golden Medal for Art and Science (equal in rank to a Grand Officer and very rare)


The Golden Medal for Initiative and Ingenuity (since 1917, equal in rank to a Grand Officer and very rare)


The Silver Medal for Art and Science (equal in rank to an Officer and rare)


The Silver Medal for Initiative and Ingenuity (since 1917, equal in rank to an Officer and rare)


Dame of Honour


Golden Cross of Merit


Silver Cross of Merit


Golden Medal of Honour


Silver Medal of Honour


Bronze Medal of Honour


Medal for saving lives from deadly peril (since 1910)


The Bronze Medal for Art and Science. (equal in rank to a knight and rare)




The number does not indicate a rank within the Order. The Dame of Honour was neither inferior or superior to another grade; however the highest rank was the Grand Cross. The insignia vary considerably amongst these awards; however they all share the same orange ribbon, symbolizing the 
House of Orange.


More than 3200 decorations were conferred between 1905 and 1969, mostly to Court Dignitaries, the Queen's household, and doctors and lawyers who could choose between sending a bill for their services or a decoration in the House Order. In 1969, 
Queen Juliana decided to reorganise the Order to bring it more in line with the ever more egalitarian spirit of the Dutch society. As a result the old House Order was split into five groups:





The Order of the House of Orange



The Order for Loyalty and Merit



The medals for Art and Science



The medals for Initiative and Ingenuity









The Order of the Crown










House Order of Orange(knight's cross)

Order for Loyalty and Merit(knight's cross)

Order of the Crown(knight's cross)




















The House Order today


Today the Order of the House of Orange has these grades:





Grand Cross


Grand Cross of Honour


Cross of Honour




Every subject of the Queen, apart from the members of the Royal House (see note), can be awarded the Cross of Honour. Once awarded, the recipient can be promoted to a higher grade of the House Order after three years.


Note: The Royal House (Koninklijk Huis) is a rather vague definition within Dutch constitutional theory and Dutch law. It consists of the Monarch, his or her consort, former monarchs and their consorts and those members of her family that have a right to succeed her. The Government is responsible for the actions and words of the members of the Royal House. It is not the same as the Royal Household, although that calls itself, and is usually called the Royal House as well. The Queen's second son decided not to ask for parliamentary approval for his marriage and lost his right to succeed to the throne, his membership of the Royal House and the title Prince of the Netherlands. He did however remain a Royal Highness ,a Prince of Orange-Nassau and a member of the Royal Family.In the eyes of the genealogy and heraldry the words Royal House apply to various descendants of the Dutch monarch. The law on funerals does not apply to funerals of the members of the Royal House, but in this context membership will probably be defined in yet another way.

Plot


The movie begins immediately after Bourne apologizes to Irena Neski, daughter of Vladimir Neski, who was Bourne's first target. Wounded from 

The Bourne Supremacy
 car chase, Jason Bourne is still evading the 

Moscow
 police. Cornered by two officers while breaking into a medical clinic to treat his wounds, Bourne overpowers the officers, knocking one out, while holding the second at gunpoint.  He leaves them alive as he escapes.


Six weeks later, Simon Ross, a security correspondent for 

The Guardian
, meets with Neal Daniels, the Madrid CIA station chief, in 









Turin








, to discuss Treadstone. Bourne goes to 

Paris
 to tell Marie's brother, Martin, of her death, then heads to London. Bourne arranges to meet Ross in London at the south entrance of 
Waterloo Station. Ross, however, is under surveillance because his use of the word  Operation 
Blackbriar  in a phone call to his editor was tracked by 
ECHELON, alerting the CIA. CIA section chief Noah Vosen alerts his staff to find out any information on Ross, believing that Operation Blackbriar has been compromised.


After receiving a call from Bourne, Ross takes a taxi to Waterloo Station. At the station, Bourne sees CIA officers following Ross and places a prepaid mobile phone on him; through it, Bourne instructs him how to dodge the station's surveillance. However, Vosen orders an assassin, Paz, to kill Ross and his source. Vosen's team identifies Bourne on a security camera and recognizes him as the original Treadstone assassin, and assumes he is Ross's source. While Paz gets into position with a sniper rifle, Bourne tells Ross to remain hidden, but Ross panics and steps out into the open, giving Paz a clear kill shot. In the chaos, Bourne grabs Ross's notes which reveal Ross' source as Daniels.



Deputy Director Pamela Landy is asked to help capture Bourne. With Landy's help, Vosen and his team determine that Daniels is Ross' source. They send a team to Daniels' office in 

Madrid
, but Bourne arrives first, finding one photograph in an otherwise empty safe as Daniels has already left. Bourne attacks the CIA team members when they enter the office.  Right after Bourne secures the room, Nicky Parsons then enters it unexpectedly. Nicky tells him that she was reassigned to Madrid after Berlin, and that Daniels has fled to 

Tangier
. She helps him escape the CIA reinforcements by telling Vosen that Bourne had already left the office. While in Tangier, they realize the CIA has sent assassin Desh Bouksani to eliminate Daniels. Nicky uses her official clearance access to send Desh a message, telling him to meet her for a new phone, thus allowing Bourne to follow Desh to his target. When Vosen realizes Nicky's deceit he orders Desh to kill Nicky and Bourne after terminating Daniels. Landy is outraged at Vosen's willingness to indiscriminately kill CIA personnel and quits the operation.


Bourne follows Desh and is unable to save Daniels, who dies from Desh's planted bomb. When Desh returns for Nicky, Bourne outruns the Tangier police and fights Desh, eventually strangling him with a towel. Bourne has Nicky code in the fact that the both of them are dead to give each of them a head start at disappearing.  Bourne then puts Nicky on a bus with the advice that,  It gets easier.   (Referring to blending in and disappearing.)At the Tangier morgue, Bourne examines Daniels' charred papers and finds the address of the CIA substation in New York City. Bourne takes a flight to New York City, and on arrival deliberately uses a passport that alerts Landy to his presence. Bourne calls Landy while observing her and Vosen from across the street. Bourne sends a text message to Landy to arrange a meeting. Vosen and his team intercept the message and follow Landy as she leaves the building. However, the meeting is simply a diversion to allow him to enter Vosen's office and steal classified Blackbriar documents.


Vosen recognizes the diversion too late after receiving a phone call from Bourne to get a recording of his voice, which is one of the keys to unlocking his Blackbriar safe. Bourne states he is in Vosen's office, and Vosen frantically orders CIA officers back to his office to capture Bourne. Bourne escapes and enters into a car chase with CIA officers and Paz. Just outside the Treadstone facility, Bourne meets Landy and gives her the stolen documents from Vosen's office before entering the building. Inside, he meets Dr. Albert Hirsch, On his way back his office, Vosen eventually works out that Landy gave Bourne an address in code when Landy gave Bourne his date of birth. Vosen races to the facility where Landy finishes faxing away the Blackbriar document that Bourne stole. She looks at Vosen and says,  You better get yourself a good lawyer.   Inside, he meets Dr. Albert Hirsch, who ran Treadstone's psychological conditioning program. With his help, Bourne remembers that, as Captain David Webb, he volunteered for the program and killed a man in the same room. Horrified by the memory of what he did to complete his conditioning and to assume the Jason Bourne identity, he tells Hirsch,  I remember everything. I'm no longer Jason Bourne. 


Paz holds Bourne at gunpoint and demands to know why Bourne spared his life.  Do you even know why you have to kill me?....Look at us. Look at what they make you give,  says Bourne, repeating the dying words of the Treadstone assassin called The Professor from 

The Bourne Identity
. Paz lowers his weapon, but Vosen appears and fires at Bourne just as he jumps from the roof into the East River below.


Some time later, Nicky sees a news report noting the exposure of Blackbriar, the arrests of Hirsch and Vosen, that Ezra Kramer is the subject of a 

United States Senate
 hearing regarding his conduct, and that David Webb was shot and fell into the 
East River but his body was not recovered. In the final moments of the film we see Bourne swimming in the East River escaping his captors.

References to previous films



Within the series


In the 
audio commentary for the current 

DVD
 release of The Bourne Ultimatum, 
director 


Paul Greengrass

 confirmed the following scenes were deliberate allusions to scenes from the previous installments of the Bourne film franchise.5 They include:



The opening chase sequence of The Bourne Ultimatum is a continuation of the Russian police attempts to capture Bourne in Moscow near the end of 

The Bourne Supremacy
 and takes place immediately following Bourne's apology to Neski's daughter in the previous film.


The scene where Bourne tells Martin of his sister Marie's death is very similar to the ending of The Bourne Supremacy, when Bourne apologizes to the Neskis' daughter for killing her parents.


After Bourne tells Nicky she will have to run, Nicky dyes and cuts her hair, similar to the scene in The Bourne Identity with Marie dying and cutting her hair.


During the car chase with Paz, Bourne's car is destroyed in a similar fashion to Kirill's in the climax of The Bourne Supremacy. The sequence also includes similar staging, such as Bourne walking up to Paz with gun in hand but deciding not to shoot.


In the rooftop climax, Bourne tells Paz,  Look at us. Look at what they make you give,  reiterating the dying words of The Professor (

Clive Owen
) in 

The Bourne Identity
.


The ending of The Bourne Ultimatum, with Bourne floating motionless in the East River, echoes the opening scene of The Bourne Identity, which utilizes a similar image.






Outside of the series





The scene featuring Bourne desperately trying to catch a glimpse of Paz after Ross is gunned down is, according to Greengrass, a  wink  to one of his favorite films, 

The French Connection
.6


The scenes set in Tangiers echo the famous  cafe  scene from the film 

The Battle of Algiers
.








Music





Main article: 


As with the previous films in the trilogy, the score was composed by

. A new version of Moby's  Extreme Ways , entitled  Extreme Ways (Bourne's Ultimatum) , was recorded for the film's end credits.

Reception



The Bourne Ultimatum earned $69.2 million during its opening weekend at the box office, a record for a single opening in August14 and $441.2 million worldwide as of December 14, 2007.15 As of September 2008, the film has a 93% fresh rating (202 out of 217 positive reviews) at 

Rotten Tomatoes
,14 higher than either predecessor.1617 The film had a rating of 85/100 on 

Metacritic
, again higher than the first two films.18 At the end of its theatrical release, the film grossed at total of $227,471,070 in the U.S., making it the highest grossing film in the series.


Like its predecessor, 

The Bourne Supremacy
, the film was criticized for its 
shaky camera work, as 













Richard Corliss












 of 
Time magazine, in an otherwise positive review, wondered  why, in the chat scenes, the camera is afflicted with 
Parkinson's? The film frame trembles, obscures the speaker with the listener's shoulder, annoys viewers and distracts them from the content of the scene. 19


In the British press, the inclusion of a fictional journalist from the real British paper 

The Guardian
 and scenes set in the 











United Kingdom










 (particularly 
Waterloo railway station) were commented upon. In particular, that newspaper's reviewer noted that  dodging bullets from a CIA sniper... is the sort of thing which happens to us Guardian journalists all the time. 20212223

Sequel


In May 2007, prior to the release of Bourne Ultimatum, Matt Damon claimed that he would not be interested in returning for a fourth Bourne film, stating (of his participation in the Bourne franchise):  We have ridden that horse as far as we can. 28 Damon even said in an interview that director Paul Greengrass joked that a fourth film could be titled  The Bourne Redundancy. 29 Nonetheless, the financial and critical success of Bourne Ultimatum has led to speculation in several magazines and Internet forums that another Bourne film might be produced. On February 22, 2008, 










Variety









 reported that a fourth film was indeed in the works, with both Damon and Greengrass on board.30


However, on March 9, 2008, Damon and Greengrass claimed they had not agreed to another Bourne film.31 Damon stated  There are a lot of things that would have to happen before we would sign up for it. 31 On June 25, 2008, producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley said in an interview to IESB.net there would be a fourth Bourne film. Marshall said  Hopefully they will be shooting next summer for a release in 2010 and our favorite anti-hero is apparently headed to South America. 32

Punk pathetique is a 
subgenre of 











British










 
punk rock (principally active circa 1980-1982) that involved humour and 
working class cultural themes.1 


The name of the genre was coined by then-










Sounds









 journalist 












Garry Bushell











, who actively championed many of its exponents. Punk pathetique was initially an attempt to characterize a group of 

London
 bands that embodied 
Cockney culture with a 
Dickensian working class attitude. Musically it was related to, and had crossover with the 

Oi!
 subgenre. The cover of the 1980 Bushell/Sounds 
compilation album Oi the Album described the record as featuring  ruck 'n' rollers and punk pathetiques .2 In contrast to harder-edged Oi! bands with more serious lyrics, punk pathetique bands focused on the naughty, silly and trivial. Max Splodge, of Splodgenessabounds, said:  The pathetique bands are the other side of Oi! We're working class too, only whereas some bands sing about prison and the dole, we sing about 
pilchards and bums. The audience is the same. 1


Some punk pathetique bands had notable successes in the UK charts. 

Toy Dolls
 got to #4 in December 1984 with  Nellie The Elephant.  

Splodgenessabounds
 reached #7 in 1980 with  Simon Templar , and #26 with  Two Little Boys  later that year. According to Bushell:
During 1980, hooligan audiences, especially in South East London, found new live laughs in the shape of Peckham-based piss-artist pranksters Splodgenessabounds, whose brand of coarse comedy and punk energy scored three top thirty singles that year. Their debut single,  
Two Pints of Lager  was a Top Ten smash. Tongue in cheek, I dubbed them  punk pathetique  along with equally crazy bands like Brighton's 
Peter and the Test Tube Babies and Maccam jesters The 

Toy Dolls
.1



Peter and the Test Tube Babies were first featured in Sounds in July 1980, and made their vinyl debut on Oi! The Album later that year. They favoured absurd lyrics and strange titles, such as  The Queen Gives Good Blow Jobs. 3 Toy Dolls, based in 

Sunderland
, shared the punk pathetique approach to nonsensical entertainment. Toy Dolls singer Olga Algar told Sounds in March 1980:  We're a new wave group, but we're not serious. All our songs are pretty childish and infantile, but they're all based on things and people 'round here. 4 


Bushell wrote that punk pathetique peaked in autumn 1980, with the Pathetique Convention staged at the 








Electric Ballroom







.1 However, music critic Dave Thompson has stated of Splodgenessabounds' 1981 album:
Music historians find their attention drawn to  We're Pathetique , Splodge's rallying call for a musical genre which precious few people even remember today. But the Punk Pathetique movement spawned not only Splodge, but also such joys as the Toy Dolls and Peter and the Test Tube Babies, and it still has an impact today.5


Other punk pathetique bands included 
TV Personalities, 
The Shapes, 

The Adicts
, the Notsensibles, the Gonads, The Postmen, Desert Island Joe, The Hoopers, Pierre The Poet (Garry Butterfield), Paul Devine, Lord Waistrel   The Cosh Boys, Stephen Louis Knoche Jr   his Raging Cronies, the Alaska Cowboys, and the Orgasm Guerrillas. Later, the mantle was inherited by the 



Bus Station Loonies


 and the 

Macc Lads
, who did comic punk singalongs in very much the same style. As of 2006, Toy Dolls, Peter and the Test Tube Babies, The Gonads and Splodgenessabounds continued to tour and record.

Dr Peter Howard Toyne (born 
1946) is a former 

Australia
n politician. He was an 

Australian Labor Party
 member of the 

Northern Territory Legislative Assembly
 from 
1996 to 
2006, representing the rural electorate of 



Stuart


. He served as Attorney-General under 

Chief Minister
 


Clare Martin

, and for some years was occasionally tipped as a potential successor to Martin. He resigned from the ministry and from parliament in 
August 2006, citing health reasons.


Toyne was born and raised in 
Victoria. He initially spent time as a professional athlete, twice coming third in the 






Stawell Gift





, winning five Victorian championships over 400 and 800 metres, and breaking world records over 550 metres and 600 yards. However, he later studied science and education at the 

University of Melbourne
 with the intent of becoming a teacher. He graduated in 
1972, and spent several years teaching at 
Flemington High School. In 
1976, Toyne founded the 
Kensington Community School, and spent four years working on the project. 


Toyne left the 

Melbourne
 school in 
1980, and not long after, relocated across the country to the 





Northern Territory




. He took a particular interest in community education projects aimed at the indigenous community of the Territory, developing several programs and serving stints as both a teacher and an administrator. Toyne also worked as a consultant to the 





Perron




 government from 
1990 to 
1994.


Toyne began to take an interest in a political career, and when 

Australian Labor Party
 Opposition Leader 
Brian Ede resigned from parliament in mid-
1996, Toyne nominated to replace him as the ALP candidate for Stuart at the 
subsequent by-election. The campaign was a particularly close one, but Toyne was ultimately successful, defeating 

Country Liberal Party
 candidate Tony Bohning by only 72 votes. 


Having been elected, Toyne began serving as an opposition backbencher, and managed to survive another challenge from Bohning at the 
1997 election, which was won by only 70 votes. Two years later, Toyne was appointed as the party whip when 


Clare Martin

's ascendancy to the leadership sparked a cabinet reshuffle. By this point, Toyne was becoming an increasingly prominent figure in Northern Territory politics, and at the 
2001 election, was easily re-elected, winning more than 70% of the vote. When that same election saw the ALP win their first victory in the history of the Assembly, new Chief Minister 


Clare Martin

 appointed Toyne to the ministry, most notably as Attorney-General. Toyne received a further promotion when unpopular Health Minister 








Jane Aagaard







 was dumped in October 
2003, and he was called upon as her replacement. Though he had publicly speculated about resigning at the 
2005 election, he later announced that he would indeed re-contest the seat after being rebuked by Martin, and was easily re-elected for a third full term.


Barely a year after being re-elected, on 
August 29, 
2006, Toyne suddenly resigned from both the ministry and from parliament, citing an unnamed medical condition. A 
by-election was held, with Labor candidate 
Karl Hampton successful.


Toyne is married and has one son and one daughter.

The Commerzbank-Arena viewed from

.



The Waldstadion (official name:Commerzbank-Arena) is a 52,300 seat 
football 
stadium in 
Frankfurt, 

Germany
.  It is the home of 


Eintracht Frankfurt

 of the 
Bundesliga. The Waldstadion was first opened in 1925 and during 







World War II






 it was used for political events of the 
Nazi Party.

The stadium has been named  Commerzbank-Arena  since July 2005. But most people, especially the fans of Eintracht Frankfurt, still call it Waldstadion. During the 

2006 FIFA World Cup
, the stadium was called  FIFA WM Stadion Frankfurt  (in English,  FIFA World Cup Stadium Frankfurt ). Large modifications were made for the tournament with the stadium being nearly completely rebuilt and modernized. Now it is one of Germany's biggest stadiums  and there have already been some important events in 2005, such as the finale of the 

Confederations Cup
.


One modification involved suspending a large four-sided structure over the stadium with large screens on each side for the crowds to see. On sunny days this creates a large shadow on the pitch, making it more difficult to watch matches via television because the cameras have to adjust between the light dark areas of the pitch.  During the first match in the stadium of the 

2006 World Cup
 between 

England
 and 

Paraguay
, a goal kick from England goalkeeper 










Paul Robinson









 struck the video cube and bounced into play.


During the 

South Korea
 vs 

Togo
 match the roof was closed over the stadium, despite the weather being dry and sunny, presumably to shade the whole pitch and avoid the effects of the shadow. This decision was criticised by some because it meant the stadium became very hot and humid on an already hot and humid day.



 2006 FIFA World Cup 


The stadium was one of the venues for the

In August and September 2007, the Commerzbank-Arena temporarily served as the home ground of the newly promoted 
2nd Bundesliga side 


SV Wehen Wiesbaden

, because their new stadium, the 
Brita-Arena, was not ready to host matches until October. The club played four league matches in the stadium, staying undefeated as they won three times and drew once.


In 2008-09 the ground is also home ground of 



Bornheim


 based club 


FSV Frankfurt

 whose actual stadium 





Bornheimer Hang




 was not proved as suitable for the 2nd Bundesliga. Ironically the Bornheimer Hang was renovated for 3rd Liga's needs and now serves as home ground for  Eintracht Frankfurt's reserve team, 



Eintracht Frankfurt U23


.


The Commerzbank-Arena was also the home ground of 
NFL Europe's 



Frankfurt Galaxy


, and hosted three 
World Bowls. It hosted its third and final World Bowl on 
June 23, 
2007, when the Frankfurt Galaxy lost to the 



Hamburg Sea Devils


 in World Bowl XV.

Career


Pichot made his debut for Los Pumas in April 1995 during the Pumas' tour to Australia, scoring a 
try in the first Test in 

Brisbane
. Pichot was capped another three times that year for the Pumas; playing in Tests against Romania, Italy and France during October. The following year he was capped another three times for Argentina, playing two Tests against France and one against Uruguay in June, scoring a try in the match against Uruguay. In October/November of the next year he earned another four Test caps, playing in matches against Italy, France and the Wallabies, scoring a try in the second of two matches against the Wallabies. He moved from CASI to Richmond where he played alongside a legend of the game Richard Mclennan in the 1997-98 season, and would later switch to Bristol.


Pichot would be capped six times during the 1998 international season, including playing France three times, as well as playing matches against Italy, Romania and Wales, scoring tries in the games against Wales and Romania. In the lead up to the 








1999 Rugby World Cup







 in 
Wales Pichot played two Tests against the hosts in June, and Tests against Scotland and Ireland that August, scoring a try in the Test against Ireland. He played five matches during the World Cup, and helped the Pumas reach the quarter-finals. Argentina played France in their quarter-final, which France won 26-47, Pichot being one of Argentina's try scorers in the match.


After the World Cup Pichot captained Argentina for the first time in a Test against Ireland in June 2000, which Argentina won 34 points to 23. He was also capped another four times that year, playing two games against World Champions Australia and then matches against South Africa and England in November. He earned eight Test caps during 2001, and captained Argentina on three more occasions, in matches against Uruguay, the United States and Canada in May. He played six Tests the following year, captaining the Pumas during two of them (June Tests against England and South Africa).

Lighting




Xelogen is a 
gas which combines 
xenon and a 
halogen, such as 
chlorine or 
fluorine. The word is a 
portmanteau of xenon and halogen.

It is used in 
lighting, where it is put in 
incandescent light bulbs to make them last longer and burn a brighter 
white.  Unlike halogen-only bulbs, xelogen bulbs can be handled with bare 
hands and will not be damaged by being operated with 
fingerprints or other 
oils from the 
skin present on the exterior of the 
glass.  Xelogen bulbs also last longer than ones with only one or the other gas. Xelogen bulbs are not readily available to the public but instead are more cost effective for bulk purchases than xenon bulbs.

For other persons named Arthur Morgan, see 
Arthur Morgan (disambiguation).



Arthur Morgan (

Irish
: Artur O Muireagain; born 23 July 1954) is a 
Sinn Fein 
TD for 
Louth and is party spokesperson on the Environment, Local Government and Employment. 12


Arthur Morgan was born in 








Omeath







 in 

County Louth
. Educated locally, he joined the family fish processing company, of which he is currently a director.3  He is a founding member of Cooley Environmental and Health Action Committee which campaigns against 





Sellafield




 nuclear power station. 2


Morgan is a former 

Provisional Irish Republican Army
 prisoner. He was sentenced to 14 years in jail after being arrested on a boat on 

Carlingford Lough
 during an operation in 1977. 1 He served seven and a half years at 
Long Kesh prison, where he participated in the 
blanket protest, before being released in 1984. 3


In the 
1999 European Election Morgan polled over 20,000 votes in the 

Leinster constituency
 but failed to be elected.  He was however elected to 
Louth County Council on the same day for the Dundalk Carlingford area. In the 

2002 General Election
 he was elected to 
Dail Eireann as a 
Sinn Fein TD 2 and retained his seat in the 

2007 General Election
.


In a Dail debate on the budget on 6 March 2008, Morgan launched a strong attack on the government's economic policy, saying that  There is more social conscience in a cat s arse than there is in the entire Fianna Fail parliamentary party.  Condemning a Government proposal to give tax breaks for the development of private hospices, he asked  Why would I expect any different from a Tanaiste and a Government over this partial Parliament in this little semi-statelet over which he is presiding?  His remarks were criticised by 
Fianna Fail deputy 










Martin Mansergh









, who claimed that Sinn Fein  does not have any coherent economic policy that I am aware of  and said that he has  always had great difficulty understanding so called republicans who do not recognise this Republic .45 Deputy 





Michael Finneran




  added that  if it was not for him and his fellow travellers we would have had considerably more money to invest in many projects over the years instead of needing to spend it on security to protect the State. 45

.






Old and new trackless trolleys at 





Cambridge Common




.



There are currently four 
trolleybus routes in the 

Boston, Massachusetts
 area, all run by the 







Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority






 (MBTA) in the 











Harvard Square










 area, and all former 
streetcar lines (the last four not connected to the 







Tremont Street Subway






 to survive). The MBTA and its predecessors once ran a large system of trackless trolleys, but most have been replaced by buses; the four survived, in part, because of the necessity for left-hand doors in the 
Harvard Bus Tunnel. They are all stored overnight in the North Cambridge Carhouse, the northern terminus of the 77A. Trackless trolleys do not run on Saturday evenings and Sundays; instead conventional 
buses cover the routes.

In 2004, the MBTA began receiving a fleet of new trackless trolleys from 

Neoplan
, to replace older Flyer trolleybuses dating to the 1970s. The newer vehicles meet 
Americans with Disabilities Act standards (see 
MBTA accessibility).


Additionally, the 

Silver Line
 Phase II uses dual-mode buses and until early 2006 also used some of the new Neoplan trackless trolleys pending the entry of the entire dual-mode fleet into service.  As of July 2006, the Neoplan trackless trolleys have now all been transferred to the following routes, and most of the Flyer trolleybuses have been retired, with up to 10 (some sources say 12) being kept as spares.



71





New trackless trolley near 











Harvard Square










.



The 71 Watertown Square - Harvard Station via Mt. Auburn St. begins at the 
Harvard Bus Tunnel lower level and leaves via the south exit onto Mount Auburn Street. It heads west into 

Watertown
, ending at 
Watertown Square.


At the Harvard end, to turn around, the trolleybus exits the tunnel and makes a hard left onto Massachusetts Avenue and a right on Garden Street, and then turns right on Waterhouse Street and right on Massachusetts Avenue to return to the tunnel. The Watertown end has a loop on private 
right-of-way for turning around and picking up/dropping off passengers.



September 4, 
1958 was the last day of streetcar service on the 71 (and 73 and 77A), after which trackless trolleys have run.




72


The 72 Huron Ave. Harvard Station via Concord Ave. starts on the upper level and comes out the north end of the tunnel, using the path that the 71 uses to turn around. However, at the intersection of Garden and Waterhouse Streets, the 72 heads west on Garden Street, Concord Avenue and Huron Avenue and south on Aberdeen Avenue to end at Mount Auburn Street, intersecting the 71 and 73.


To turn around, the 72 leaves the south portal of the tunnel and turns left on Mount Auburn Street. It turns right on Eliot Street, right on Bennett Street and right on private 
right-of-way to go straight across Mount Auburn Street into the tunnel. At the west end, the 72 simply makes a 
U-turn across the wide 
median of Aderdeen Avenue. On Saturday evenings and Sundays, the 72 is combined with the 75 bus and the route extends to Belmont center.


Streetcars last ran on the 72 on 
April 1, 
1938, and trackless trolleys have been running since then.




73


The 73 Waverley Sq. Harvard Station via Trapelo Road follows the same route as the 71 in 

Cambridge
. It leaves Mt. Auburn St. to follow Belmont Street, which forms a border between 

Belmont
 and 

Watertown
, then continues on Trapelo Road in Belmont to end at Waverley Square, with a loop at the Waverley 




commuter rail



 station on the 




Fitchburg Line



. A short-turn loop exists at Benton Square, the intersection of Belmont Street and Trapelo Road. 
http://groups-beta.google.com/group/ne.transportation/browse_frm/thread/4fd85c1cf852ba2a/0ada1afb4350d150



September 4, 
1958 was the last day of streetcar service on the 73 (and 71 and 77A), after which trackless trolleys have run. As a streetcar line, the turnback loop was further west along Trapelo Road at Cushing Square. Streetcars first ran to Waverley Square on 
October 1, 
1898. 
http://groups-beta.google.com/group/ne.transportation/browse_frm/thread/4fd85c1cf852ba2a/0ada1afb4350d150
The old streetcar tracks can be seen at Waverley Square.




77A


The 77A is a short-turn trip of the 
77 Arlington Heights - Harvard Station via Massachusetts Ave. bus. It simply exits the north end of the tunnel onto Massachusetts Avenue, which it uses to the loop at the North Cambridge Carhouse. At the Harvard end, it turns around in the same way as the 72. However, these loops are not normally made, as since January 2005, the only 77A trips are pull-ins and pull-outs to take 71 and 73 buses to or from the carhouse. They are listed in 71 and 73 schedules.



September 4, 
1958 was the last day of streetcar service on the 77A (and 71 and 73), after which trackless trolleys have run. Until around 1967, the route was numbered 82.

Hans Georg Conon von der Gabelentz (
16 March 
1840 - 
11 December 
1893) was a 

German
 
general linguist and 
sinologist. His Chinesische Grammatik (1881), according to a critic,  remains until today recognized as probably the finest overall grammatical survey of the 

Classical Chinese
 language to date.  (Harbsmeier 1995:333)

Gabelentz was born in Poschwitz, near 

Altenburg
, 

Saxe-Altenburg
. His father was the more renowned minister and linguist 










Hans Conon von der Gabelentz









, an authority of the 

Manchu language
. Gabelentz taught himself Dutch, Italian and 

Chinese
 during his 





gymnasium




 years. 


From 1860 to 1864, following his father's steps, he studied law, administration, and linguistics at 

Jena
. In 1864 he entered the civil service of 






Saxony





 at 

Dresden
. He continued his study of oriental languages at 

Leipzig
. He married Alexandra von Rothkirch in 1872. His father Hans died at the family castle of 
Lemnitz in 1874. 


Gabelentz earned his doctoral from Dresden in 1876 with a translation of 






Zhou Dunyi





's Taiji Tushuo (      Explaining 
taiji ). In 1878, a Professorship of Far Eastern Languages, the first of its kind in the German-speaking world, was created at the 

University of Leipzig
, and Gabelentz was invited to fill it. In 1889, he divorced, and switched to the 
University of Berlin. In 1891, he remarried, and published Die Sprachwissenschaft ( Linguistics ).  His Handbuch zur Aufnahme fremder Sprachen followed one year later.

Joseph Gilbert Totten




Joseph Gilbert Totten (
August 23, 
1788   
April 22, 
1864) fought in the 

War of 1812
, served as 
Chief Engineer and was regent of the 




Smithsonian Institution



 and cofounder of the 






National Academy of Sciences





.



Early life and education


He was born in 

New Haven, Connecticut
 and graduated from the 

United States Military Academy
 and was commissioned in the 
Corps of Engineers on 
July 1, 
1805.   


He resigned in 1806 to assist his uncle, Major 
Jared Mansfield, who was then serving as Surveyor General of federal public lands.   




Military career


Totten re-entered the Corps of Engineers in 1808 and assisted in building 
Fort Williams and 





Fort Clinton




 in 

New York
 harbor.   


During the 

War of 1812
, he was Chief Engineer of the Niagara frontier and 

Lake Champlain
 armies under General 
Stephen Van Rensselaer.   He was 
brevetted lieutenant colonel for gallant conduct in the 
Battle of Plattsburg.   As a member of the first permanent Board of Engineers, 1816, he laid down durable principles of coast defense construction.   


From 1825 until 1838, Totten oversaw the construction of 

Fort Adams
 in 

Newport, Rhode Island
. Fort Adams was the second largest construction project attempted by the Army in the 19th Century exceeded only by Fort Monroe in Virginia. Totten employed recent graduates of West Point as assistant engineers at Fort Adams where they learned advanced engineering techniques. Totten's apprentices included 

John G. Barnard
, 
George W. Cullum, 
Pierre G. T. Beauregard and 
Alexander D. Bache all of whom earned distinction during the Civil War. While at Fort Adams, Totten conducted experiments with various mortar compositions and published a paper of his findings.


Totten was appointed 
Chief Engineer of the United States Army in 1838, and served in that position for 25 years until his death in 1864. As Chief Engineer he was intimately involved with every aspect of the Army Corps of Engineers activities from fortifications to harbor improvement.  Beginning in 1844, Totten was involved with the construction of 





Fort Montgomery




 on 

Lake Champlain
 in upstate New York. During this period, Totten also invented an iron reinforced 
embrasure for cannon which would better protect the gunners inside a fort, a design which he incorporated into Fort Montgomery.  


He was greatly admired by General 

Winfield Scott
, for whom he directed the 
siege of Veracruz as his Chief Engineer during the 
Mexican-American War. He later served as a 
Civil War 
Union Army general, being 
brevetted as a US Army Brigadier General in 1847 and receiving his permanent appointment in 1863.  


One of Totten's most significant achievements was the design and construction of the 
Minots Ledge lighthouse near 

Cohasset, Massachusetts
. Previous efforts to build a lighthouse on the small ledge of rock had failed but Totten conceived a plan whereby the lighthouse would be pinned by its own weight to the ledge making it able to withstand the harshest extremes of weather. It stands to this day flashing a distinctive 1-4-3 light pattern which has been interpreted to mean  I LOVE YOU .


Totten served most of his time as Chief Engineer in the rank of Colonel but was promoted to Brigadier General in 
March 3, 
1863.   He died of 
pneumonia in 

Washington, D.C.
 on 
April 22, 
1864 having served almost 60 years in the Army.


Totten was posthumously promoted to Brevet Major General and was buried in the 






Congressional Cemetery





 in Washington.




Namesakes


Several places have been named after General Totten, including: the Civil War 





Fort Totten




 built to defend the federal 

capital
-- while this fort no longer exists, the surrounding neighborhood and 

Metro station
 still bear the name-- as well as a 







fort in New York City






.

Salem Castle





Schule Schloss Salem (or Schule SchloS Salem, 





Anglicisation




: School of Salem Castle, Salem Castle School) is a boarding school with campuses in 
Salem and 
Uberlingen in 
Baden-Wurttemberg, Southern 

Germany
. It is considered as one of the most prestigious elite schools in 
Europe and is often attended by German and European nobility.


It offers the German 










Abitur









, as well as the 
International Baccalaureate (IB). With a scholarship program and its  Dienste  (Services) such as the Firebrigade, the  Technisches Hilfswerk  short: 
THW (Technical Support Organisation), the First Aid or the Nautical Service. The Schule Schloss Salem, also commonly referred to as Salem College, hence offers an education for its students at the academic as well as social levels.


The school was established by the educator 
Kurt Hahn with support of 


Prince Maximilian of Baden

 in 1920 and from the beginning accepted girls and boys. Hahn later emigrated to 

Scotland
 where he founded the 

British Salem School of Gordonstoun
 as well as later Outward Bound and the 

United World Colleges
.



The school today


The school s mission continues to reflect its Hahnian roots. Specifically, Salem aims to present young people with high academic and extracurricular expectations and opportunities; and to introduce them to a lifelong sense of respect for the individual, responsibility to the community and an awareness of the importance of the democratic process in sustaining both.


The academic program in Years 5-9 is in German. Intensive instruction in German as a foreign language is available for international pupils. Even pupils arriving at the School with no German are fluent within one school year. For international pupils already fluent in English there is an accelerated English program leading to the attainment of the British GCSE qualification.


From Year 10 onward, Salem is fully bilingual and offers a dual curriculum. Students may either continue in the German system (Abitur) or enter the Pre-IB   
IB Diploma Programme, in which the language is English. Approximately half of students in the upper years are in the IB system. Most students are of German background, but a significant minority of international students does exist, with students attending from a variety of countries such as Switzerland, USA, China, Russia, Korea, India, Canada, Australia or Italy.


At Salem, involvement in extracurricular activities and the life in the boarding community and academic achievement are equally emphasized. All students in the upper years must engage in community service such as Nautical Service, THW (Technical Support Organisation) extended First Aid or Firebrigade at least one afternoon per week. During the terrible Airplane accident of 2002 in Uberlingen, Salem Students were some of the first at the scene. All students must also participate in a regular program of sports and/or outdoor pursuits such as Outward Bound, Football, Rugby or Gymnastics. Participation in theatre, music and visual-arts extracurricular programs, while not mandatory, is strongly encouraged. The student orchestra in Salem is regarded to be one of the foremost youth-orchestra's in Germany and travels around the world to perform its music, such as a recent trip to Beijing, China.


Far more than in boarding schools from the Anglo-American tradition, responsibility for the everyday running of the School in the upper years is, in keeping with Salem s democratic ethos based on the principles of Kurt Hahn, placed in the hands of students under the guidance of staff. All activities and dormitories (Flugel) are led by students elected by their peers. School regulations are outlined with the consent of the student parliament and breaches of these are jointly dealt with by the School administration and the elected leaders of the student body in what is called the Leitungsrat or the 'Leadership Council', which comprises the Headmaster of the College, the two Head Boys/Girls, the students housemaster/mistress and other senior staff members.


Approximately one-third of pupils receive financial aid through various scholarship programmes, the distribution of which is based upon both need and merit. University admissions are excellent, with almost all graduates eventually attending the most selective universities in Germany, Great Britain and the leading Commonwealth countries, as well as the United States.



Spetzgart and Harlen







 Campuses 


Salem is divided into four separate campuses: the Lower School in Hohenfels Castle (grades 5 to 7), the Middle School in Salem Castle (grades 8 to 11, and Pre-IB), and the 'Upper' (secondary) School in Spetzgart Castle and the new campus of Harlen (Grades 12 and 13, IB years 1 and 2). Hohenfels is located in an isolated castle above the town of Kalkofen. Salem Castle is located in a former 
Cistercian monastery just outside the town of 
Salem, while the Upper School is located on the outskirts of 
Uberlingen in Spetzgart Castle and nearby the recently built Harlen campus.

Wo Hop Shek (

Chinese
:    ) is an area in the south of 
Fanling, 

Hong Kong
.  It consists of villages and recently developed housing estates.  The area is famous for its large public cemetery, 






Wo Hop Shek Public Cemetery





, on the nearby hillside.  Every year, during the 
Ching Ming Festival and 
Chung Yeung Festival, many people would come to visit their ancestors.


Railway


In 1950-1951, a 
Wo Hop Shek Branch (in fact only a long siding) of 

Kowloon-Canton Railway
 was built to transport bodies of 
civilians killed in 







World War II






, and later to cater the visitor in 
Ching Ming Festival and 
Chung Yeung Festival.  The whole 
single track branch was built upon an 
embankment. It branched off south of 
Fanling Station, at the start of the curve. The station at Wo Hop Shek was the most modern of all stations in Hong Kong at the time it was built, and instead of being a brick built structure as other stations were it was of cement and steel. Special vehicles were built to carry the bodies. The branch was abandoned after the railway was electrified in 1983. No traces can be found now of the line, but the site of the station survives as a roundabout. The start of the branch is now marked by a red gate visible on the Fanling side of the 
Jockey Club Road bridge, which used to be a level crossing.




Gallant Garden


In 1996, 






Gallant Garden





 (or Ho Yuen, in Chinese), in 






Wo Hop Shek Public Cemetery





, was established for the 
civil servants who die of injuries during their duty. In 2000, permanent earth burial was extended to both civil servants and non-civil servants who died of exceptional bravery on duty. There is also a big Buddhist-Taoist monastery built near the cemetery. There are many shops in the villages which makes stone graves.




Housing estates


They are mostly 
public housing estates built after 1983, as reflected on the fact that part of the original 
trackbed of the railway branch is occupied by two of the estates.

The Serial: A Year in the Life of Marin County (often referred to as The Serial) is  a 
satirical novel written by 





Cyra McFadden




 1. It was first published in book form in 
1977. Beginning in 
1976 the book's chapters had been 









serial








ized in a 

Marin County, California
 alternative newspaper, 

Pacific Sun
.

The book deals with life in the mid-1970s in Marin County, a suburban and affluent county just north of 

San Francisco
.


Perhaps because its subject matter is no longer the present or recent past, The Serial has been out of print for several years in the United States. It was reprinted in the United Kingdom by Prion Humour Classics in 2000. However, the book was popular at the time of its initial publication. 


A 

movie version
 of the book, called Serial, was based on the novel and starred 

Martin Mull
, 

Tuesday Weld
, and others. It received limited critical acclaim and limited box-office success.



Plot summary



The Serial is divided into 52 short chapters and it chronicles the lives, loves, and relationships of a number of residents, mostly in their mid-to-late 30s and early 40s, of Marin County, the suburban, generally affluent county directly across the 

Golden Gate Bridge
 from 

San Francisco
.  The plot revolves around Harvey and Kate Holroyd, a couple in the midst of the mid-1970s Marin lifestyle who are undergoing marital problems, although there are many other characters introduced and described throughout the novel.


There are elements of 
soap opera in the book, although the tone is comedic (specifically, satirical) rather than tragic.  The novel describes its characters' lifestyles, including their interest in various 
New Age beliefs and 
human potential movement groups (including 

est
, 
transcendental meditation, consciousness-raising, and 
rebirthing); their unconventional and arguably lax child-rearing techniques; and their embrace of a number of then-current fads, such as 
fern bars, 
jogging, and organic food.  The book satirizes many of the elements of a particular mid-to-late 1970s subculture, also described to some degree by author 


Tom Wolfe

 in his 1976 non-fiction essay  The Me Decade and the Third Great Awakening , particularly as manifested in the lives of people then between the ages of about 30 and 45 in affluent parts of 

California
. The book was said by some[] to satirize suburban California in the manner 



John Updike


 or 


John Cheever

 were satirizing Northeast suburbanites.


Many of the characters in The Serial also speak a particular jargon or lexicon, saying words and phrases like  flash on  (a 
phrasal verb meaning to  have a sudden insight about ),  Really  (to signify assent), and others.  


The Serial contains a great number of specific references to actual locations (restaurants, stores, streets) in 1970s Marin County.  In the original edition of the book, and in most if not all later editions, black-and-white illustrations  of scenes from the novel accompany the text in many of the chapters.




Reviews



The Serial is a comedy about moderns struggling to keep their chins above the rising sea of their status anxieties. It is a 
Baedeker guide to a desolate region, the monochromatic inner landscape of persons whose life is consumption, of goods and salvations, and whose moral makeup is the curious modern combination of hedonism and earnestness.


   Conservative essayist 
















George Will















, 1977 2

The 

British Rail
 Class 508 
electric multiple units ( EMUs ) were built by 



BREL


 at 

York
 works in 1979-80. They were the fourth variety of BR's then-standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs, eventually encompassing 755 vehicles and five classes (

313
/

314
/

315
/

507
/508). They have mostly worked on the 

Merseyrail
 network since 1983, and continue to do so, now refurbished by Alstom's 
Eastleigh Works.



Description


The Class 508 EMUs were developed for Merseyside following extensive trials and testing of the 
4Pep/2Pep stock built in the early 
1970s. Testing of 

Class 313
 stock took place in Merseyside, using 313003 and 313005. However, following planning and building, British Rail decided to divert the 508s to work alongside much older first-generation 4Sub EMUs in the London Waterloo area. Based at Strawberry Hill depot, they soon became very unpopular in the Southern region due to their being non-standard. Once a new build of 

Class 455
 EMUs were complete, the 508s were slowly sent to their originally intended home on the Merseyrail network, to work alongside the already well-established fleet of 

Class 507
 EMUs working there since 1978.


All 43 508s are now formed of three cars, although they were four-car sets on the Southern Region. When sent to Merseyside, one of the trailer cars was removed and incorporated into the 455/7 build of EMUs. Also the individual passenger door controls which had been a feature of these units were plated over before the units were sent north. Original plans were drawn up for 58 508s to be constructed, although costing issues limited the eventual number to 43. Carriage numbering is as follows:



64649-64691 - DMSO


71483-71525 - TSO


64692-64734 - BDMSO






Current operations


Merseyrail operate 27 508s, which are used interchangeably between the 
Northern Line and the 
Wirral Line.




Connex South Eastern
 leased 12 508s surplus to Merseyrail requirements (508101/105/106/107/109/113/116/119/121/129/132/133) in 1996, for operation on specific Kent services. This fleet is used due to lack of Networkers (466s), particularly on the Medway Valley Line and the Isle of Sheppey line. In September 2006 new operator 

Southeastern
 announced that a cascade of rolling stock would see 

Class 466s
 units replace the 508s on the Sheerness and Medway Valley lines in the December 2006 timetable. After this timetable change, there are now only six units left in 

Southeastern
 operation based at Gillingham Depot. 
http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/news.php?id=38 u=news.php There are 5 units in 'warm store' at Ashford Chart Leacon, and one unit 508212, is heavily robbed to keep the surviving service units in operation. It recently swapped its TSO coach with one from a service unit that ran into a tree on the Redhill-Tonbridge line.


Silverlink leased three 508s from Angel Trains in 2003 for operation on the London Euston - Watford Junction line to assist its fleet of Class 313 EMUs. 


For their respective operators, the 508s commonly work:



508301 arrives at London Euston in October 2007, one month before becoming part of the London Overground fleet.

Originally the 508s were numbered 508001 - 508043.


When they moved to Merseyside, they were renumbered 508101-508143 to avoid confusion with the Class 507s.


The current list of Merseyrail units is 508103/104/108/110-112/114/115/117/120/122-128/130/131/134/136-141/143


Merseyrail 508s were refurbished in 2003-2004, the first unit to re-enter service being 508110. The final unit to leave for the works for refurbishment was formerly black-striped 508137.


SET units were renumbered 508201-508212 when they were refurbished in 1996. A refurbushment by Wabtec is underway, 508205 being the first to receive this.


Silverlink units were renumbered 508301-508303 when they were refurbished in 2003.






Liveries


508s have appeared in many colours over their lifetimes, more so than any EMU of similar type.



BR Blue and Grey (1979-1994): the initial livery stood the test of time, lasting until well into their careers on Merseyside. The units also carried the MPTE  69  logo and Merseyrail branding on the driver's side of the outer ends of the driving vehicles.


Merseyrail Original (1993-2001; repaints 2001-2004): the original yellow livery was exclusive to Merseyside EMUs; this was a yellow basecoat with white around the windows and black and grey stripes.


Merseyrail Revised (1999-2004): a simple variation of the original Merseyrail livery - no black stripe, and a lighter base yellow.


Merseyrail Refurbished (2003-): radically different from the others, it involves a silver basecoat, with addition of yellow stripes which resemble those of a tiger. Additional 'M' branding appears on the front ends and on the sides, as does a 'Merseyrail' vinyl. Because the vinyl was purchased without graffiti protection, this does not wear well if vandalised, as several sets are running round the network with Ms missing.


Connex Yellow and White (1996-2006): a white basecoat with some yellow effects down the sides.


South Eastern Trains (2005-2006): A white background, with yellow and black side stripes. Unit 508208 was one of the first to receive this, in May 2005. 


Southeastern  (April 2006-): A change is under way, with the doors being painted in the corporate lilac, the body sides will be the white, black and grey carried by the 465/466 fleet.







Silverlink Metro (2004-): Silverlink's 508s' purple, green and silver livery was applied when they were modified in 2003.


Capital of Culture advertising livery (2008-): one of the four sets in the promotional Capital of Culture liveries is a 508. This set, 508134, shows off the theme of creativity with a purple background. Photographs depicted focus on some of the weird and wonderful innovations from Liverpool, such as the SuperLambBanana. The colourful liveries have met with mixed opinion amongst travellers. The purple train can most often be found working the Southport - Hunts Cross line as it is currently route restricted.






Naming





The nameplate affixed to 508136.



In late 
2004, to mark Liverpool's success in being named 




European Capital of Culture



 
2008, Merseyrail named 508136 'Capital of Culture'. This name was affixed using vinyl transfers as opposed to cast metal nameplates.




Incidents



Crowhurst derailment


On 6th March 2007 a Class 508 (set 508210), forming the 0500 
Tunbridge Wells to 
Gatwick Airport service, derailed near 
Crowhurst, Kent, after hitting a fallen tree on the line. None of the eight people on board was hurt.1

Supermarket tabloids




This article is about the American supermarket tabloid.  For the British tabloid newspaper, see 
The Sun (newspaper).  

Sun is a 
supermarket tabloid owned by 
American Media Inc. 


Its contents have often come under question and has been widely regarded as  
sensationalistic writing.  Since a 
1992 invasion of privacy case, a small-print disclaimer printed beneath the masthead has warned readers to  suspend belief for the sake of enjoyment.  


The paper was founded by Mike Rosenbloom, then-publisher of 
Globe Magazine, as a competitor to 










Weekly World News









, and its early contents reflected the same kind of imaginative journalism. When both papers were consolidated under American Media Inc. ownership, Sun's content came to specialize in recurring stories on 
Bible prophecy, 

Nostradamus
, 
global warming, the 
apocalypse, 
epidemics, and future 
war. Sun also features health articles dealing with 
miracle 
cures of 
diseases such as 
chronic pain and 
arthritis, as well as numerous  
strange but true  articles from across the country -- in fact, the strange but true stories make up the bulk of the paper's content, although they are almost never featured on the front page. 


Following the 2007 discontinuation of Weekly World News as a separate publication, Sun began printing a small  pull-out  insert of Weekly World News stories and columns. 


Sun photo editor 








Robert Stevens







 became the first victim of the 

2001 anthrax attacks
. He died as a result of a letter sent to the offices of American Media, the parent company of Sun,

Homosexuality was legal in Iraq under 


Saddam Hussein

 until late 2001, when under pressure from religious conservatives he criminalised the act of sodomy. A law passed in 2001 made sodomy punishable by imprisonment, and repeated convictions punishable by death. It should be noted however that despite the change in law there where no known cases in which the death penalty was applied for the offence by Iraqi Courts. Hussein had previously refused to criminalise homosexuality, as it went against the Secular Socialist beliefs of the Ba'ath Party .


The legal status of homosexuality remains something in dispute in a post-Saddam Iraq.  Homosexuality is not de jure illegal in Iraq, but it is taboo.  As of 2008, Iraq is in a de facto state of civil war and some militias have been known to seek out and kill homosexuals and transgender Iraqis.



Criminal code: Ba'athist



The authoritarian nature of the Ba'athist government makes it difficult to gather definitive information about what were the Ba'athist polices with regards to 
sexual orientation or 
gender identity.  In the United Nations, the Iraqi delegation cited religion, despite being a 
secular state at the time as their reasoning for opposing efforts to have the international body support 
gay rights.


Yet, homosexual practices between consenting adults in private were not officially made illegal in Iraq until 2001, when it was made a capital crime.  Prior to that point, Iraqi gays and bisexuals who lived during the 1980s - 1990s have since reported that a 
Ba'athist crackdown on homosexuality and establishments known to function as 
gay bars took place in the 1990s. 


This is also around the same time that the Ba'athist regime lost the first 
Persian Gulf War, and faced an uprising in northern and southern Iraq, and this crackdown may have been part of a larger attempt by the government to appeal to Sunni and Shiite social conservatives as the early 1990s.


The practice known as 
honor killings were also legalized in the early 1990s, and thus a 
LGBT Iraqi could face being executed by their kin for bringing dishonor to their family.




Criminal code: Post-Ba'athist



In 2003, 
Paul Bremer ordered that the 


Iraqi Penal Code

  criminal code would revert back to its 1969 edition, while the Iraqi civil code would revert back to its 1972 edition.  Bremer did not address the Iraqi religious courts of personal status.  While the penal code does not explicitly deal with homosexuality or cross-dressing, it does contain provisions that could be used to punish such practices.





 Some news reports about the legal status of homosexuality in Iraq had wrongly asserted that Paragraph 111 legalizes the practice of honor killings.  Paragraph 41 (1) creates a legal right of a husband to  punish  his wife as the law and custom dictate.  In the same paragraph, (2), their is a legal right to commit acts of violence against persons who have committed a felony or a misdemeanor, if it is a part of a plan to apprehend them.







 Paragraph 43 - Creates a right of self-defense, to the point of killing the offender, if it is to avoid rape or buggery of a man or a woman, against his or her will. 







 Paragraph 200 (2) - Prohibits, with a maximum punishment of seven years imprisonment, any person seeking to create or associate with an organization that seeks to,  change the fundamental principles of the constitution or society ,  the basic social and economimc laws of the State or the fundamental laws of society .







 Paragraph 206 - Requires all organizations and clubs to ask and receive formal authoriziation, or else face fines and impriosnment.  The courts have the power to require such organizations and clubs to dissolve and Paragraph 208 makes it a illegal to promote the ideas mention in Paragraphs 200 - 202 with a maximum penalty of 500 dinars and seven years impriosnment.







 Paragraph 210 - Prohibits the broadcast, or distribute any sort of publication or record, of any information or ideas that, among other things,  disturbs the public peace . 







 Paragraph 215 - Any person who produces, imports, exports or obtains a picture, written material or sign with intent to trade, distribute, display or exhibit such material, which, by its nature, endangers the public security or brings the country into disrepute unless he was acting in good faith is punishable by detention plus a fine not exceeding 300 Dinars or by one of those penalties







 Chapter 7 Section 7 Paragraph 368 - Any person who willfully commits an act which spreads a dangerous disease that endangers the lives of others is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 3 years.  The punishment is 1 year if it is ruled to be accidental.







 Chapter 8 Section 4 Paragraph 376 - Any person who obtains a marriage certificate knowing it to be invalid for any reason in secular or canonical law and any person who issues such certificate knowing the marriage to be invalid is punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding 7 years or by detention.







 Chapter 8 Section 3  Paragraph 401 - Any person who commits an immodest act in public is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 6 months plus a fine not exceeding 50 
dinars or by one of those penalties.







 Chapter 8 Section 3 Paragraph 402 - (a) Any person who makes indecent advances to another man or woman shall be punished by a period of detention not exceeding 3 months plus a fine not exceeding 30 dinars.  The penalty will be a period of detention not exceeding 6 months plus a fine not exceeding 100 dinars if the offender, having been previously convicted for such offense, re offends within a year of the date of such conviction.







 Chapter 8 Paragraph 403 - Any person who produces, imports, publishes, possesses, obtains or translates a book, printed or other written material, drawing, picture, film, symbol or other thing that violates the public integrity or decency with intent to exploit or distribute such material is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 2 years plus a fine not exceeding 200 dinars or by one of those penalties.   Also applies to those people that advertise such material or media.







 Chapter 8 Paragraph 404 - Any person who himself or through some mechanical means sings or broadcasts in a public place obscene or indecent songs or statements is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 1 year or by a fine not exceeding 100 dinars.







 Paragraph 434 - Insult is the imputation to another of something dishonorable or disrespectful or the hurting of his feelings even though it does not include an imputation to him of a particular matter. Any person who insults another is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 1 year plus a fine not exceeding 100 dinars.







 Paragraph 438 - The following persons are punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 1 year plus a fine not exceeding 100 dinars or by one of those penalties: (1) Any person who publishes in any way a picture, remark or information in respect of the private or family life of another, even though such information is true and such publication causes him offense.







 Paragraph 501 - Any person who washes themselves in a city, town or village in an indecent manner or appears in a public place in an indecent state of undress is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 10 days or by a fine not exceeding 5 Dinars.







 Chapter 5 Paragraph 502 - Any person who loiters in a public place or observes such a place with indecent intent or for an indecent purpose is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 10 days or by a fine not exceeding 5 dinars.




Paragraph 397 would appear to set the minimum age for sexual consent, for men and women, at eighteen.  It is possible that another Paragraph, 396, prohibits adult, consensual and non-consensual 
anal sex, although it is difficult to determine with the available English translations 
http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf.  The paragraph contains  or  in between two crimes.




 Militias 



As of 2007, the two major Iraqi militias; the 





Badr Organization




 and the 

Mahdi Army
 are among those Iraqi Shiite militias that have been linked to the kidnapping and killing of Iraqis for homosexuality or being transgender. 


Reports of the status of 
gay rights in Iraq and the militias  sexual cleansing  campaign surfaced in 2005 through IRIN reports, and articles by people such as University student 
Edward TJ Brown and reporters 


Peter Tatchell

, and 







Doug Ireland






.  The issue was subsequently picked up by the gay press and some mainstream news sources such as the 

BBC
, but has largely been ignored by the mainstream American press.


On February 5th, 2005 the 

IRIN
 issued a reported titled  Iraq: Male homosexuality still a taboo.   The article stated, among other things that 
honor killings by Iraqis against a gay family member are common and given some legal protection.  The article also stated that the 2001 amendment to the criminal code stipulating the death penalty for homosexuality  has not been changed , even through Paul Bremer clearly ordered the criminal code to go back to its original 1969 edition.1


In March, 2005 a rally was held in the United Kingdom, where speakers for the Iraqi Organizations For Women's Freedom opposed efforts by Iraqi religious parties to introduce 
Sharia law into Iraq2 and some mention was made that Sharia law would mean the death of women's rights along with the rights of gays and non-Muslims in Iraq.  This Iraqi feminist organization is supported by the Iraqi Workers-Communist Party, but neither organizations will talk about gay rights issues in Iraq or answer inquires from foreigners about the issue.


The 
Iraqi Committee For Personal Privacy and Freedom has an online website that does support 
gay rights issues but it is unclear how influential this new Committee will be.  A similar organization called the 

Iraqi Scientific Humanitarian Committee
 also exists online and claims to be an Iraqi gay rights organization.


On August 5th, 2005 the 

IRIN
 issued a report on the rise of male teenage prostitution in Iraq, and the strong moral opposition to homosexuality in general.3 The report seems to suggest that even absent a specific criminal prohibition the parents or relatives of an Iraqi homosexual may try to kill them.


The United States Multi-National Security Transition Command in Iraq has been overseeing the Iraqi armed forces training and discipline and seems to have been interpreting Paragraph 402
as only applying to 
rape.  This Command has also drafted a new military code for Iraq that
will be introduced sometime after the Iraqi election.4 It is unknown if the new military code will bar Iraqi homosexuals from military service or make homosexual acts a crime under military law.


Since 2005 there have been reports that the 
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq's 





Badr Organization




 has been involved in 
death squad campaigns against 
LGBT Iraqis citizens, and that they have gotten support for such policies by the 







Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani






5


This is partly due to a fatwa issued in October, 2005 by Iranian-born Iraqi 
Shiite cleric 







Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani






, published on the Arabic portion of his homepage, stating that homosexuality and lesbianism are both  forbidden  and that they should be  Punished, in fact, killed. The people involved should be killed in the worst, most severe way of killing. 6  While the fatwa for male homosexuality was removed from the website in May, 2006, it was not revoked. The fatwa for female homosexuality is still on the website.


Also in March of that same year, a gay Canadian peace activist named 

James Loney
 was kidnapped by an Iraqi militia and his family and the Canadian government kept his 
sexual orientation a secret for fear that his kidnappers would kill him.7


In January 2007 members of the Iraqi Government criticized a report on the 
human rights situation in Iraq.  One of the reasons that the government officials were critical of the report was because of its inclusion of 
gay rights in its review of human rights issues in Iraq.




 Operation Iraqi Freedom 



When 
Coalition Provisional Authority chief executive 
Paul Bremer took control of Iraq in 2003 he issued a series of decrees that restored the Iraqi criminal code back to its original 1969 edition, abolished the death penalty (which the new formed Iraqi government restored in 2005), and removed most restrictions on free speech and assembly.


However, a 2004 article in the 
New York Times noted that homosexuality is still a crime in Iraq ( Killings Surge in Iraq, and Doctors See a Procession of Misery  by Alex Berenson, September 26, 2004);





  Besides doing autopsies, the doctors at the institute specialize in the examinations of women accused by their husbands of not being virgins when they married, a serious charge that can lead to an annulment. The doctors also examine men accused of homosexuality, a criminal offense in Iraq. They must also approve all marriages of girls 14 or younger, verifying that they have reached puberty and are physically capable of intercourse. 




It is unclear, from the article, the context in which homosexuality is a crime or based on what part of the 1969 criminal code is being invoked.  The Iraqi Interim Governing Council did enact a Resolution (soon repealed) giving Iraqi Muslim Courts of Personal Status more authority to settle disputes dealing with marriage, family and other religious matters and it is possible that homosexuality is being treated as a crime under Islamic Personal Status courts, although an English translation of the current Iraqi Law for Personal Status is not available online.




Iraqi elections of 2004



Some members of the Sunni insurgency, claimed that they were engaging in violence in order to prevent gay marriage from being legalized in Iraq.  Yet, it is hard to take this justification at face value.


None of the Iraqi political parties have taken any statement in favor of 
gay rights.  In fact the political parties often refuse foreign inquiries about where their political party stands on the topic of gay rights.




 Iraqi Constitution 



Early drafts (in English) of the Iraqi constitution contained a provision that asserts that none of the rights or liberties protected in the Constitution will apply to  deviants.   Later revisions of the Iraqi Constitution appear to have remove the deviants clause, but have several clauses throughout the document that assert that 
Islam will be the foundation of the law and that the various civil liberties shall be limited by  public morality , i.e. Islam.




 LGBT Iraqi Exiles 



An exile association of 
LGBT Iraqis has been working with the British human rights organization, 





OutRage!




, to make the international community more aware of the anti-gay death squad campaign.




Current situation



2008





CNN
 reports that gay Iraqis continue to be subjected to threats, rape, kidnapping and murder based on their sexual orientation.8


The first Gay rights and LGBT human rights Organisation established in London - United Kingdom 2005 by Ali Hili a gay right activist to defend Lgbt rights , raise awareness and campaigns against the killing of hundreds of Gay, Lesbians, Trans and Bisexual people in Iraq by Shia death squads and militia within the Iraqi government.

Vilma Santos-Recto (born Maria Rosa Vilma Tuazon Santos 
November 3, 
1953) is a popular multi-awarded actress and politician in the 

Philippines
. She's known as the  Queenstar  and  Star for All Seasons . She is currently governor of 

Batangas
. She is the  first woman governor of the province. She was previously the first woman mayor of 

Lipa City
.



 Acting career 



She started acting at the age of nine, after winning the title role for the hit drama film Trudis Liit (Little Trudis). She immediately received her first acting trophy as Best Child Performer from 
FAMAS for the same film.


Groomed as a lead actress in her teens, her popularity grew further, bolstered by her loveteam with actor 
Edgar Mortiz and rivalry with contemporary actress 








Nora Aunor







. She made the film Burlesk Queen when she lost to 








Nora Aunor







 in popularity. At the height of her showbiz career she was a consistent box-office drawer highlighted by comic-book adapted films like the 


Darna

 series and 

Dyesebel
, and dramatic/daring films like Burlesk Queen and Sinasamba Kita, among others. 


Regarded as the longest reigning Box-Office Queen of Philippine Cinema, her films broke box-office records several times in her career and is hailed as the Star for All Seasons and Queenstar. She also hosted her own top-rating musical variety television shows ('The Sensations', 'VIP' and the long-running multi-awarded 'Vilma').Though not really a singer but a natural dancer fond of doing 'acrobatic' dance performances in her TV show, she managed to earn gold record awards as a teener. 


Known for her versatility and intense acting, she honed her craft as she worked with various top caliber directors, writers and actors, and now holds the record for having the most acting awards ever by a Philippine actress from prestigious award-giving bodies, local and international. Critically acclaimed for tackling roles on various women's issues, her other major films include  Burlesk Queen , Rubia Servious , Relasyon, Sister Stella L, Dolzura Cortez, 

Dekada '70
, 
Bata, Bata, Paano Ka Ginawa?, and Anak. To date, she has almost 200 films under her belt with numerous commercial endorsements and television works on the side.




 Political career 



In 
1998, she entered politics and ran for mayor of 

Lipa City
, 

Batangas
 where she won by landslide victories in three consecutive elections. As the first woman mayor of Lipa City, she helped bring not just economic progress and infrastructure development to Lipa City, but more notably her various programs on public health, education and environment, which again earned various local and international awards and recognitions.


In 
2005, the 

University of the Philippines
 conferred her the 

Gawad Plaridel Award
 for her achievements and contributions both as an actress and a public servant.  In the same year she was conferred with honorary doctorate degree (honoris causa) in humanities by the Lipa City College. She was again honored in 
2006 by the University of the Philippines as one of the four awardees in UP's First Diwata Awards. 


Dr. Vilma Santos is married to Senator 

Ralph Recto
, who belongs to a well-known political clan in the Philippines. Together they have a son, Ryan Christian. She is also a mother to actor/model/television host 

Luis 'Lucky' Manzano
, from previous marriage to actor 


Edu Manzano

.



Running for Governor in Batangas


Mayor Santos-Recto ran for Governor in the 2007 elections challenging incumbent governor and 
jueteng lord 





Arman Sanchez




 and even her brother-in-law, Vice Governor 
Richard Recto (who is said to be not in good terms with his brother). People in Batangas were eagerly waiting for this match up. Mayor Santos-Recto's decision to run for governor of the province of 

Batangas
 resulted in a family feud as Ricky,his brother-in-law, also said that he will run for the same post. After spending some time thinking about the predicament she was in, Mayor Santos-Recto said that she opted to give way to Ricky but left people hanging as she said that she had until March 29 to decide and that it was still a long time before that date and anything may still happen. Mayor Santos-Recto was then being said to be interested in running as 
Congresswoman representing the 4th District of Batangas. To add spice to the situation, Vilma's husband re-electionist Senator 

Ralph Recto
 announced to the media that they would not support the candidacy of Ricky.


During the weekly flag-raising at the Lipa City Hall last 
March 5, 
2007, political leaders from different parts of the province gathered at the 

Lipa City
 Hall grounds to announce their support and ask Mayor Vilma Santos to run as Governor. Mayor Santos-Recto was too emotional to make a decision at that point and asked for a week to make up her mind.


She made her promise good to announce her decision, and on 
March 12, she announced before a jampacked crowd at the Lipa City Cultural Center that she will accept the people's challenge and run for provincial governor.  Banker 
Edwin Ermita, the son of incumbent Executive Secretary 









Eduardo Ermita








, will be her runningmate.


She ran under the banner of 
Lakas CMD after being endorsed by Speaker Jose de Venecia as the official candidate of the majority party. 
Kampi adopted her as their official bet for Batangas Governor instead of incumbent Governor Arman Sanchez.




Governor-elect


Santos-Recto was proclaimed as the duly elected Governor-elect of the province of Batangas on 
May 21, 
2007 after garnering 475,740 votes against Sanchez's 344,969 for a winning margin of more than 130,000. She is the first female governor of Batangas province.

Buddhist temples in Laos







Pha That Luang






the national symbol of Laos at sunset




Pha That Luang (Paa T-had Lu-uang) (Great Stupa in 

Lao
) is a 
Buddhist 
stupa in 

Vientiane
, 

Laos
. It was built in the 16th century under King 
Setthathirat on the ruins of an earlier 13th century 


Khmer

 temple, which the Lao believe was in turn built on a 3rd century 
Indian temple built by Buddhist 
missionaries from the 
Mauryan Empire who were sent by the Emperor 
Ashoka. Relics of 
The Buddha are said to be contained here.


Pha That Luang was destroyed by the 

Thai
 invasion in the 19th century, then later restored to its original design. The architecture of the building includes many references to 
Lao culture and identity, and so has become a symbol of Lao 
nationalism.


The area around Pha That Luang is now gated, to keep traffic out. Previously visitors could drive around the whole complex.

The Garde du Corps was the personal bodyguard of the king of Prussia and after 1871, the German emperor (in German: Kaiser). It was founded in 1740 by 
Frederick the Great with 
Friedrich von Blumenthal as its first commander. He died suddenly in 1745, but his brother 
Hans von Blumenthal, who, with the other officers of the regiment had won the 
Pour le Merite at its first action at 

Hohenfriedberg
, assumed command in 1747. Hans von Blumenthal was wounded leading the regiment in a successful cavalry charge at 

Lobositz
 and had to retire from the army. Initially the regiment was used partly as a training ground for officers as part of a programme of expansion of the cavalry. Early officers included the rake and memoirist 





Friedrich von der Trenck




, who describes the arduous life of sleep deprivation and physical stress endured by officers, as well as the huge cost of belonging. The Cuirasses, for example, were silver-plated.

Unlike the rest of the Imperial German Army, the Garde du Corps was recruited nationally and eventually reached a full corps strength. The Regiment wore a white cuirassier uniform with certain special distinctions in full dress. These included a red tunic for officers in court dress and a white metal eagle poised as if to fly on the bronze helmet. Other unique features of the regiment's full dress as worn until 1914, included a sleeveless supraweste with the star of the 

Order of the Black Eagle
 on front and back and the retention of black iron cuirasses edged with red, presented by the Russian Tsar in 1814. These replaced the normal white metal breastplates on certain special occasions.

The West Island Freeway is an ambitious project to connect the suburbs of 

Mumbai
 with downtown Mumbai. The project envisions the setting up of multiple flyovers over the 
Arabian Sea. The first phase of the project, known as the

Worli




 to the south with a 
cable stayed bridge spanning the

, which up until now has been the only road connection between the suburbs and the main city of Mumbai on the western sea front. The toll charges is proposed to be fixed at 

Rs.
38 for four wheel private vehicles and taxis.


The next stage of the project envisages the building of a 
freeway along the city's western sea board, and linking 





Worli




 with 






Nariman Point





, via 








Malabar Hill







. Additionally, this phase has now received environmental clearance too. But a plea has been raised at the courts opposing this project.

Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza (Duarte Nuno Fernando Maria Miguel Gabriel Rafael Francisco Xavier Raimundo Antonio de Braganca; 
September 23 
1907-
December 24 
1976), pronounced ) was a claimant to the 
throne of Portugal from 1920 until his death.



Birth


Duarte Nuno Fernando Maria Miguel Gabriel Rafael Francisco Xavier Raimundo Antonio de Braganca was born at Schloss 

Seebenstein
 in 

Austria
, the  son of 

Miguel II, Duke of Braganza
 and of his second wife, Princess Marie Therese of Lowenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg.  Duarte Nuno had two older half-brothers and eight sisters.


His paternal grandparents were 

Miguel of Portugal
 and 
Adelaide of Lowenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. His maternal grandparents were 
Charles Henry, Prince of Lowenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg and 
Princess Sophia of Liechtenstein.


Duarte Nuno s father was the Miguelist claimant to the throne of Portugal who opposed his cousins, the reigning line of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Braganza descended from Queen 

Maria II
.  Duarte Nuno s family had been disinherited by Maria II.  In spite of this, the Emperor 
Franz Josef I of Austria granted 
extraterritoriality to Schloss Seebenstein in order that Duarte Nuno and his siblings could legally be born in Portuguese territory in order to comply with the Portuguese law of succession.


The day after his birth, Duarte Nuno was baptised at Seebenstein.  His godparents were his aunt the Infanta Adelgundes and the husband of another aunt the Infante Alfonso Carlos of Spain, Duke of San Jaime (both of whom were represented by proxies).

Manuel II









Duarte Nuno s second brother, 

Francis Joseph
, died in 1919, and on 
July 21 
1920, his eldest brother, 

Miguel
, renounced his succession rights.  Ten days later on 
July 31 
1920, Duarte Nuno s father, Miguel II, abdicated his claim to the Portuguese throne in favour of Duarte Nuno. 1  Henceforth the Miguelists recognised Duarte Nuno as King Duarte II of Portugal, even though Portugal had become a republic in 1910 when Maria II s great-grandson, King 

Manuel II
 (who was still living in 1920), was sent into exile. Duarte Nuno used the title Duke of Braganza as a title of pretense.


Since Duarte Nuno was only twelve years old when he succeeded as Miguelist claimant to the Portuguese throne, his aunt, Infanta Aldegundes, Duchess of Guimaraes, acted as regent for him until his attained his majority.  In 1921, she issued a manifesto outlining the family s goals for the restoration of the monarchy.


The abdication of Duarte Nuno s father was intended to improve the relationship between the two monarchist groups in Portugal: the supporters of the 
Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line of Manuel II and the supporters of the Miguelist line of Duarte Nuno. The 
Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line was called  constitutional  because it had accepted a liberal constitution for Portugal.




Succession as Constitutional claimant

The Constitutional claimant to the throne, King Manuel II, had been overthrown and exiled in 1910. After the death of his uncle Afonso in 1920, Manuel had no close relatives who could succeed according to the Portuguese Constitutional Charter of 1826 (the constitution in force from 1842 until the overthrow of the monarchy in 1910). 2  The conflict between the Miguelist line and the 
Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line was not just about which person should be sovereign; it was also about how much power the sovereign should have. The Miguelist line traditionally believed in an autocratic absolutist monarchy, while the 
Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line believed in a constitutional monarchy.


In 1912, Duarte Nuno s father, Miguel, had met with Manuel to try to come to some agreement so that there would not be two claimants to the Portuguese throne, both living in exile.  Their representatives signed the Pact of Dover by which Miguel recognised Manuel as king, while Manuel recognised the succession rights of Duarte Nuno should Manuel and his uncle Afonso die without children. 3 The pact was unpopular with the supporters of both sides, with many claiming that it was never actually signed.


On 
April 17 
1922, a second agreement called the Pact of Paris was signed by the representatives of Duarte Nuno and Manuel in which Manuel agreed that the Cortes should select his heir if he died without one, while Duarte Nuno agreed to ask and recommend that his followers accept Manuel as king. 4


Strictly speaking the Pact of Dover and the Pact of Paris were only private agreements and had no legal value.  As constitutional claimant to the throne, Manuel could not act unilaterally without the Cortes.  But the agreements were important steps in reconciling the Miguelist line and the 
Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line and moving towards a united monarchist movement.


In 1927, Duarte Nuno s father, Miguel II, died.  On 
July 2 
1932, Manuel II died. Henceforth, the vast majority of monarchists, both Miguelist and Constitutional, supported Duarte Nuno as claimant to the Portuguese throne. Joao Antonio de Azevedo Coutinho, the head of Causa Monarquica and Manuel II s lieutenant while he was in exile, published a declaration in support of Duarte Nuno. 5  Later Duarte Nuno was received in audience in Paris by Manuel s mother, 
Queen Amelie.


While Duarte Nuno was accepted by the vast majority of monarchists, there were some supporters of the constitutional monarchy who continued to contest his claim.  Duarte Nuno was undoubtedly the legal heir of his grandfather, Miguel I, but there were doubts about whether he was the legal heir of the last reigning king of Portugal, Manuel II.  Articles 87 and 88 of the Constitutional Charter of 1826 (the constitution in force in 1910 when the monarchy was overthrown) stated that the throne passed first to the descendants of 

Queen Maria II
 (from whom Duarte Nuno was not descended) and only when they were extinct to collateral heirs. 6  Maria II had living descendants, but none of these had Portuguese nationality. Article 89 of the Constitutional Charter of 1826 stated that  no foreigner can succeed to the crown of the kingdom of Portugal . 7


There was also some doubt about Duarte Nuno s nationality. Duarte Nuno s grandfather had been sent into exile by the law of 
December 19 
1834. Neither Duarte Nuno nor his father were born in Portugal, but Emperor 
Franz Josef I of Austria had granted extraterritoriality to Duarte Nuno s birthplace and Portuguese soil had been placed under the bed where he was born. Article 8 of the Constitutional Charter of 1826 stated that Portuguese citizenship is lost  by those who are banished by sentence . 8 The fact that Duarte Nuno and his father had not been born in Portugal, and the fact that their family had been banished from Portugal, could therefore be used as arguments against them by their opponents (D. Duarte's line was not banished by judicial sentence, however the 1834 constitution in force at the time of D. Miguel I's banishment did not protect the citizenship of those 
exiled by law). On the other hand, when the Constitutional Charter of 1826 was re-instated in 1842, it 
cancelled the clause depriving Miguel I and his heirs of succession rights as 
dynasts, however their banishment had not been stipulated in that charter, but in a separate law not repealed until 1950.


A small minority of monarchists looked for a candidate other than Duarte Nuno. Manuel's genealogical heir was Crown Prince George of Saxony (a great-grandson of Maria II), but he was not Portuguese (as was required by Portuguese law for the succession); he was also a Catholic priest. The genealogical heir of Maria II's older brother Emperor 

Pedro II of Brazil
 was his grandson Prince Pedro of Orleans-Braganza; he too was not Portuguese, but the fact that he was Brazilian and therefore imbued with Portuguese culture made him a somewhat attractive candidate.  The closest heir who was undoubtedly Portuguese was Constanca Berquo de Mendonca, 4th 
Duchess of Loule (a great-great-granddaughter of King 

John VI
). Later, a lady called 
Maria Pia of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Braganza, who claimed to be the illegitimate daughter of King 

Carlos I
, also claimed to have succession rights. Her supporters played upon the traditional rivalry between the Miguelist line and the 
Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line.




Education


Duarte Nuno s first tutors were two Portuguese ladies Maria Luisa Castelo and Maria das Dores de Sousa Prego.  Later he was taught by the 
Benedictine monk Frei Estevao from the monastery of 
Cucujaes.  Duarte Nuno attended school at the 









Abbey of Ettal








 in 





Bavaria




 and the 









Abbey of Clairvaux








 in 

France
 and then completed his secondary education in 



Regensburg


.  He received a degree in agricultural sciences from the 






University of Toulouse





.  Although forbidden entry to Portugal by the law of exile against the descendants of 
Miguel I, he visited the country in secret in 1929.




Marriage and children


On 
October 15 
1942, in the cathedral of 
Petropolis in 

Brazil
, Duarte Nuno married Princess 
Maria Francisca of Orleans-Braganza (
September 8 
1914-
January 15 
1968).  The marriage was particularly popular since Maria Francisca was the great-granddaughter of Emperor 

Pedro II of Brazil
 the younger brother of Queen 

Maria II of Portugal
. The marriage thus united the two rival lines of the Portuguese royal family.  Maria Francisca and her family were also viewed as representatives of a liberal monarchy as opposed to the traditional conservatism of Duarte Nuno s family.


Duarte Nuno and Maria Francisca had three sons:







Duarte Pio
, current Duke of Braganza (born 1945).


 

Miguel, 7th Duke of Viseu
 (born 1946).


 

Henrique, 4th Duke of Coimbra
 (born 1949).






Transfer of 1816 title of Duke of Braganza


In 1945, Maria Francisca s brother, 
Prince Pedro Gastao of Orleans-Braganza, relinquished to Maria Francisca and her heirs his rights to the title of 


Duke of Braganza

 which had been created in 1816 in favor of his great-great-grandfather, Emperor 

Pedro I of Brazil
.


In 1826, Pedro had succeeded as King Pedro IV of Portugal, but two months later he was forced to abdicate in favor of his daughter, Maria II, while remaining emperor of Brazil.  Some legists held that Pedro had continued to be Duke of Braganza.  Certainly after Pedro abdicated as emperor of Brazil and returned to Portugal in 1831, he used the title Duke of Braganza  until his death in 1834.  These same legists held that the title passed to Pedro's son and heir, Emperor 

Pedro II of Brazil
, who after he was deposed in 1889 used the title during his exile in France.  The title was then inherited by Pedro II's daughter 
Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, then by her eldest son Prince Pedro de Alcantara of Orleans-Branganza, and then by his son Prince Pedro Gastao of Orleans-Braganza.  According to Portuguese peerage law, Prince Pedro Gastao could alter the succession to the title by relinquishing it to his sister.  Accordingly, Duarte Nuno regarded his wife and himself as the holders of the title of Duke of Braganza from the creation of 1816.




Return to Portugal


On 
May 27 
1950, the National Assembly repealed the laws of exile of 
December 19 
1834 and 
October 15 
1910. Duarte Nuno, however, did not return to Portugal until 1952 on account of a car accident in 





Thionville




 in which he was seriously injured.  He was presented with a residence in Portugal by the Fundacao Casa de Braganca.


Portuguese dictator 
Antonio de Oliveira Salazar thought about restoring the monarchy in 1951, after the death of President 
Oscar Carmona, but he preferred instead to maintain the Head of State like it appeared in the Constitution of 1933. 


In 1974, Duarte Nuno handed over his residence the Palacio de Sao Marcos to the 

University of Coimbra
.  From then until his death in 1976, he lived in southern Portugal with his unmarried sister, the Infanta Filippa.


Duarte Nuno was Grand Master of the 
Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vicosa and Sovereign of the 






Order of Saint Isabel





.  He was a Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the 

Sovereign Military Order of Malta
 and a Knight of the (Austrian) 






Order of the Golden Fleece





.


Duarte Nuno is buried in the Augustinian monastery in 
Vila Vicosa, the traditional burial place of the dukes of Braganza.

 Except where noted otherwise, data are given for materials in their 
standard state(at 25  C, 100 kPa)





Dimethylsulfoniopropionate ((CH3)2S+CH2CH2COO minus;; more frequently abbreviated to DMSP), is a 
metabolite found in marine 
phytoplankton, 
seaweeds and some species of terrestrial and aquatic 
vascular plants. Older scientific literature refers to it as dimethyl- -propiothetin. Although originally considered to act only as an 
osmolyte, several other physiological and environmental roles have also been discovered.


DMSP is broken down by marine microbes to form two major volatile sulfur products, each with distinct effects on the environment.  Its major breakdown product is 
methanethiol (CH3SH) which is assimilated by bacteria into 
protein sulfur.


Its second volatile breakdown product is 
dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3; DMS). Most DMS in seawater is cleaved from DMSP by the enzyme DMSP 
lyase, although many non-marine species of bacteria convert 
methanethiol to DMS.


DMS is also taken up by marine 
bacteria, but not as rapidly as methanethiol. Although DMS usually consists of less than 25% of the volatile breakdown products of DMSP, the high reactivity of methanethiol makes the steady-state DMS concentrations in seawater approximately 10 times those of methanethiol (~3 


nM

 vs. ~0.3 nM).  Curiously, there have never been any published correlations between the concentrations of DMS and methanethiol.  This is probably due to the non-linear 
abiotic and microbial uptake of methanethiol in seawater, and the comparatively low reactivity of DMS.  However, a significant portion of 
DMS in seawater is 
oxidized to 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).


There is a considerable interest in DMS in the scientific literature that focuses on 
global climate.  DMS is thought to play a role in the earth's heat budget by decreasing the amount of 
solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface.


DMSP has also been implicated in influencing the taste and odour characteristics of various products. For example, although DMSP is odour- and tasteless, it is accumulated at high levels in some marine 
herbivores or 
filter feeders when feeding on diets with a high DMSP content. Increased growth rates, vigour and stress resistance among animals cultivated on such diets have been reported in the scientific literature. However, the volatile breakdown product of DMSP, DMS, is responsible for repellent, 'off' tastes and odours that develop in some seafood products after death because of the action of bacterial DMSP-
lyase and during processing because of the thermal decomposition of DMSP into DMS and 
acrylate.

Captain Beefheart







Mirror Man is the fifth 
album by 



Captain Beefheart


   His Magic Band.  It contains material which was recorded in 1967 for 






Buddah Records





, and which was originally intended for release as part of an abandoned project entitled It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper. Much of the material from this project was subsequently re-recorded and released through a different label as 

Strictly Personal
 (1968). The tapes from the original sessions, however, remained under the care of Buddah, who took four of the unissued tunes and released them as Mirror Man in 1971.

The album is dominated by three long, 
blues-rooted jams featuring uncharacteristically sparse lyrical accompaniment from Beefheart, whose real name is Don van Vliet. A fourth tune, the eight-minute  Kandy Korn , is an earlier version of a track that appears on Strictly Personal.  In 1999, Buddha Records issued an expanded version of the album entitled The Mirror Man Sessions, which features five additional tracks taken from the abandoned tapes.



History





See also: 

Strictly Personal



When the band went into the studio in late-1967 to record the follow-up to their debut album 

Safe as Milk
, which had been released earlier that year, it was with the intention of producing a 
double album, provisionally entitled It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper.1  Three of the tracks they recorded  Tarotplane ,  25th Century Quaker , and  Mirror Man  were long, psychedelic blues jams performed 'live in the studio' (in one take with no 
overdubs).1 These were intended to fill one of the set's two LPs.2
The band were also working on a number of other tracks, many of which would eventually be included on 

Strictly Personal
 (1968). These songs were characterized by their polyrhythmic structures and psychedelic themes, which marked a progression from the band's previous blues-rooted work on Safe as Milk.2


The Brown Wrapper concept, however, was at some point abandoned, and many of the tracks from the sessions were left unfinished and without any vocals.2  The reason for this remains unclear, though Beefheart biographer Mike Barnes suggests it was probably because the band's record label, Buddah, simply lost interest.2 A number of the abandoned tracks were re-recorded in 1968, and released as Strictly Personal, through producer 

Bob Krasnow
's own record label, 
Blue Thumb. The original session tapes, however, which included the three long blues jams along with a number of other unreleased songs, remained the property of Buddah, who released Mirror Man in May 1971, compiling the track list from the three 'live' jams and a finished version of  Kandy Korn  (which was one of the tracks re-recorded for Strictly Personal, where it appears in shortened form).3  The album's original pressing was put together somewhat carelessly, the record sleeve featuring an erroneous claim that it had been  recorded one night in Los Angeles in 1965,  while the cover art featured a shot of the band's 1970 line-up without drummer

Music and lyrics


The opening track,  Tarotplane , takes its title after the 



Robert Johnson


 song  




Terraplane Blues



 , which was about a popular 
1920s car.1  Throughout  Tarotplane 's nineteen minutes, van Vliet quotes lines from Johnson's song as well as from various other blues tunes including 

Blind Willie Johnson
's  You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond , 

Son House
's  Grinning in Your Face , and 

Willie Dixon
's  




Wang Dang Doodle



 .1 The song is built on a single two-chord blues riff, and also features an appearance by van Vliet on an Indian reed instrument called a 
shehnai, which was supposedly given to him by 


Ornette Coleman

, and which he plays in a different key from the rest of the band.4


Also on side one is an eight-minute  Kandy Korn , the second Magic Band tune to reference confectionery, following Safe as Milk's  Abba Zaba .5 A different, shorter version of this song appears as the closing track on Strictly Personal, where the production buries the later sections of the song under a profusion of backwards 
cymbals.5  Here, the track is heard without Krasnow's controversial production effects.


The second long 'live' blues jam,  25th Century Quaker , owes its surreal lyrics more to the psychedelic mood of the time, with its references to  blue cheese faces  and  eyes that flutter like a wide-open shutter.  Music historian 














Piero Scaruffi













 writes, in reference to both this song and  Kandy Korn ,  [the lyrics] are surrealistic and intentionally idiotic, a call to infantilism and acid trips in service of a musical theater of the absurd. 6 Around the time the song was recorded the band had been wearing black 
Quaker coats on stage, and even began to play their live shows as The 25th Century Quakers.4


The album closes with its fifteen-minute title track, which, like  Kandy Korn , was re-recorded for Strictly Personal, where it appears as  Son of Mirror Man   Mere Man .  An 

Allmusic
 review of the album cites  Mirror Man  as  one of the key tracks of Beefheart's entire career,  adding,  Probably the catchiest tune Beefheart ever wrote,  Mirror Man  has an almost funky, hip-swaying groove. 7




Critical and popular reception


Reviews of the album have made much of the length of its four compositions.  A contemporary review written for 

Rolling Stone
 magazine by 


Lester Bangs

, who opens by citing Beefheart as  one of the four or five unqualified geniuses to rise from the hothouses of American music in the Sixties,  states:  None of them really build in intensity or end up anyplace other than where they started, and would most likely prove intolerable to anyone already a bit put off by Beefheart's work. 8  Mike Barnes suggests the lengths are partly justified by other bands' long blues compositions of the period, such as the nineteen-minute  Revelation  from 

Love
's 

Da Capo
 (1966), or the eleven-minute  Alligator  from the 




Grateful Dead



's 

Anthem of the Sun
 (1968).4  Bangs, too, goes on to say,  If all those millions settled for 





Cream




 throttling  
Spoonful  for 16 minutes, their attention spans shouldn't have any trouble with this, which is not only better blues jamming but actually has more variety. 8  The album reached a peak UK chart position of number 49, although, like all other Magic Band releases, it failed to break into the top 100 in the United States.9

The Mirror Man Sessions''


In 1999, Buddha Records (which had renamed itself to correct the earlier misspelling of 'Buddah') reissued the album under the title The Mirror Man Sessions, which was released with a newly expanded track list and a 12-page booklet explaining the history of the recordings.  The additional tracks included on this release are also taken from the abandoned Brown Wrapper sessions, and thus yield a track listing which is somewhat closer to the original concept.  Other tracks from these sessions are included as bonus material on Buddha's 1999 issue of 

Safe as Milk
.

College Football Hall of Fame


Ronald J. Kramer (born 
June 24, 
1935 in 

Girard
, 





Kansas




) is a former 
American football player for the 

University of Michigan
 and in the 

National Football League
.

Kramer began his sports career playing for East Detroit High School in Eastpointe, Michigan.


In the tradition of Michigan athletes, Ron Kramer is considered to be ranked among the best. A three-sport athlete (football, 
basketball and 
track), Kramer led both the football and 
basketball teams in scoring for two years. Altogether, Kramer won a total of nine varsity letters in his three sports - the maximum number possible, as freshmen did not have athletic eligibility at the time.


Kramer's credits include two consensus football All-American selections (1955-56), the retirement of his jersey number (87) by the Wolverines following his senior season (one of only five numbers in school history to be retired), and the selection as the basketball team's most valuable player in each of his three seasons.  As team 
captain, he was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956.1  During his junior year, he averaged 20.4 points per game over a 22 game season and is a member of the career 1000-point club.2


In the NFL, Kramer played 10 seasons (1957,1959-1967) - the first seven with the 











Green Bay Packers










 and three with the 









Detroit Lions








. 


Kramer was elected into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1971. In 1981, he was named as a recipient of the 

NCAA
's Silver Anniversary Award in recognition of significant professional and civic contributions spanning 25 years after completion of his college eligibility.











Bennie Oosterbaan







, Kramer's football coach at Michigan, described his blocking and tackling ability as the most valuable asset to the Michigan squad. Oosterbaan said this of his star player:


 To top off his marvelous physical gifts of size and speed and strength, plus an uncanny coordination, Kramer was one of the fiercest competitors I've ever seen. Nothing was impossible for him - the impossible was only a challenge.  


In 1999, 

Sports Illustrated
 published a list of  The 50 Greatest Sports Figures From Michigan  (in all sports), and ranked Kramer seventh on the list behind 


Joe Louis

Magic Johnson

Bennie Oosterbaan







, 











Hal Newhouser










, and 

Dave DeBusschere
.   The 50 Greatest Sports Figures From Michigan,

 figures, including

Rick Leach
 (#22), 











Fritz Crisler










 (#31), and 
Harry Kipke (#40).

The Real Blonde is a 



1997


 
movie 
directed and 
written by 










Tom DiCillo









. It stars 

Matthew Modine
, 


Catherine Keener

, and 

Maxwell Caulfield
. The film is a 
satire on 

New York's
 
fashion and 
entertainment industries.


Plot


Joe is an aspiring actor working as a bus boy in a high-class restaurant. His long-term girlfriend Mary works as a cosmetician for the fashion industry and largely supports him with her steady income. Joe is more concerned with expressing himself than getting a paying job, and has been unwilling to accept roles that do not live up to his artistic standard. Mary supports Joe, but urges him to accept any role to get his foot in the door. Meanwhile, his co-worker Bob lands a lucrative role on a 
soap opera. Bob is a classically trained actor, but is willing to overlook the quality of the material for the money. He also has a fetish for natural blonde women, leading him to date Sahara, a naive model, and then dump her after discovering that her hair is dyed.


Joe swallows his artistic pride and meets with an agent, Dee Dee Taylor, who arranges for him to be an extra in a 


Madonna

 
video. Mary is harassed as she walks to work each day and begins taking a self-defense and anger management class on the advice of her therapist. The instructor encourages her to express her anger, and she finds the class extremely empowering. Bob is successful in his soap opera role and begins a relationship with his costar Kelly, a  real blonde .


At the Madonna video, the director treats Joe and the other extras like cattle. Joe meets Madonna's body double, Tina, a friendly aspiring actress, and gets himself fired for protesting an 













anti-Semitic statement












 made by the assistant director. Joe's firing sparks an argument between Joe and Mary. The pressure of Joe's career is straining their relationship, and they have not had sex in a long time. Mary's instructor, Doug, gives her a ride home from her class and makes a pass at her. She rebuffs him, but lies to cover up the incident to Joe. Meanwhile, Bob suffers 
erectile dysfunction and is unable to have sex with Kelly. She mocks his inadequacy and leaves him. 


Dee Dee takes pity on Joe and allows him to audition for the role of a  sexy 
serial killer . He reads his lines with Tina and begins to improvise his dialogue. He impresses the producers and lands the role. Tina invites him out for a drink and he resists her advances with some difficulty. Mary meets with her therapist and tells him about her experience with her self-defense instructor. He tells her that she must become comfortable with men showing their attraction to her and begins sharing his own sexual fantasies about her. She storms out of the session. Meanwhile, Bob is negotiating a long-term contract on the soap opera, but Kelly continues to taunt him on set. Bob threatens to quit the show and then forces the producer to kill off Kelly's character. 


Bob goes back to dating Sahara, with whom he is miserable. Joe breaks the big news about his role to Mary and they rejoice. Mary asks him if she is wrong for feeling angry when men hit on her. Joe supports her and threatens to beat up her therapist if he ever sees him again. They have sex for the first time in months and drift off to sleep, happy and satisfied. Mary wraps her hand around Joe's finger, revealing that his improvised monologue had been about his feelings for her.

The bridge in 

Godmanchester






Godmanchester Chinese Bridge is a 
landmark of the town of 

Godmanchester
, 

Huntingdonshire
 (now administered as part of 
Cambridgeshire, 

England
). It is a 
pedestrian 
bridge that spans the 

River Great Ouse
 and is, as the name suggests, built in an ostensibly 
Chinese style. The original was constructed in 
1827 to designs by the 
architect Gallier, but it fell into a bad condition and was replaced with a replica by the local council in 
1960.


The origins of the bridge are somewhat unusual.  
Chinese Chippendale  had been a fashion of the mid-
18th century, a time when the town was building a 
mansion for the 
Receiver General of Huntingdonshire by the river. Island Hall had included a rather smaller Chinese bridge, linking it to an ornamental island. It seems likely that this served as the inspiration for the public bridge several decades later   its white 
timbers are also in the Chinese Chippendale style.

The game was a flop due to  chunky

Iranian scientists




Mirza Ali was a Persian physician that lived in the seventeenth century. 

Nothing is known about Mirza Ali other than what can be gleaned from the unique copy of his therapeutic treatise that is preserved in the 
National Library of Medicine collections. 


His therapeutic manual is in Arabic, and according to a statement in it, was completed in the year 1659-60 CE. 


Where it was composed is not known. His name suggests that he was Persian, but the copy of the treatise that is preserved was made in 

India
.

History


Johnson Matthey traces its origins to 1817, when Percival Norton Johnson set up business as a gold 
assayer in London.1 In 1851 George Matthey joined the business and its name was changed to Johnson   Matthey.1 The following year the firm was appointed Official Assayer   Refiner to the 

Bank of England
.1 The company had branches in the cities of 

Birmingham
 and 

Sheffield
 to supply the 
Jewelry and 
Silverware   
Cutlery trade with raw materials ancillary supplies, such as 
Silver solder and 
flux which they manufactured. 



Johnson Matthey Bankers


In the 1960s, Johnson Matthey formed a subsidiary Johnson Matthey Bankers, which took its seat in the 
London Gold Fixing.


In the early 1980s the bank expanded its activities outside the bullion business, and by making high-risk loans provided over half of the parent company's profits in 1983. The quality of some of these loans turned out to be worse than expected, and the size of them exceeded the capital of the bank. To prevent a wider banking crisis, the Bank of England organised a rescue package in the evening of 
30 September 
1984, including purchasing JMB for  1.2

Labo, Camarines Norte
, 

Philippines





       

Vicente R. Lukban (
February 11, 
1860 
November 16, 
1916), was a 

Filipino
 officer in 
Emilio Aguinaldo's staff during the 

Philippine Revolution
 and the politico-military chief of 

Samar
 and 

Leyte
 during the 

Philippine-American War
. The Americans credited him as the mastermind of the infamous 











Balangiga massacre










, in which more than forty American troopers were killed. Later investigations by historians, however, disclosed that Lukban played no actual part in the planning of the attack.12



 Early life 


Lukban was born in 

Labo, Camarines Norte
 on February 11, 1860 to Agustin Lukban of 
Ambos Camarines and Andrea Rilles of 

Lucban, Tayabas
. He completed his early education at Escuela Pia in Lucban, continued his studies at 

Ateneo Municipal de Manila
, and took up 
Bachelor of Laws at the 

University of Santo Tomas
 and 

Colegio de San Juan de Letran
. 


He returned to Labo after resigning from his job at the 
Manila Court of First Instance. He married Sofia Dizon Barba and the union produced four children: Cecilia, Felix, Agustin, and Vicente, Jr. Sofia died after their last child was born. Lukban then left his children in the care of his brothers and sisters so that he could devote his time to the cause of the revolution.




 Philippine Revolution 


Lukban, thereafter, accepted the post of Justice of the Peace. In 1884, he was inducted into 
Freemasonry, Luz de Oriente ( Light of the Orient ). The organization had attracted many intellectuals and middle-class Filipinos to its ranks. In 1886, he stopped working in the judicial office and busied himself with agriculture and commerce in 
Bicol. He formed La Cooperativa Popular aimed at promoting the cooperative business activities of small and medium scale producers with the aim to increase their income from the lands by selling their products without passing through 
middle men. Part of the profits of the cooperatives were secretly remitted to the revolutionary movement of 
Andres Bonifacio, the 
Katipunan. The cooperative also served as an effective covert means of spreading the ideals of the revolution. Their members could move around freely without arousing the suspicion of the Spanish authorities.


By 1896, Lukban had centralized the funds of the cooperatives into the coffers of the revolution. He periodically remitted money to the evolving revolutionary movement. At the same time, he acted as an emissary of the 
Katipunan unit in 
Bicol to gather information about the Spanish movements in Manila and to determine how such movements affected Bicol provinces. On one of his trips to Manila, he was arrested by the guardia civiles, ( civilian guards ) and charged with conspiring to overthrow the government. He was imprisoned in Bilibid prison and tortured at 





Fort Santiago




. While Lukban was still in prison, the 

Philippine Revolution
 began, led by the  Cry of Balintawak , on 
August 26, 
1896. On August 18, 1897, he was released from jail, together with 

Juan Luna
 and immediately thereafter, joined the revolutionary government s armed forces. 


In the army, he was commissioned to serve as one of 
Emilio Aguinaldo's officers. Lukban was among the few who assisted Aguinaldo in planning war strategies and activities. When the 
Pact of Biak-na-Bato was signed, he was asked by Aguinaldo to be one of the members of his party going into 
exile in 

Hong Kong
. Lukban spent his exile in 

Hong Kong
 studying 
military science under the Lord Commander Joseph Churchase of the 




British Naval command



. This enabled him to master the arts of soldiery   
fencing, 
shooting, 
gunpowder and 
ammunitions preparations, and the planning and execution of war strategies and tactics.


Shortly after Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine Independence in 1898, Lukban was sent to the Bicol region to direct military operations against the Spaniards. His successes in Bicol ushered him into a new and challenging assignment: as 

Leyte
 and 

Samar
's politico-military chief. Lukban married his second wife Paciencia Gonzales in Samar. This union produced eight children: Victoria, Juan, Maria, Fidel, Rosita, Ramon, Jose and Lourdes.




 Philippine-American War 


On 
December 31, 
1899, 100 Filipino riflemen under Lukban gathered and he proclaimed himself the new governor of 

Samar
 under the 

First Philippine Republic
. When the 
U.S. 1st Infantry Regiment landed on Samar s shores in January 1901, they were met by suicidal charges of 
bolomen under Lukban s command. Nevertheless, Lukban was soon forced to retreat into the island's interior, leaving behind an organized resistance network. Samarenos caught cooperating with the Americans were executed swiftly and dramatically. When U.S. General 

Arthur MacArthur
 offered Lukban amnesty in exchange for his surrender, he turned it down and swore to fight to the end. 


Although bearing command responsibility for the 











Balangiga massacre










, Lukban learned about it a week later, on October 6, 1901. Other than a letter to town mayors encouraging them to follow the Balangiga example on the same date, there are no published records of his reaction to the news or later comment from him.


After 
Baldomero Aguinaldo s capture in 1901, Samar, under Lukban's leadership, remained one of the few areas of Filipino Army resistance. American troops encountered few enemies to fight and found themselves constantly harassed by Lukban's guerrillas. However, two prisoners later revealed the location of Lukban s secret headquarters along the Caducan River. The prisoners warned that the fort was impregnable, but Major 

Littleton Waller
 sent scouts to investigate. On November 17, 1901, Waller attacked with an amphibious assault team up the river, as Captains 

Bearss
 and Porter attacked by land with forces from 

Basey
 and Balangiga. The amphibious assault was foiled by a Filipino trap, and Porter attacked alone. The Filipino soldiers fled before 
machine gun fire, leaving scaling ladders behind for the Americans. The retreating Filipinos were gunned down from behind as the American flag was raised above the garrison. It was a clear victory for the United States, with 30 Filipinos dead and the capture of Lukban and his lieutenants. The war on Samar, however, would not truly be over until the rugged interior was conquered.




Post-captivity


The public career of Gen. Vicente Lukban did not end with his captivity. He was elected governor of Tayabas (now 
Quezon province) in 1912 and re-elected in 1916. He died at his Manila residence on November 16, 1916.

Barclay Coppock (January 4, 1839-September 4, 1861) was a follower of 
John Brown and 
Union Army soldier in the 

American Civil War
. Along with his brother Edwin, he participated in the raid on 

Harpers Ferry
. In historic documents their last name was variously spelled  Coppock  or  Coppoc . The Coppoc brothers were raised in 




Springdale, Iowa



, where they met Brown while he was raising support for his Kansas Anti-slavery raids. Edwin was hung in Charlestown, Virginia while Barclay eventually escaped to Canada; his flight was aided by 
Samuel Kirkwood the governor of Iowa, who refused to extradite him when Barclay was discovered hiding in Iowa. Barclay later joined the Union Army during the 

American Civil War
. Barclay was killed in action when his train plunged into a ravine on the 





Platte River (Missouri)




.  Confederate Raiders had cut through the supports of the train bridge, the incident now called the 













Platte Bridge Railroad Tragedy

Ioan Inocen iu Micu-Klein



Inocen iu Micu-Klein (
1692 
1768) was a 
Romanian Greek-Catholic 
Bishop of 

Blaj
 who played an instrumental role in the establishment of national rights for 

Romanians
 in 






Transylvania





 (part of the 
Habsburg Monarchy at the time of his life). 


Life


He was born as Ioan Micu (Inocen iu being his clergy name, and Klein the German translation of his surname, sometimes rendered back into 

Romanian
 transcription as Clain) in 

Sadu
, nowadays in 
Sibiu County, to a lower-class family, was schooled by the 
Jesuits in 

Cluj
 and trained in 
theology in 








Trnava







.


On 
February 25, 
1729, 
Emperor 


Charles VI

 appointed him the Greek Catholic Bishop of the 
Archdiocese of F g ra  and Alba Iulia in Transylvania, as well as 

Imperial
 Councilor. In September of that year, he was awarded the title of 
Baron, and given a seat in the 
Transylvanian Diet. That month, Micu became a priest, and joined the 
Basilian 
monastic order, before being confirmed as bishop in November. In 1737, he moved the bishopric seat from 
F g ra  to Blaj, and laid the foundations to the local cathedral in 1741.


As a member of the Diet (Parliament) of Transylvania, Inocen iu Micu began to press the 
Habsburg Monarchy to fulfill the Agreement that conversion to 
Greek Catholicism would bring with it 


Roman Catholic

-like 
privileges for Romanian inhabitants also, and an end to 
serfdom.


First pressing for rights for clergy and converts, he soon began to petition for freedom for all Romanians. Micu petitioned the Habsburg court for over forty years to this end. His perseverance ultimately made both the Austrian Empress 
Maria Theresia and Transylvania's Diet declare themselves offended - the Hungarian majority in the Diet opposed the liberation of the work force or the awarding of political rights to Romanians (



Vlachs


), considered by the Diet as  moth for the cloth . 



Letter with signature: Joannes In[nocentius] L[iber] B[aron] Klein Vescovo di Fogarasi''



Exiled in 
1744, and asked to give up his bishopric in 
1751, Micu died in 


Rome

 17 years later.

Friedrich Karl Flick (
February 3, 
1927 in 















Berlin














 - 
October 5, 
2006 in 

Auen
 on the 
Worthersee, 

Austria
) was a German-Austrian 
industrialist and 
billionaire. 

He was born the youngest of the sons of 
Friedrich Flick and Marie Schuss. After his studies, he worked in his father's company. In 1972, when his father died, he ( FKF ) inherited the major part of the family business, which had made massive use of concentration camp laborers.


The Flick family has a Nazi legacy and has always refused to pay compensation to wartime victims. As the sole owner of the Friedrich Flick Industrial Holding (Industrieverwaltung) he had interests in major companies including 

Daimler-Benz
, 
WR Grace, Gerling Insurance, 
Buderus, 
Dynamit Nobel, Feldmuhle and others. 


In 1975 he sold his part of Daimler-Benz to the 

Deutsche Bank
 for more than $ 1 billion. Major tax liabilities were avoided through  cultivation of the political landscape , - a process that turned into the 








Flick Affair







 in 1983 when it became apparent that about $25 million had been paid to German political parties in return for tax cuts and favorable rulings. 


Although Chancellor 


Helmut Kohl

 benefited from the dealings, he claimed he had  no recollections , while others resigned from their posts. In 1985 Flick sold off the remainder of his companies. When 

Deutsche Bank
 announced that it had bought his holdings for about $3 billion 
German marks, Flick retired in 

Austria
, where he became a naturalised citizen. 


He married three times and had two children from his second and third marriages. At the time of his death, he was the wealthiest person living in 

Austria
.

Mewar( The Light of Hinduism) (       may wahr (long  a  like  wand ), also called Udaipur Kingdom) is a region of south-central 

Rajasthan
 state in western 

India
. It includes the present-day districts of 
Bhilwara, 
Chittorgarh, 
Rajsamand and 
Udaipur. The region was for centuries a 




Rajput



 kingdom that later became a 
princely state under the 

British
. It was ruled by the 
Guhilot and 



Sisodia


 dynasties for over 1200 years.


The 


Marwar

 region lies across the 




Aravalli Range



 to the northwest, 


Ajmer

 lies to the north, 

Gujarat
 and the 


Vagad

 region of 

Rajasthan
 lie to the south, the 
Malwa region of 

Madhya Pradesh
 state lies to the southeast, and the 


Hadoti

 region of Rajasthan lies to the east.



Geography





Mewar Region



The northern part of Mewar is a gently sloping plain, drained by the Bedach   



Banas River


 and its tributaries, which empty northwest into the 

Chambal River
, a tributary of the 



Yamuna River


. The southern part of the region is hilly, and marks the divide between the Banas and its tributaries and the headwaters of the 



Sabarmati


 and 



Mahi


 rivers and their tributaries, which drain south into the 
Gulf of Cambay through 

Gujarat
 state. The 




Aravalli Range



 forms the northwestern boundary of the region, composed mostly of sedimentary rocks, like 
marble and 
Kota stone, which has traditionally been an important construction material. 


The region is part of the 
Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' 
ecoregion. Protected areas include the 





Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary




, the 





Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary




, the 
Bassi Wildlife Sanctuary and the Sitamata Game Sanctuary.


Mewar has a 
tropical climate. Rainfall averages 660 mm/year, and is generally higher in the southwest and lower in the northeast of the region. Over 90% of the rain typically falls in the period June to September every year, during the 
southwest monsoon.




History


The history of Mewar over the past 1200 years is essentially the history of the dynasty (which is the world's longest serving dynasty) and the state founded by 









Bappa Rawal








.



The Guhilots












Bappa Rawal








, a legendary figure in 




Rajput



 history, was allegedly of noble birth, belonging to the lineage of a certain Guha, ruler of the town of Nagda on the border between the present-day states of 

Rajasthan
 and 

Gujarat
. However, he spend his childhood as the servant of a 
Brahmin family, in ignorance of his purported lineage. His warlike temperament commended him to the attention of Maan Mori, a local chieftain who belonged to the 
Parmara clan of 




Rajput



s; Maan Mori is in some accounts said to have been Bappa Rawal's own maternal uncle. Be that what it may, Bappa Rawal soon usurped the territory of his patron / uncle and established himself as ruler of Mewar, an event usually dated to 734AD. 


All subsequent rulers of Mewar trace their lineage to 









Bappa Rawal








. The senior lineage of rulers descended from him were known as Guhilots (also Guhelots or Guhilas), a patronymic derived from the name of their purported distant forbear, the aforementioned Guha. 


Jauhar of 1303: 
Ala-ud-din Khilji, 
Sultan of Delhi, sent a marauding army across 

India
 at the turn of the 13th century; this army, commanded by 
Malik Kafur, soundly defeated the Guhilot rulers of Mewar in 1303. The impending fall of 








Chittorgarh







, the main bastion of the 
Guhilots, occasioned the famous Jauhar of 1303, when the womenfolk then resident within that fort collectively committed suicide rather than risk personal dishonour at the hands of the victorious invading army. The brave men wore saffron turban as a mark of performing saka, of running into battle with no hope of coming back. The injured and surviving 
Guhilot menfolk and their retainers are said to have subsequently took refuge in the nearby hills.




The Sisodias


Rana Hamir: The victorious Khilji sultans assigned the newly conquered territory of Mewar to the administration of Maldeo, ruler of the nearby state of 

Jalore
, who had allied with them during the recent war. In a bid to reconcile and co-opt the natives of the land to his rule, Maldeo arranged for the marriage of his widowed daughter Songari with Hamir, the scion of an impoverished cadet branch of the erstwhile ruling dynasty. 
Rana Hamir Singh re-established the state of Mewar in 1326 by engineering a coup d'etat against his father-in-law. The dynasty thus founded by Hamir, who was descended in direct patrilineage from 









Bappa Rawal








, came to be known as Sisodia after Sisoda, the mountain village whence Hamir hailed.



Rana Kumbha (1433-1468) was not only an expert in fortification but also an accomplished playwright and patron of music. Many of the historic monuments that dot Mewar were erected by him, including the 





Kumbhalgarh




 fort and the 



Vijay Stambha


 ( Tower of Victory ) in 








Chittorgarh







. 


Rana Raimal (1473-1509) is often overlooked due to his reign being interposed between two notable rulers. Maharana Raimal came to power by defeating his patricide predecessor, Udaysingh I in battles at Jawar, Darimpur and Pangarh. Early in Raimal's reign, Ghiyas Shah of 
Malwa attacked 
Chittor unsuccessfully. Soon after, Ghiyas Shah's general, Zafar Khan attacked Mewar and was defeated at Mandalgarh and Khairabad. By marrying Sringardevi (daughter of 
Rav Jodha), Raimal ended the conflict with the Rathores. During Raimals' reign, Raisingh Toda and Ajmer were recaptured. Raimal also strengthened the state of Mewar and repaired the temple of Eklingji in Chittor. The last years of Raimal's rule were marked by conflict between his sons with Prince Sanga (Sangramsingh) having to flee Chittor. The oldest sons, Prithiviraj and Jagmal were both killed. At this difficult juncture, the Rana was informed that Sanga was still alive and in hiding. Raimal summoned Sanga back to Chittor and died soon afterwards.      


Rana Sanga (1509-1527) was among the most prominent 




Rajput



 chieftains of his day. He initially allied with an invading 


Babur

 to overthrow 
Ibrahim Lodi, the 
Sultan of Delhi, in 1526. After this was accomplished, 
Rana Sanga led a combined 




Rajput



 army to defeat 


Babur

 and capture Delhi, but was himself defeated by Babur at the 
Battle of Khanua on 
March 16, 
1527.
Rana Sanga is famous for 80 scars on his body, he embodies the spirit of rajput to fight unto immortality. Legend says after being seriously injured still wanted the battle to continue and was poisoned by some of his nobles.



Rana Pratap


Main article: 
Rana Pratap


The greatest 




Rajput



 hero of all time, 
Rana Pratap (1540-1597) was Mewar's most illustrious ruler. Rana Pratap led the Rajputs against the Mughal army to preserve the independence of Mewar. He had to face not only 
Akbar's army but also had to fight against other Rajput kings like Raja 






Todar Mal





 and Raja 
Man Singh who aligned with the Mughals. In the Battle of 

Haldighati
 (1576), Maharana Pratap was badly hurt and was saved by his famous horse 
Chetak, who took him in an unconscious state away from the battle scene.




Mughal and British Suzerainty





Princely flag of Mewar


Udaipur: As the armies of the 







Mughal






 emperor 
Akbar moved to occupy Mewar in 1568, the then ruler, 
Maharana Udai Singh, father of 
Rana Pratap, retired to safety at 

Udaipur
, in the foothills of the Aravalli Range. It was at Udaipur that Pratap supplanted his father as head of the 
Sesodia clan. 
Rana Pratap's son Amar Singh was resident at the time of his father's death in exile. Udaipur remained the capital of the state until it acceded unto the 

Union of India
 in 1947.


Immediately after 
Rana Pratap's death, the 



Sisodia


s became vassals of the 







Mughals






, and served them faithfully for nearly two centuries. When the Mughal empire went into terminal decline in the 18th century, the 



Sisodia


s ventured a measure of autonomy, but were subdued by the 

Maratha
s, who exacted crippling tributes from them annually. To add to the woes of the land, the Sisodia rulers of this period dissipated much energy and resources in petty quarrels with their neighbours. The relentless turmoil drained both the country and its ruling family; in the early decades of the 19th century, the 



Sisodia


 rulers repeatedly petitioned the 

British Raj
 for protection from their neighbours and from the 

Maratha
s. Finally, in 1818, Mewar entering into 
subsidiary alliance with the 
British and became a 
princely state in the 


Rajputana Agency

. This arrangement continued until the 
independence of India in 1947, when Mewar acceded unto the 

Union of India
; it was later integrated into the 

India
n state of 

Rajasthan
.

 hilltop fort is one of the main tourist attractions of Mewar. The fort is a depiction of 




Rajput



 culture and values. It stands on a 2.4 square kilometre site on an 180 m high hill that rises rapidly from the plains below. The fort was sacked thrice by a stronger enemy. The first sacking occurred in 1303 by 
Alauddin Khilji. In 1535 
Bahadur Shah of Gujarat besieged the fort causing the women to commit 






Jauhar





. In 1568 Mughal emperor Akbar razed the fort to the rubble and once again the history repeated itself. In 1616 Mughal emperor 
Jehangir restored the fort to the Rajput but it was not resettled.

Texas's 23rd congressional district is the 8th largest 

congressional
 district in the country not counting at-large districts, stretching across the southwestern portion of 


Texas

. It is a 
Latino-majority district and its current Representative is 

Democrat
 

Ciro Rodriguez
.  


Geography


The district runs along the majority of Texas's border with 








Mexico







, just north of the 

Rio Grande
. While it encompasses numerous county seats and a few towns of regional economic importance, the district is predominantly rural, with no major urban area in the district, although it abuts the 
El Paso suburbs at its western point and 
San Antonio at its eastern point. Its large size is due to its low population density--one of the lowest in the country. It encompasses all of 

Big Bend National Park
 and 
Big Bend Ranch State Park. Major economic activities in the district include farming, ranching, oil and mineral extraction, recreation and tourism.




Demographics



As of the 
2000 census, the district contained 651,620 people.  Of these, 41% are Anglo, 55.1% Hispanic, 2% Black, and 2.2% other.1 The district's population is 74.6% urban.2  Per capita Income for the district is $18,692.  The district has a 6.5% unemployment rate. Of the employed, 71.8% is private, 19.4% government, and 8.4% self-employed.3 Major industries include Retail trade, Education services, Health Care, and Manufacturing.  222,012 households are within the district, with an average of 2.8 persons per household.4




Elections



Elections from 1967 to 1992


This district was created in 1967, after 
Wesberry v. Sanders resulted in Texas' previous congressional map being tossed out.  

Democrats
 held the district until 1993.




Elections from 1992 to 2002


In 1992, the 

Texas Legislature
 created the new 

28th District
 out of much of the 23rd's territory.  In the process, the legislature left a heavily Republican section of San Antonio in the 23rd.  Charging 8-year incumbent 

Albert Bustamante
 with neglecting the 23rd's needs, 

Republican
 

Henry Bonilla
 won by the largest margin of victory against an incumbent that year, and took his seat in 1993.


Even though the 23rd had a slight Democratic lean, Bonilla has had a very conservative voting record. Largely because of his popularity in San Antonio, he didn't face a credible challenge until 
2002, when former Democratic 
Texas Secretary of State 

Henry Cuellar
 came within 2 points of unseating him.




2004 election


During the 


2003 Texas redistricting

, the Republican-controlled 

Texas Legislature
 drew most of 


Laredo

, which had been one of the bases of the 23rd for its entire existence, into the 

28th district
.  In return, Bonilla received several heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs, all but assuring him of a 7th term.

2006 election


On 
June 28, 
2006, the 
U.S. Supreme Court, in 
League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry ruled that the 23rd District violated the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965.  The case turned on the fact that the 23rd District was a protected majority-Hispanic district--that is, if the 23rd was ever redrawn in a way to put Hispanics in a minority, a new majority-Hispanic district had to be created.  Although Hispanics made up 55 percent of the new 23rd's population, they only made up 46 percent of the new 23rd's voting-age population.  Therefore, the Court said, the new 23rd was not a true majority-minority district. The Court found that the new 

Austin
-to-

McAllen
 

25th District
 was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement.  The Court therefore ruled that the legislature had violated the rights of Hispanic voters.


As a result, on 
August 4, 
2006, a three-judge panel announced replacement district boundaries for the 2006 election in the 23rd district.  Due to the 23rd's size, nearly every district along the El Paso-San Antonio corridor had to be redrawn as well.  


The new 23rd lost many of the heavily Republican areas it inherited in 2003, as well as the rest of Laredo.  However, it received a large portion of heavily Democratic south San Antonio.  Further, four other districts were affected: the 28th (represented by Democrat 

Henry Cuellar
), 25th (Democrat 

Lloyd Doggett
), 

15th
 (Democrat 
Ruben Hinojosa) and 

21st
 (Republican 
Lamar Smith).  As a result, on 
November 7
2006 (the day of the general election), these five districts held open primaries.  If no candidate were to receive as much as 50% of the vote, a runoff election in December would decide the seat.5


In the 23rd, incumbent Bonilla had two significant opponents, both Democrats: 

Vietnam War
 veteran 
Rick Bolanos and former 28th District Congressman 

Ciro Rodriguez
.  In the Spring, Bolanos won the now moot 23rd district Democratic primary.  Rodriguez lost a primary challenge to Cuellar in the 28th district, which was also vacated, but the redrawing placed Rodriguez' home, along with most of his old base, into the 23rd district.  Other candidates in the special election were: retired 
San Antonio Fire Department district chief 
Albert Uresti, who is the brother of state Rep. 


Carlos Uresti

; 
Lukin Gilliland, a rancher and businessman from 

Alamo Heights
; Adrian De Leon, the owner of a truck stop in 

Carrizo Springs
 that advertises  the best Bar-B-Q in town ; and 
August Beltran of 
San Antonio. 
Craig T. Stephens, an independent candidate, also filed to run. 6



Rick Bolanos dropped out of the race on 
October 19, 
2006 and endorsed fellow democrat 
Lukin Gilliland.


On 
November 7 
2006, 

Henry Bonilla
 received significantly more votes than any of his challengers, but did not receive 50% of the votes cast. Though none of the Democratic candidates came close to Bonilla individually, as a whole the six Democratic candidates received slightly more votes than Bonilla, the only Republican candidate. However, neither party received more than 50% of the vote because of a third party candidate.


A runoff election was held on 
December 12 
2006 between Bonilla and Rodriguez, with Rodriguez the winner.

An 
antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)



The Krill fishery is the commercial 
fishery of 
krill, small 
shrimp-like marine animals that live in the oceans world-wide. Estimates for how much krill there is vary wildly, depending on the methodology used. They range from 125 725 million tonnes of 
biomass globally.1 The total global harvest of krill from all fisheries amounts to 150   200,000 tonnes annually, mainly 
Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and 
North Pacific krill (E. pacifica).

Krill are rich in 
protein (40% or more of dry weight) and 
lipids (about 20% in E. superba). Their 
exoskeleton amounts to some 2% of dry weight of 
chitin. They also contain traces of a wide array of 
hydrolytic 
enzymes such as 
proteases, 
carbohydrases, 
nucleases and 
phospholipases, which are concentrated in the digestive gland in the 
cephalothorax of the krill.


Most krill is used as 
aquaculture feed and fish 
bait; other uses include livestock or pet foods. Only a small percentage is prepared for human consumption. Their enzymes are interesting for medical applications, an expanding sector since the early 1990s.



 Technology 



Krill are small animals, considered a type of 
zooplankton, and hence need to be fished with very fine-meshed plankton nets. Such nets pose several problems: they tend to clog fast, and they have a very high 
drag, producing a 
bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. 



Trawling


 must hence be done at low speeds. Additionally, fine nets are also very delicate, and the first krill nets designed exploded while fishing through the krill schools. Furthermore, fine nets increase unwanted bycatch, such as fish fingerlings, which might have unforeseen side-effects on the ecosystem, even though large krill aggregations tend to be monospecific.


Yet another problem is bringing the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled out of the water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill's liquids. Experiments have been carried out to pump Antarctic krill, while still in water, from the cod end of the net through a large tube on board. This method had already been used by the small fishing boats in Japanese waters; it increases the capture capacity and the processing rate of krill.

The krill trawler FV Saga Sea''









































One of the first Antarctic krill trawlers to use this technique was the FV Atlantic Navigator, registered in 

Vanuatu
 and owned by the 



Norwegian


-based company 

Aker ASA
,2 which used this technique in the 2003/04 and 2004/05 fishing seasons. In these seasons, this ship alone caught 25% and 38% of the whole krill catch in 
CCAMLR regions.3 The successor ship of the Atlantic Navigator, the FV Saga Sea, can fish up to about 120'000 tonnes of krill annually,
a and Aker announced plans to build more such ships.4


Krill must be processed within one to three hours after capture due to the rapid 
enzymatic breakdown and the tainting of the meat by the intestines.1 They must be peeled because their exoskeleton contains 
fluorides, which are toxic in high concentrations.




 Products 






Deep frozen plates of 
Antarctic krill for use as animal feed and raw material for cooking.



Most krill is processed to produce fish food for use in 
aquariums and 
aquacultures. The krill is sold 
freeze-dried, either whole or pulverized. Krill as a food source is known to have positive effects on some fish, such as stimulating appetite or resulting in an increased disease resistance. Furthermore, krill contains 
carotenoids and is thus used sometimes as a pigmentizing agent to color the skin and meat of some fish. About 34% of the Japanese catch of E. superba and 50% of E. pacifica are used for fish food; the Canadian catch is used almost exclusively for this purpose.


Some 25% of the Japanese catch of E. superba is used in the form of fresh frozen krill as fish 
bait; and 50% of the E. pacifica catch is used as 
chum for sport fishing. About 43% of the Japanese catch of E. superba is processed for human consumption. The Japanese industry produces boiled, frozen krill and peeled tail meat. Other uses include krill pastes or processed krill as food additives, e.g. in the form of krill oil gel capsules.


Medical applications of krill 
enzymes include products for treating 
necrotic tissue and as 
chemonucleolytic agents. Of the 376 krill-related patents that had been registered world-wide until 2002, 17% related to medical uses. Most of these medical patents had been registered after 1988.5





 Antarctic krill fishery

Euphausia superba in the 
Southern Ocean from 1974 until 2003. (
FAO data1



Krill fishery in the 
Southern Ocean targets the largest species of krill existing, the 
Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which can grow to about 6 cm. Fishing began in the early 1960s, when the 



Soviet Union


 launched its first experimental operations. All throughout the decade, preparatory activities were carried out, resulting in small catches of a few tens of tonnes per year. Scientists mapped the locations of krill swarms to determine the best fishing grounds, and engineers developed and improved the equipment necessary to fish and process krill. In 1972, the Soviets set up a permanent fishery in 
Antarctic waters, landing 7,500 tonnes in 1973 and then expanding quickly. The Japanese began experimental krill fishing operation in the area in 1972 and started full-scale commercial operations in 1975.


Krill catch increased rapidly. In the 1980s, a few additional nations started operating in the area: 

Poland
, 










Chile









, and 

South Korea
. Their catches amounted to a few thousand tonnes annually; the lion's share went to the Soviet Union, followed by Japan. A peak in krill harvest was reached in 1982 with a total production of over 528,000 tonnes, of which the Soviet Union produced 93%. In the following two years, production declined. It is unclear whether this was due to the discovery of 
fluorides in the krill's exoskeleton or to marketing problems. The trade recovered quickly, though, and reached more than 400,000 tonnes again in 1987.


With the demise of the Soviet Union, two of its successor nations, 

Russia
 and 

Ukraine
, took over the operations. Russian operations and catches dwindled, and were abandoned altogether in 1993. Since then, 
Japan is one of the top producers, but facing stiff competition by other countries. Since 2000, the small 

South Korea
n Antarctic krill fishery has also expanded considerably. A 








U.S.







 company entered the market in 2001. The 



Norwegian


 company 

Aker ASA
 entered the business in 2003 with a ship registered in 

Vanuatu

In 1982, the 
CCAMLR (Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) came into force, as part of the 









Antarctic Treaty System








. The CCAMLR was originally signed by fifteen states; as of 2004 it had 24 members. Its purpose is to regulate the fishery in the Southern Ocean to ensure a long-term sustainable development and to prevent overfishing. In 1993, the CCAMLR set forth catch quotas for krill, which amount to nearly five million tonnes per year.8


The annual catch of Euphausia superba since the mid-1990s is about 100 120,000 tonnes annually, i.e., about one fiftieth of the CCAMLR catch quota. Still, the CCAMLR is criticized for having defined its catch limits too generously, as there are no precise estimates of the total biomass of Antarctic krill available and there have been reports indicating that it is declining since the 1990s.9 Plans to take up to 746,000 tonnes a year were disclosed at the 2007 meeting of 
CCAMLR.1011 


Fishing for Antarctic krill is commonly done from large stern trawlers using 
midwater trawls. For scientific purposes, vertical trawls using, for example, a 
bongo net, are also employed.




 Krill fisheries around Japan 



The krill fishery in Japanese waters primarily targets the 
North Pacific krill (Euphausia pacifica), which reaches a size of about 2 cm. The annual catch is of the order of 60   70,000 tonnes. Minor fisheries for Euphausia nana (a few thousand tonnes) and Thysannoessa inermis (a few hundred tonnes annually) also exist. The fishing ground are all above the 
continental shelf close to the coast and at most 200 m deep. E. nana reaches only 1.2 cm, and T. inermis can grow to 3 cm.


E. pacifica was fished as early as the 19th century. Fishing is done with small boats. The traditional technique uses bow-mounted trawls, augmented by fish pumps since the 1980s. A bow-mounted trawl can exploit only surface swarms of krill up to a depth of about eight metres. In the 1970s, the krill fishery expanded drastically and began to use also one- or two-boat 
seines, which can catch swarms as deep as 150 m. A peak in the krill production was reached in 1992 with over 100,000 tonnes. The following year, catch regulations were enforced, and since then the annual catch has been reduced by about 30%.




 Experimental fisheries 



Small-scale fisheries for krill also exist in other areas. In 

Canada
, fishing for E. pacifica takes place in the 



Strait of Georgia


 off 

British Columbia
; there is a government-imposed catch limit of 500 tonnes per year. Fisheries targeting the 




Northern krill



 (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), a medium-sized krill reaching body lengths of more than 4 cm, as well as Tysanoessa raschii (2 cm) and T. inermis in the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence and on the 
Scotian Shelf have been proposed, but didn't get beyond early experimental stages. They are limited to harvesting a few hundred tonnes of krill per year, and Nicol   Foster5 consider it unlikely that any new large-scale harvesting operations in these areas will be started due to the opposition from local fishing industries and conservation groups.




 Footnotes 




Note a:  This claim does not match the FAO and CCAMLR data at all; the Saga Sea would have caught all of the krill reported to have been caught by these agencies. Aker themselves give much more modest figures (which do match the FAO/CCAMLR data) in their 2007 quartely reports.12 For the 2007/08 season, the Saga Sea has a catch limit of 80'000 tonnes.13

 January, 1927 - October, 1943; American Broadcasting System, Inc. October, 1943 - June, 1945

WJZ Network,  Radio Group 




The Blue Network was the on-air name of an American radio production and distribution service from 1942 to 1945, which traced its formal origins back to 1927.  It was born of a divestiture, arising from anti-trust litigation, of one of the two radio networks owned by the 

National Broadcasting Company
, and is the direct predecessor of 

American Broadcasting Company
.


 Early history 


The Blue Network can, in one sense, date itself to 1923, when the 

Radio Corporation of America
 acquired 

WJZ
, Newark from 
Westinghouse (which had created the station in 1921 1) and moved it to New York City in May of that year. When RCA commenced operations of 






WRC





, Washington on 
August 1, 
1923, the root of a network was born, though it did not operate under the name by which it would later become known.  Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod states that it would not be until 1924 that the  Radio Group  formally began network operations. 2


The core stations of the  Radio Group  were RCA's stations WJZ and WRC, the 

Westinghouse
 station 






WBZ





, then in 

Springfield
, 

Massachusetts
, and 

WGY
, the 

General Electric
 station in 

Schenectady
, 





New York




. 3


RCA's principal rival prior to 1926 was the radio broadcasting department of the 
American Telephone   Telegraph Company. AT T, starting in 1921, had been using this department as a test-bed for equipment being designed and manufactured by its 

Western Electric
 subsidiary.


The RCA stations operated at a significant disadvantage to its rival chain; AT T used its own high-quality transmission lines, and declined to lease them out to competing entities, forcing RCA to use the telegraph lines of 

Western Union
, which were not as well calibrated to voice transmission as the AT T lines. 4


Nevertheless, the WJZ network sought to compete toe-to-toe with the AT T network, which was built around WEAF (today's 

WFAN
). For example, both stations sent announcer teams to cover the 





1924 Democratic National Convention




, which was held in 









Madison Square Garden








 in 

New York City
.  5 Promotional material produced in 1943 claimed certain  firsts  in broadcasting by WJZ, such as the first educational music program in April 1922, the first 





World Series




 broadcasts in 1922, and the first complete opera broadcast, 






The Flying Dutchman





, from the 
Manhattan Opera House. 6




 Creation 




RCA
 (as well as its consortium partners 

General Electric
 and 

Westinghouse
 7) were to receive a break in 1926, when 
AT T made a corporate decision to exit the broadcasting business and focus on its telecommunications business.  


The first step by AT T was to create the 
Broadcasting Company of America on 
May 15, 
1926, to hold its broadcasting assets.  As reported in the press, this move was due to the growth in the radio broadcasting activities of AT T and the special issues related thereto,8 though it would appear that subsequent activities in disposing of the assets of BCA may have also played a role in the decision.  AT T did in fact subsequently sell 

WEAF
 to RCA for $1 million in July 1926,9 a price that newspaper reports indicated was a substantial premium over what other stations were commanding in the marketplace,10 and represented a recognition of the status of WEAF in broadcasting, as well as its access to AT T's lines.  Indeed, the negotiations for the sale may have taken place very shortly after the creation of BCA, as Folder 129 in the NBC History Files at the Library of Congress contains a contract of sale for WEAF dated July 1, 1926.  11  

The Oakland Tribune
 stated that 4/5ths of the purchase price of WEAF could be attributed to good-will and the line access.  12 On July 28, 1926, the Washington Post reported in a front-page story that RCA had acquired 
WCAP.  The Oakland Tribune reported the same day 13 that WCAP had departed the field, and 






WRC





 would be operating on the frequency that they had shared, which was 640 AM.


As part of the reorganization of the broadcasting assets in the wake of the acquisitions, on 
September 13, 
1926, the formation of the 

National Broadcasting Company
 was announced via newspaper advertisements, and on 
November 15, 
1926 NBC's first broadcast was made.  14  This first broadcast on November 15, 1926 marked the de facto formation by NBC of the 

Red Network
 from the WEAF network assets, using WEAF as the  key station ; this network in eventual popular image tended to broadcast the most popular entertainment programming.  RCA merged its former radio operations into NBC, and on 
January 1, 
1927, 

WJZ
 became the  key station  of the Blue Network when its network switch operations began 15; this network, again in eventual popular image, tended to place its focus more on news and public affairs programming, as well as the  sustaining,  or non-sponsored shows.


The Decatur Review (





Illinois




) for Sunday, 
December 12, 
1926 reported the following in an article describing a broadcast to be sponsored by the 











Victor Talking Machine Company










 and aired the following New Year's Day, January 1, 1927, which is a description of this first Blue Network broadcast -- note that it makes it clear that January 1, 1927 marked the debut of the Blue Network:



 TWO BIG NETWORKS:  The network to be used for the first concert will consist of a combination of chains of stations affiliated with 

WEAF
 and 

WJZ
, 

New York
.  It is also announced that this opening Victor program inaugurates a new chain system to be operated by the 

National Broadcasting Company
, with WJZ as the  key  station.  This new chain, which will be known as the  blue  network, will allow simultaneous broadcasting from WJZ through 






WBZ





, Springfield and Boston, 

KDKA
, 

Pittsburgh
, and 

KYW
, 

Chicago
.  For broadcasting of the first program, therefore, the  blue  network will be joined with the  red  network, as the WEAF chain is designated, as well as other stations in various cities.  Following the New Year's night program, the concerts will be given bi-monthly, through the  blue  nework (...) 16  


Allegedly, the colour designations came from the way the networks were represented on maps, with red lines (or pushpins) denoting the WEAF network circuits, and blue the WJZ circuits. 17




 Operations, 1927-1941 



 Cooperation with the 
Red Network 


The Red and Blue Networks shared a common pool of engineers and facilities 18, and would, on occasion, broadcast the same events.  There are two early examples, from the biggest news events of 1927.  On June 20, 1927, both of the 

NBC
 networks covered the return of 




Charles Lindbergh



 to America from his trans-Atlantic flight, star announcer 









Graham McNamee








 doing the honors.  Three months later, a combined hookup of 67 stations on the two networks presented the second 

Dempsey
-
Tunney fight, broadcast by McNamee and NBC colleague Phillips Carlin.  See Elizabeth McLeod's discussion of surviving NBC broadcast material from this era  19

Sir Harry Lauder on its NBC Blue program, December 1, 1929.  Note that the text implies that the NBC Blue, NBC Orange (West Coast) and NBC Red networks were all participating in the broadcast.





A slightly later example of cooperation came on the evening of Sunday, 
December 1, 
1929, when the famed  Laird of the Music Halls,  
Sir Harry Lauder, appeared on a coast-to-coast hookup that originated from 

KFI
 in 

Los Angeles
 (later an NBC Red station, but at this time part of NBC's West Coast  Orange Network ), but was distributed by 

WJZ
, which, as noted, was the key station of the Blue Network; advertisements suggest that certain NBC Red stations, as well as stations in the Orange Network, supplemented the network.  A description of this broadcast is contained in a 1930 pamphlet put out by the Enna Jettick Shoe Company 20; Enna Jettick sponsored the first of Lauder's performances that night on its  Enna Jettick Melodies  show, which was followed later by another performance during the time ordinarily used by 


The Collier Hour

. 21


At least as late as January 1939, in spite of the fact that by this time NBC was seeking to differentiate the images of its NBC Red and NBC Blue networks (see below), it would still arrange for special, joint broadcasts, such as a special two-hour presentation of the  Magic Key of RCA  musical program (normally an NBC Blue program, sponsored by RCA's Victor records division) entitled  Salute to 1939.  22




 Blue Network function through the mid-1930s 


Ironically, even though the Blue Network generally was not given the more popular programs, it was the network that broadcast 
Amos 'n Andy at the height of its popularity in the early 1930s, when on average over half of the nation's radio audience would tune into the show.  23  During the 1932-1933 season, Standard Oil of New Jersey (







Esso






) sponsored an unusual program, the Five-Star Theatre, which each weeknight presented a show in a different format.  The marquee show in this cycle was 
Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel, which starred 



Groucho Marx


 and 



Chico Marx


.  Considering the show's relatively early (7.30 p.m. ET) time slot, it did rather well in the ratings 24, but it could not compete with the much stronger ratings produced by Esso's arch-rival 







Texaco






, which sponsored 


Ed Wynn

 on NBC Red, and the show ended after one year.  25


More commonly, the Blue Network would operate as a quasi- farm team  for the Red Network, in terms of entertainment programs. 



Bob Hope


 (in 1935 and again in 1937), 


Jack Benny

 (in 1932), 
Fibber McGee and Molly (in 1935), and 
Information, Please! (in 1938) are all examples of shows that debuted on the Blue Network before eventually transitioning over to larger audiences on the Red Network.  26


On occasion, shows would make brief stops at NBC Blue before moving elsewhere, such as the 
Lux Radio Theatre (1934-5) and Will Rogers' program (1933), both of which would move to CBS.

CBS
.





At some level, the Blue Network was known in the late 1920s and early 1930s for its children's programming.  There are at least two volumes extant, from an Akron-based publishing house 28, which are collections of stories which purport to have been part of Blue Network programs.  A copy of one, in the collection of E.O. Costello, shows a cover with two children listening to a late 1920s-style radio, from which shimmering images of fairy-tale characters are emerging.  Other than the title (and the radio on the cover), the precise nature of the ties to the Blue Network is not known; the book does not even make direct reference to the National Broadcasting Company.  It can also be said that this is an indication that the Blue Network had a well-established identity of its own by 1929. 29




 Problems 


The descriptions of the material contained in the NBC History Files at the 

Library of Congress
 appear to indicate that at some level, there was discontent with the way 

NBC
 was managing the Blue Network vis-a-vis the Red Network.  For example, one folder in the NBC History Files 30 contains a three-page letter dated 
June 28, 
1934 from station 

WSYR
 in 

Syracuse
, 





New York




, which complains of the neglect of the Blue Network in favor of the Red Network.  This point can said to be reinforced firstly by a memorandum dated 
September 18, 
1935 31, in which the Blue complained about its lack of access to broadcasts of the 





World Series




, and secondly by a letter dated shortly after that, on 
October 5, 
1935 32, which is a communication from Hearst Radio complaining that 
Amos 'n Andy and the 








Al Pearce







 programs had been moved from the Blue Network to the Red Network, and complaining in general about the weakness of the Blue's programming.  Indeed, the NBC History Files contain 33 a February 1937 in-house memorandum so caustic of the performance of the Blue Network that the author's name was redacted from the document.


A significant issue with the NBC Blue Network may have been its size.  It started, in January 1927, with 7 stations, had grown to 17 by the end of 1929, but still had only 33 stations by 1937. 34 This would have made it significantly smaller than its rivals.  In 1938, Mutual had 107 affiliates, and CBS had 114; the Blue Network, by contrast, was not able to blanket the United States when NBC Red sold out its time, with the result that during 1937-1938, the Blue Network's revenues were generally falling, while NBC Red's increased.  35  Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod has noted that as of 1938, NBC had 23 stations in its core  Basic Red  group, and 24 in its  Basic Blue  group, with 107 stations that could be Red or Blue depending on the needs of a sponsor 36; the relative ratings (and thus revenues) for NBC Red programs versus NBC Blue counterparts suggests that sponsors chose to use Red more often than Blue.




 Image 


Perhaps more in line with the common perception of the Blue Network as a smaller, but more high-brow and public affairs-centered network 37, was the fact that it was the original home of the 





NBC Symphony Orchestra




 broadcasts, led by Maestro 



















Arturo Toscanini


















 38. In a similar vein, one of the Blue Network's longest running programs was America's Town Meeting of the Air, a current-affairs discussion program.  39   Both 











Lowell Thomas










 and 

Walter Winchell
's news programs were also broadcast over the Blue Network. Both of these shows were the Blue's highest rated programs in the late 1930s and early 1940s.  40  In an interesting variation on the talent shows hosted by 








Major Bowes







, the 

Sherwin-Williams
 paint company sponsored the 
Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air for a number of years on Sunday afternoons in the 1930s and 1940s, in which singers competed for a chance to win contracts with the famed opera troupe. 41  
The National Farm and Home Hour, a show backed for many years by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was one of the Blue Network's standout daytime programs, and would be a part of its lineup from 1929 until March 1945, when the program shifted to 

NBC
.  42

NBC Symphony Orchestra




, the 
Metropolitan Opera broadcasts were a prestige program on NBC Blue, and the opera broadcasts would remain with the Blue Network after its split with 

NBC
.





Along with the 





NBC Symphony Orchestra




 broadcasts, the broadcasts of the performances of the Metropolitan Opera Company were part of the  crown jewels  of NBC Blue.  A sober, dignified pamphlet issued by the network in 1937 43 stated that the broadcasts were under 

RCA
 sponsorship, and  [t]hrough the medium of nationwide NBC Network broadcasting, Grand Opera has been given to the entire nation.  No longer is it reserved for the privileged few -- now even the most isolated listeners throughout the United States are able to enjoy the world's finest music at their own firesides.  The National Broadcasting Company (...) is proud to be the means of bringing the Metropolitan Opera to American radio listeners.   The pamphlet notes that 78 stations broadcast these opera performances in 1937, and that reception for the program was  nationwide,  something moderately unusual for an NBC Blue broadcast.


Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod has suggested, aside from a brief period where NBC Red and NBC Blue had different chime-sequences in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the two networks were *not* differentiated for many years, which would certainly be consistent with the roster of shows described above.  She points out, with some justice, that NBC Red also broadcast a number of high-brow programs such as 


















The Voice of Firestone

















, 


The Atwater Kent Hour

, and the Cities Service Concert.  Furthermore, she points out that until the 1936-1937 period, the  back office  support for the networks was the same44, and often stations would shift from one network to another, depending on sponsor needs 45.  It was only when the 

Federal Communications Commission
 began investigating network practices, McLeod believes, that efforts were made by 

RCA
 to differentiate the two networks, and to fully position NBC Blue as a high-brow/public affairs network.  (In the same light, it has been suggested that the congressional pressure was the real reason the NBC Symphony Orchestra was created.) 46 


The NBC History Files at the 

Library of Congress
 lend support to the notion that 

NBC
 was gradually groping for a way to differentiate the Red Network from the Blue Network.  For example, they contain a confidential memorandum, dated 
May 13, 
1936, which sets forth a network policy against mixing the Red and Blue network stations.47 (Compare and contrast this with the way the Harry Lauder broadcast of 1929 was handled, above.)  There also exists an October 1938 sales force memorandum, which contains talking points on how to differentiate the Blue Network from the Red Network and 

CBS
.48 Even as far back as December 1932, NBC had set forth a policy banning specific references not only to CBS, but even to the Red Network 49.


Of note is the fact that NBC began to step up efforts to expand the network; while it had 33 stations in 1937, this total had nearly tripled by January 1941, when the network had 92 stations coast to coast. 50


In the months leading up to the January 1942 spinoff of the Blue Network, 

NBC
 undertook vigorous steps to create separate brand images for the Red and Blue Networks.  To a certain extent, this had been going on since at least the summer of 1939, when Time magazine indicated that NBC was undertaking an extensive build-up of NBC Blue.  51 In both the fall of 1937, and the fall of 1941, NBC would specifically identify a program as being broadcast on the  Red Network of the National Broadcasting Company,  and at least in the fall of 1941, would have a similar tag for the Blue Network.  52 An example of this buildup comes in  Alice in Sponsor-Land,  a publication put out by 

RCA
 some time in mid-1941 53 to market that network's shows.  54 This book focuses squarely on the Red Network, describing its entertainment programming, without any reference to the Blue Network.  55  Above the lineup of stations 56 in the back of the volume is the tag-line:  This is the Red Network of the 
National Broadcasting Company.  In addition, throughout the book are slogans such as  Any time is Good Time on 

NBC
 Red!  This book, in part, demonstrates exactly how 

NBC
 differentiated the Red Network from the Blue Network in the fall of 1941, when, as noted, the Blue Network was still a part of 

NBC
.



 Programming, 1935-1941 


What follows are some examples of the programming on NBC Blue that illustrate the gradual shift in tone.


The official website for 


Helen Hayes

 57 shows a number of programs that she did for NBC Blue during this time, including a 


Eugene O'Neill

 play cycle in August 1937, two different dramatic series of her own in 1935-1936 (one sponsored by 








General Foods







), and an appearance on a Blue series in 1940, one which brought famous people who would explain why a particular book has been their favorite.


The  preview  section of the 
November 28, 
1938 edition of 

Time
 58 gives some idea of the kind of programming that the Blue Network carried.  On Friday, November 25th at 4 p.m., it carried a speech by then-






Secretary of State





 

Cordell Hull
.  Later that night, it carried the welterweight championship fight from 









Madison Square Garden








, followed by Wagnerian opera from Chicago's Lyric Opera.  Saturday, November 26 shows that the Blue carried both the 
Army-Navy football game and the NBC Symphony Orchestra.  The Town Meeting of the Air on Thursday night carried a debate among economists as to whether an economic plan for world peace was possible.





1939

Dorothy Thompson





.  Thompson, in the 1930s, was not merely a pioneering woman journalist, but one of the most influential shapers of public opinion of her era.  In a 1939 cover story, Time Magazine cited her, along with Eleanor Roosevelt, as being the most influential women in America. 59  Thompson was a major figure on NBC Blue news broadcasts and news commentaries, and would continue as a featured commentator on the Blue Network.  Collection of E.O. Costello





For one season in the early 1940s, a high-profile sponsored program on the Blue was The 

Cavalcade of America
, a show dramatizing historical events which was sponsored by 

DuPont
.  The show, which debuted in 1935 on CBS and moved to the Blue in January 1940 60, was created at a time when the firm was under attack for being, in effect, a  merchant of death,  and this show, which focused on American historical figures, was one way DuPont tried to burnish its image 61.  Certainly, the show had high production values, as can be witnessed by its use of 


Raymond Massey

 for a show in February 1940 on 



Abraham Lincoln


, as described in the 
February 26, 
1940 issue of Time 62.  It was also known for the use of university professors to vet the historical accuracy of the stories, as well as scripts by future Pulitzer Prize-winner 




Arthur Miller



 63.  (This show would eventually stay with NBC Red and NBC, starting in 1941, and the network would continue to broadcast the show even into the age of television 64.)


A poignant example of the Blue Network's counterprogramming comes on the night of Sunday, 
May 4, 
1941.  The network carried an address by exiled 



Lithuania


n president 


Antanas Smetona

 at 7.45 p.m., where he was addressing a mass rally in 

Chicago
.  Given that NBC Red was, at the same time, broadcasting the popular Fitch Bandwagon radio program (on right after 


Jack Benny

), one wonders how many people tuned in to hear this statesman speak of the tragic fate of his nation.  65


An interesting perspective can be seen on one of the most dramatic days in the history of network radio.  On the morning/afternoon of the 
Japanese attack on 


Pearl Harbor

 on 
December 7, 
1941, while the first attack wave was over 

Oahu
, NBC Blue was broadcasting The Inspector General, as part of its Great Plays program, while NBC Red was broadcasting a program with popular bandleader 














Sammy Kaye













.  At 4 p.m., ET, the Blue's broadcasts of the National Vespers was interrupted by various news reports.  Later on in the evening, at 6.30 p.m. and 6.45 p.m., 
Drew Pearson's and 
Eleanor Roosevelt's regular broadcasts are heard, followed at 7 p.m. by a news roundup show that competed with Jack Benny, and later on Bible Week opposite the Chase and Sanborn Hour with 


Edgar Bergen

.  (The Blue did have the popular 
Inner Sanctum mystery anthology series later that night at 8.30, followed in turn by its number one show with 

Walter Winchell
.)  Lastly, of interest to those who may recall the satiric references in 



Warner Bros.


 cartoons of the era, at 10 p.m., the Blue carried The Goodwill Hour with John J. Anthony, dispensing advice to those who sought it, and who presumably were not tuned into 







Phil Spitalny






's orchestra on the Red network.  66





 Proposed sale 


In light of subsequent events, it is most interesting that 

NBC
 seriously considered, during the late 1930s, disposing of the Blue Network on its own initiative.  There are substantial materials contained in the NBC History Files at the 

Library of Congress
 67 on this point.  The fact that 

David Sarnoff
, the head of 

RCA
, was involved in these discussions indicates the high level at which this proposal was given consideration.  A plain reading of the finding guide at the Library of Congress on the NBC History Files does not disclose the precise nature of these discussions, though the fact that these discussions existed is of interest.  In 1943, after the Blue Network had been spun off (but before its eventual sale), a promotional publication noted that: 
 As far back as 1932, a group of executives of the 

National Broadcasting Company
 conceived the idea that The Blue Network could progress faster and serve its stations, its advertisers and the listening public much better if, instead of being a part of NBC it were to become an independent network.  68 





 Divestiture, 1940-1943 



 Initial moves by the FCC 


During the 1930s, accusations were leveled at both 

NBC
 and 

CBS
, in part by its rival 

Mutual
, that the two senior network systems engaged in a series of anticompetitive activities, by locking up talent through in-house talent bureaus, and tightly tying together the system of affiliated stations through onerous contracts.


In June 1940, after some years of study, the 

Federal Communications Commission
 (which had had oversight over radio broadcasting since 1934) issued a scathing report (the  Report on Chain Broadcasting ) attacking the affiliation policies of NBC and CBS, as well as the talent booking agency practices.  The report proposed limiting each network to one affiliated station per city, which would have had a direct impact on NBC's dual-network ownership 69.  In May 1941, the FCC went a step further and issued formal rules to break up what it perceived to be monopolies in radio; one of these rules specifically barred a network from operating more than one hookup, which would have been aimed directly at NBC's ownership of its two networks, in a manner even more explicit than the June 1940 report 70.




 Litigation against NBC 


Subsequent congressional hearings in the fall of 1941 resulted in the 

FCC
 watering down the rules, but the reprieve was short-lived, as the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, on 
December 31, 
1941, filed an antitrust action against 

NBC
 and 

CBS
, seeking to break up the networks' methods of operation.  

Mutual
, at the same time, filed an antitrust suit of its own, in the amount of $10.275 million, according to the 
January 12, 
1942 edition of 

Time
 71.


This account by Time 72 describes at least one of the accusations leveled against NBC by Mutual, from an affidavit by Mutual's general manager.  In the fall of 1941, Mutual debuted a comedy-variety series sponsored by 
Ballantine Ale, called Three Ring Time, starring 

Milton Berle
 and 


Charles Laughton

.  73  The show was set to debut on a 77-station network, but 14 of these stations were under contract to NBC, which had the power to exercise options on the most desirable time, in cities where there was limited competition.  NBC eventually exercised options for six of these stations, with the result that Three Ring Time was being carried simultaneously on NBC Blue and Mutual.





This 1941 advertisement 74, demonstrates how NBC was identifying the Blue Network in advertisements in the months leading up to the spinoff; in this case, for a highly popular and long-running (1933-1968) morning show starring 
Don McNeill.  The tagline would be used not only for the rest of the Blue Network's existence, but, as will be seen, will be used well into the late 1940s.





While the antitrust suits were pending, NBC and CBS had appealed to the courts regarding the ability of the FCC to regulate the operations of radio networks. 75 While these appeals were in progress, NBC started the process of formally separating the operations of the Red Network and the Blue Network, a process which had begun in 1939 with the formation of a separate sales department for the Blue Network and which continued into 1940 and 1941 with the formation of other departments for the Blue Network 76.  NBC began to specifically identify the networks, contrary to its general practice, and began to divide personnel and facilities; eventually, it formed a separate corporate entity for the Blue Network on 
January 9, 
1942,  Blue Network Company, Inc.  77  From this date on, while NBC still maintained ownership of the Blue Network, its was for most purposes an entirely separate network. NBC Red at this point became known as simply NBC.  78





This 1944 advertisement 79, while it dates from after the sale by 

NBC
 of the Blue Network, shows how the Blue Network continued to have access to NBC facilities; in this case, the famed radio studios at 








Rockefeller Center







 in 

New York City






In June 1942 the 

United States Supreme Court
 upheld the jurisdiction of the FCC over the issuance of rules relating to chain broadcasting. While the FCC litigation continued in the wake of this ruling, the public and private antitrust litigation was held in abeyance.  80


On 
May 10, 
1943 the Supreme Court (
National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190) upheld the right of the FCC to regulate practically everything that was radio, by sustaining the jurisdiction of the FCC to regulate the contractual relations of the major networks with affiliated stations. 81  Efforts in late 1943 before the Senate 
Interstate Commerce Committee to obtain legislation to, in effect, reverse the decision went nowhere.




 Sale 


The 
January 11, 
1943 edition of Time states that 7 investment houses, 3 insurance companies, 2 manufacturers, a daily newspaper and an industrialist had all taken serious looks at purchasing the network 82 However, with the ruling from the 

Supreme Court
, NBC was now spurred to take vigorous action to sell the Blue Network. The bidding came down to three groups, with an initial bid of $6 million, which was raised in sequence by rivals to $6.5 and then $7 million.  In late July, 1943, the investment banking firm of Dillon, Read   Co. made a bid of $7.8 million. 83


On 
July 30, 
1943, just over two months after the court's ruling, 

RCA
 announced the sale of the network to American Broadcasting System, Inc., a firm controlled by 
Edward J. Noble, a former undersecretary of commerce who was better known as the chairman of Life Savers Corp.  The price was announced as $8 million.  84  This was followed by a petition to the 

FCC

 FCC hearings 


One of the significant issues surrounding the sale of the Blue Network involved the network's practices regarding  controversial  topics and proponents.  The network, citing the code of the 







National Association of Broadcasters






, declined to sell time to labor organizations, cooperatives, and other organizations advocating  controversial topics,  but did give them free air time, provided there was an opportunity for the other side to be heard.  On 
August 27, 
1943, the 

Congress of Industrial Organizations
 filed a brief in a petition to intervene in the 

FCC
 proceedings on the network sale. 86 The CIO complained that the NAB code regarding  controversial  broadcasts inhibited its ability to buy airtime.  While the FCC denied the CIO's petition to intervene, it did invite the CIO to give testimony in the hearings. 87


At the hearings held on 
September 10, 
1943, FCC Chairman James L. Fly roundly denounced the policy of the Blue Network in refusing to sell airtime, but granting air time for free, to proponents of controversial broadcasts.  He colorfully described the policy as chasing would-be purchasers from the front of the shop, but  directing them to the back door for a handout.   Mark Woods, the head of the Blue Network, defended the policy, stating that it was in compliance with the NAB code. 88  When Edward J. Noble testified at the hearings held on 
September 20, 
1943, he was questioned closely by Chairman Fly as to the policies regarding the refusal to sell air time to labor organizations, cooperatives and other special interest groups.  89  Noble was directed by Chairman Fly at this hearing to submit a statement as to what the policy would be of the Blue Network in terms of  the expansion of the mechanisms of free speech.   90  On 
October 3, 
1943, Noble released a letter to the FCC in which it was stated that the Blue Network would meet  with an open mind  all requests for broadcasting time,  considering each on the merits,  and excluding none on the basis of ideas or personality.  91 Certainly, not all were pleased by Chairman Fly's stance.  Columnist David Lawrence, in his 
October 7, 
1943 column, thought that the FCC had overstepped its authority in attempting to force the Blue Network to change its policies regarding the sale of airtime.  92


Noble's written response seems to have been sufficient.  The sale was approved by the FCC on 
October 12, 
1943.  93 Noble was forced to divest himself of 

New York
 station 

WMCA
, which he had owned since 1940, but his 
American Broadcasting System, Inc., the entity formed to be the parent of the Blue Network, acquired 

WJZ
, additional stations in 

Chicago
 and 

San Francisco
, as well as land-line leases, certain studio facilities and leased studio facilities, and the affiliation system.   See, inter alia, the 1944 Britannica Book of the Year, op. cit. 




 Anti-trust conclusion 







Following the sale, the 

Department of Justice
 dropped its antitrust proceedings against 

NBC
 on 
October 17, 
1943 95, having previously dropped proceedings against 

CBS
 on October 11th, and the federal courts, upon its motion, dismissed 

Mutual
's antitrust claims against CBS and NBC.  96





 Changes, 1943-1945 


In the 
April 21, 
1947 issue of 

Time
 97, Mark Woods called the Blue Network of 1942 (that is, just before the sale)  a dump.   The article describes the then-116 station network as the home of cast-off speeches and classical music, which had only generated $14 million in revenue.  It could, perhaps, be argued that Woods was denigrating the state of the Blue Network at that time, to contrast with the relative success of the network later in the 1940s; this is possible in light of the fact that the Blue Network had been profitable in 1942. 98  Woods and the rest of the management team, after the sale to Noble, began to take steps to make the Blue Network more competitive with NBC and CBS.



 Finances and ownership 


An early step was to obtain a deep pocketed backer.  Noble, on 
December 28, 
1943, sold a 12.5% stake to Time, Inc. 99, and a similar stake to advertising executive Chester LaRoche, for $500,000 each. Smaller stakes were taken by Blue Network executives Mark Woods (president) and Edgar Kobak (executive vice-president, who would the next year leave the Blue for 

Mutual
). 100





Advertisement 101 promoting a broadcast of the long-running NBC Blue, Blue Network and ABC public affairs program,  Town Meeting of the Air.   Note that even at this late date, in 1947 (i.e. 20 months after the official change), ABC is still using the Blue Network tag for certain promotional purposes.







 Programming 


During the 1943-1945 period, the Blue Network used many of the NBC broadcasting facilities, including the Radio City facilities in New York (see the KATE ad, above), as well as studio space in Los Angeles.  The back of the ticket for  Fun Valley , a show starring veteran comedian Al Pearce, sponsored by Dr. Pepper and broadcast on Sunday afternoons in 1944, makes reference to both Blue Network Company, Inc. and the National Broadcasting Company, Inc. in terms of the rules and regulations audience members had to obey.  102


Of obvious import were steps taken to preserve the best programming the network had, and make improvements; these were happening in the period immediately prior to, and following, the sale of the network.  While the Blue Network did lose a few programs to 

NBC
, such as 


Quiz Kids

 and 







Duffy's Tavern






 (more shows that debuted or had a previous run on the Blue; see Lackmann, op. cit.) and the 





NBC Symphony Orchestra




 (Lackmann, op. cit.), it did retain one highly-rated show, the Jergen's Journal with 

Walter Winchell
, which managed to compete successfully with NBC's powerhouse Sunday night lineup (it was the 11th-ranked program for all of 1943-1944, and Blue's only program in the top 20 103).  The Blue Network also retained the rights to broadcast the performances of the New York 
Metropolitan Opera; 

Milton Cross
 would be the host for NBC, Blue, 

ABC
, 

CBS
, and the opera's own broadcasts from 1931 through 1975.  This was in spite of the fact that NBC did not want to assign the rights to either the Town Meeting of the Air or the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts to the Blue Network.  104


In an interview with 

Time
 published on 
January 11, 
1943, Woods noted that the Blue Network was seeking to differentiate itself from NBC and CBS by the aggressive use of transcriptions, contrary to the practice of the larger networks.105 This would have its full fruition when 




Bing Crosby



 started transcribing his prime-time shows later in the decade.


In certain respects, the Blue made attempts to grab the spotlight with unusual broadcasts.  On 
December 25, 
1942, 
the Coca-Cola Company sponsored an all-day broadcast on the network, a  Victory Parade's Christmas Party of Spotlight Bands  106.  The hiring, in 1943, of noted bandleader 


Paul Whiteman

 as Director of Music was an attempt by the network, in its own words, to strengthen the entire musical schedule, as well as obtain a prominent figure. 107  The  Metropolitan Auditions of the Air,  discussed above, had moved to the Blue Network by 1943 as well, joining the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  108

News continued to be a priority for the network; indeed, Raymond Swing would win a 

Peabody Award
 for the network in 1944 for his news commentary 109.  A 1943 promotional pamphlet listed Martin Agronsky, Drew Pearson, Swing, Lowell Thomas, Dorothy Thompson and Walter Winchell, among others, as part of  the most impressive roster of news analysts and commentators on the air today.  110 Newsman George Hicks was on a landing craft heading to the Normandy invasion beaches on D-Day when it was strafed by enemy planes, the sound of the combat being broadcast 111.  The network did have some difficulty with its news commentators during the war, however. The February 22, 1943 edition of Time notes that Woods had to clamp down on both Winchell and 
Drew Pearson for over-aggressive name calling in their broadcasts, much to the dismay of Winchell, for one. 112



 Specific Blue Network programs 


While space limitations prevent a detailed overview of all of the programming on the Blue Network during its 1943-1945 period, there are a few examples of programming that can be cited to show how the Blue was striving to reach beyond its previous reputation, and compete head-on with CBS and NBC as a stand-alone network.


1944 souvenir booklet for the Blue Network audience participation show  Ladies Be Seated,  which would continue to have a multi-year run on ABC radio. This show was also one of the very first programs to be televised by ABC.  A script survives from a February 25, 1945 local broadcast over 






WRGB





, the Schenectady, New York television station of 

General Electric
, hosted by Johnny Olson.  The network is referred to in the script as being  The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company.  113





One ambitious broadcast, copies of which are generally available to collectors of old-time radio broadcasts, was a special two-hour program broadcast on Christmas Day, 1944.  Entitled  Christmas on the Blue,   the show was emceed by 


Gracie Fields

, and featured, among other stars, 
Joe E. Brown, 

The Andrews Sisters
, 


Ed Wynn

, 


Paul Whiteman

 and others.  The show also featured broadcasts of overseas servicemen talking to their loved ones at home, something slightly unusual for the era.


One of the pairings on this special program involved 

Wendell Niles
, a long-time announcer on many radio shows, including Bob Hope's.  The Blue Network gave him and partner Don Prindle a comedy series,  Niles and Prindle,   which is referenced in the special as being scheduled for a debut the following month.  Little can be found regarding this show, other than it involved two friends  who argued about everything,  and had a brief life in 1945.  114  It was certainly most unusual for the Blue to attempt to convert a long-time announcer into a featured comedy star, and in this sense,  Niles and Prindle,  if not unique (given that 









Graham McNamee








 was the  Perfect Foil  to 


Ed Wynn

), it must be said to be at least quite singular.


Of some interest to animation fans is the existence of a show called Nitwit Court, which sought to do to John J. Anthony's The Goodwill Hour what 


It Pays to Be Ignorant

 did to 
Information, Please!.  Host Ransom Sherman would pose problems to a jury consisting of 
Arthur Q. Bryan, as  Willow,  a man with a lisp, 

Mel Blanc
, as  Hornblower,  a fumbling motorboat owner, and 

Sara Berner
 as  Bubbles Lowbridge,  a not terribly bright woman. 115





 Affiliate growth 





Matchbooks advertising the Blue Network affiliated stations in Indianapolis and Cleveland, from between 1943 (when WJW joined the Blue Network) and 1945.  Collection of E.O. Costello.





Strengthening the affiliate station group was a third matter of importance to the network.  While the network had 116 stations in January 1942 and 155 stations as of June 1943, this still meant that it could only offer to advertisers coverage of approximately 76% of the radio homes in the United States. 116  In this sense, the moves by the 

FCC
 to loosen the provisions of the contracts binding affiliated stations to networks helped the Blue.  This allowed the Blue Network to pick up a few additional stations in 1944, including (ironically) a few from 

Mutual
 117 This was one of its priorities, as in general the Blue Network had inherited smaller and less powerful stations than the group of stations that had made up its former twin sister network.




 Rebranding 





Advertisement 118 announcing the June 15, 1945 debut broadcast of the American Broadcasting Company.  An accompanying article notes that the network had been using the ABC name for some months previously.





Finally, a major priority of the Blue Network was to form a new identity, one that would mark a break with the past.  On June 15, 1945, the Blue Network formally changed its name to the 

American Broadcasting Company
 119, having initially sought permission from the 

FCC
 for this action in October 1944 120; prior to this time, some broadcasts would refer to the network as being  The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company.  121  They were not alone in desiring this catchy acronym.  122 Two prior claimants were bought out prior to June, 1945 123, and in negotiations with the Associated Broadcasting Corp. in December 1945, it acquired the rights to the name  ABC  from yet a third party 124.  From June 1945 forward, the entity has been known generally as the 

American Broadcasting Company
, and reference should be made to that entry for its subsequent history,


Of course, things are never all that simple.  The souvenir program for the  Maurice B. Sachs Amateur Hour  broadcast of Sunday, September 30, 1945 refers to the broadcast as coming from  Blue Network Studio A.   125  Even into 1947, in some markets, ABC would promote its shows with the tag-line  It's a Blue Network Program!  126





 Television 


As of June 1945, commercial television in the United States had been frozen, owing to the lower level of priorities given to it as compared to war work. Furthermore, 

ABC
 was generally slow to move into television broadcasting. It did not acquire a television station until 1948, forcing it to lease time from the stations owned by the 

DuMont
 network, including 
WABD, DuMont's flagship station.  127  It might be supposed that the Blue Network never existed in television, but as noted above, the Blue Network did make at least one known foray into television, prior to the June 1945 name change.


The script for a February 25, 1945 broadcast of Ladies Be Seated, which was a relatively popular audience-participation/stunt 
game show on Blue Network radio, still exists, and is reprinted in full in Ritchie. 128; it is, in fact, the script for the first broadcast 129.  It was hosted by 

Johnny Olson
, who would later become the long-running announcer on CBS's 

The Price Is Right
. Technically, this was not a network broadcast, as it was broadcast locally on 






WRGB





, the General Electric television station in Schenectady, New York. However, the opening title card, according to the script, was for  The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company.   No video copy of this broadcast is known to exist.




 Blue Network stations 


As noted above, during the 1930s and 1940s, the Blue Network was divided into groups of stations.  The core group of stations was known as  Basic Blue,  and covered the 
Northeast United States/


New England

 and portions of the 






Upper Midwest





, around the 
Great Lakes area. The Southern Blue Network covered the 





Deep South




, the Mountain Blue Group the 
Mountain states, the Pacific Coast Blue Network the 
Pacific Coast states, and the 
Southwestern Blue Group the Oklahoma-Texas region.


A pamphlet published by the American Rolling Mill Co. in connection with a radio talk on  The Miracle of Steel  given on the Blue Network on April 9, 1939 has a listing of the Blue Network stations participating in this broadcast. 130  They are as follows:





  Basic Blue  WJZ New York, WBZ Boston, WBZA Springfield, WEAN Providence, WICC Bridgeport, WFIL Philadelphia, WBAL Baltimore, WMAL Washington, WSYR Syracuse, WHAM Rochester, WEBR Buffalo, KDKA Pittsburgh, WHK Cleveland, WSPD Toledo, WXYZ Detroit, WOWO Ft. Wayne, WENR Chicago, KWK St. Louis, WMT Cedar Rapids, WTCN Minneapolis-St. Paul, KSO Des Moines, KOIL Omaha, WREN Kansas City and WLW Cincinnati.







  Southern Blue  WMPS Memphis, WSGN Birmingham, WAGA Atlanta, WDSU New Orleans, and WJBO Baton Rouge







  Rocky Mountain Blue  KVOD Denver, KLO Ogden, and  KUTA Salt Lake City







  Pacific Coast Blue  KGO San Francisco, KECA Los Angeles, KEX Portland, KJR Seattle, KGA Spokane, KFSD San Diego and KTMS Santa Barbara







  Southwestern Blue  KTOK Oklahoma City, KGKO Ft. Worth-Dallas, and KXYZ Houston.




Other Blue Network basic stations in 1939 were WABY (Albany, NY); WJTN (Jamestown, NY); WRTD (Richmond, VA); WLEU (Erie, PA); CFCF (Montreal, Quebec) and WMFF 131

 This was a dramatic program broadcast on Thursday nights at 7.05 EWT during the 1943-1944 season, set in a boardinghouse in wartime Washington, D.C., with Landis playing the housekeeper, and Holm the daughter of a senator, who in turn was played by 
Douglas Holm.

P1.1-billion IPO


On January, 2008, 
Viva Films chairman Vic del Rosario announced that Viva Communications expects to raise P1.1 billion (1 US dollar = 41.48 pesos) through approval of the 
initial public offering (IPO) by the 


Philippine Stock Exchange

, on listing date of March 5. It plans to sell up P 92.8 million new shares and P 49.9 million secondary shares at P 12.93 / share (offer is 35% of the company's issued and outstanding

net income was P 121 million for January to October, 2007, double its 2006 earnings and projects net profit of P 330 million this year.2




Stable outlook


On 
February 1, 
2008, 


Fitch Ratings

 announced:  The Outlook on BDOU's ratings is stable given a benign economic environment. And while integration risk is a factor, a successful merger of the two banks will provide ratings momentum, if combined with some capital strengthening in particular; BDO will particularly benefit from EPCI's good franchise among commercial entities and consumers, and well developed operations in fee-generating areas such as trust banking, remittances and credit cards. Significant revenue and cost synergies should arise from the integration of the two banks, due to complete by mid-2008, as led by BDO's very competent and driven management;  BDO will raise P 10 billion of Tier 2 capital, and boosting its capital adequacy ratio by 2 percent to 3 percent; With the completion of the merger, BDOU will have a network of 680 branches and 1,200 automated teller machines. 3




Lehman Brothers' exposure


On 
September 17, 2008, 

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
 Governor Amando Amando M. Tetangco, Jr. announced  due to the uncertainty relating to the financial condition of Lehman Brothers, Banco de Oro Unibank Inc. is setting aside provisions totalling 3.8 billion pesos (80.9 million dollars) to cover its exposure to said entity.  Banco de Oro failed to disclose the extent of its exposure to Lehman paper, stating  only that its balance sheet should be adequately covered from potential losses arising from its Lehman exposure. The provisions will come from reallocation of excess reserves and from additional provisions in the current period.  Banco de Oro, capitalised at P 89.8 billion, closed 15.4% down to P 33.456  Banco de Oro Unibank said, however, on 
September 19  it had a total exposure of $ 134 million to bankrupt U.S. investment bank 

Lehman Brothers
: This represents the face value of securities held by the bank. Prior to Sept. 15, 2008, this exposure had been reduced through mark-to-market adjustments and hedging transactions.  The BSP data revealed Banco de Oro set aside a 
buffer equivalent to 60% of its exposure.78





Notes





The new Banco de Oro will retain the ticker symbol of the old Banco de Oro.  1.3 billion BDO shares will be issued in exchange for 727 million Equitable PCI Bank shares, which will be de-listed on 
June 4, 
2007.

Carl Assar Eugen Lindbeck (born 
January 26, 
1930) is an 
economics professor and an artist. He is still an active economist at Stockholm University and at the

insider-outsider theory of employment), the welfare state (including the effect of changing social norms), and China's  reformed economy.

He is well-known to students of economics for his quip that  
rent ceilings are the most effective means yet for destroying cities, even more effective than the 
hydrogen bomb.

Thangata is the Congolese term for work without compensation.  It was used during the Belgian colonization of the 

Congo
 when the Belgian colonists would frequently order native Congolese to do menial labor for no material gain.


Thangata was a kind of free labor provided between neighbors or tribesmen and their chief in return for future labor of the same type or for the greater good in the latter case.  When the European colonists learn of this tradition they twist it to compel Africans to work for months on the cotton plantations in return for little pay.  Before thangata the Europeans had been unable to force Africans to work on their plantations during the rainy season when most Africans would be working on their own farms.

Usha Khanna (born 1942 in 










Gwalior









) is an 

India
n music director. Regarded as the only established female music director in the 
Indian film industry, she remained active for more than 3 decades from 1960s to 1980s. She is still active making some music for some movies and television-serials, more than 40 years after her debut as music director in 

Dil Deke Dekho
 (1959). She received a 










Filmfare









 nomination for composing the songs for the huge hit film 

Souten
 (1983). 


Biography


Usha Khanna's father, Manohar Khanna, was a lyricist and singer, but she had no formal training in music. Even though she did often take inspiration from 





Arabic music




, which she liked. Usha claims that she has never lifted of any song directly, but that she has composed something along the lines.


The popular music director 


O. P. Nayyar

 introduced Usha Khanna to meet 






Sashadhar Mukherjee





, a powerful man in the Indian film industry at that time. She sang a song for Mukerji, and when he realised that she had composed the song on her own, he told her to compose two songs per day for one year. After a few months, Mukherjee signed her as the composer for his movie 

Dil Deke Dekho
 (1959) as a music composer. The film, which also introduced the actress 

Asha Parekh
, became a big hit, and Mukherjee hired her again for another 

Asha Parekh
 starrer 

Hum Hindustani
 (1961).


After she started composing music for Hindi movies, Usha Khanna struggled to establish herself as a music director, despite producing many hit songs. She often collaborated with 



Asha Bhosle


, who referred to Usha Khanna as her daughter, and 


Mohammed Rafi

. This trio produced many hit songs.



Saawan Kumar was often the lyricist for Usha Khanna, and wrote most of his lyrics for her songs. He directed and produced the lyrics for eleven movies she scored the music for. In 1979 
K J Yesudas received 
Filmfare award for her song Dil ke tukde tukde in the film Dada. 


The effort she had put in to establish her in the industry, made her know how difficult it was to break through, and made her often give the chance to new singers. She gave the chance to the singers who were little known at that time   
Anupama Deshpande, 


Pankaj Udhas

, 







Hemlata






, 


Mohammed Aziz

, 


Roop Kumar Rathod

, 


Shabbir Kumar

, and 






Sonu Nigam





. Many of these went on to become notable singers. Usha Khanna herself also sing a few song as a playback singer.


Many of Usha Khanna's songs are still very popular. One of India's most well-known music composers, 








A. R. Rahman







, used her Har Nazar Ke Sau Afsane from 






Shabnam





 (1964), as inspiration for the song Latka Dikha Diya in the movie 


Hindustani

 (1996).


Usha Khanna was quite active as a composer until the mid-ninetees. Until now the last movie she has given music to was in 2003. The movie was 
Dil Pardesi Ho Gaya, produced and directed by her ex-husband 
Saawan Kumar who she was briefly married to.



Usha Khanna had given music to non-hindi movies too. The Malayalam movie 
Moodal Manju (1969) is still remembered for some of the finest songs in Malayalam including 'Nee Madu Pakaroo' by K. J. Yesudas and 'Manasa Mani veenayil' by S.Janaki. 
Agni nilavu and 
Puthooram puthri Unniyarcha are the other malayalam movies done by her. Why she did not get many chances remains a mystery for many music lovers even now.

Squashes and pumpkins





Atlantic Giant is a recent label for the round phenotypes of the giant 
squash (popularly called a 
pumpkin, depending upon fruit color) variety of the 
species 




Cucurbita maxima



 that was bred publicly from simple 




Hubbard



 material through intermittent efforts over the past centuries. The uniqueness of this variety lies in its production of fruits more massive than those produced by any other plant in the world. Fruit can exceed 16 feet in circumference. The heaviest Atlantic Giant on record weighed 766 kg (1689 lb) and was grown by Joe Jutras in 2007.1 Under normal conditions the Atlantic Giant can consistently produce fruits in excess of 250 kg (551 lb).   


As the germplasm of such a giant squash variety is commercially provocative, the name Atlantic Giant came from a U.S. legal protection that was granted for the rounder phenotypes. Numerous labels were created for this variety over the past two centuries. This phenotype graduated back into the public domain, retaining the Atlantic Giant label. After the Atlantic Giant right expired, an ensuing filing was made in September 1985 and accepted, purportedly for the oblong phenotypes of the variety, under a label Dill's Atlantic Giant, named after Howard Dill, who helped create the seeds.23  This 18-year right expired in 2004, leaving all phenotypes of this originally public variety back into the public domain. 


Many people use the Atlantic Giant for competitions at weighoffs and 
harvest festivals around the world. These rounder phenotypes of the giant squash variety grow larger, thus those which fell under the Dill's Atlantic Giant division are generally unused. These gardeners tend to become extraordinarily involved with their pumpkins. Because of the uncanny genetics of the material, there has been an aggressive and unimpeded increase in fruit weight per generation, and the stability of optimized genomic loci means that it is now relatively easy to grow large fruit in ordinary growing conditions.


Seeds from pumpkins that have been proven to produce big pumpkins can be sold at online auctions for considerable sums of money. The largest contest award paid for a single pumpkin was $53,000 USD to Nathan   Paula Zehr for the first 1,000 lb pumpkin (1061 lb actual weight) at the Clarence NY World Pumpkin Confederation Weigh-Off in 1996 4. The highest price paid for a single pumpkin seed was $850 for a 1068 Wallace seed in 2006 5. Numerous clubs and organizations dedicated to promoting giant pumpkin growing exist worldwide. 



Great Pumpkin Commonwealth


The Great Pumpkin Commonwealth (GPC) is the major organizer and sanctioning body[] overseeing giant pumpkin and vegetable growing in the United States of America, Canada and Europe. Now with fifty eight weigh-off locations throughout the world the GPC and its sponsored sites are attended by hundreds of thousands to the ever popular annually run festivals and weekend events held each summer and fall.

28 February 
1949






The 

Dassault
 M.D.450 Ouragan (

French
: Hurricane) was a 1940s French 
jet 
fighter-bomber aircraft. The first French designed jet fighter to enter production, the Ouragan was operated by 

Israel
, India and 

El Salvador
 as well as France, with Israeli aircraft participating both in the 





Suez Crisis




 and 



Six-Day War


. While technologically unremarkable, the Ouragan played a key role in resurgence of the French aviation industry after 







World War II






.



Design and development



As citizens of an occupied country, the French were not able to contribute significantly to the great strides made in aircraft design made during 







World War II






. After the war, aviation designer 







Marcel Dassault






 was eager to re-establish the aviation industry with an all-French jet fighter, which was outlined in 1947. The government response to the proposal was positive and prototype construction began soon after the design was finalized.1


Detailed design work on the new aircraft, which was given the designation M.D. (Marcel Dassault) 450, began in October 1947, with construction beginning on 
7 April 
1948 at Dassault's factory in 





Saint-Cloud




. A French government contract for three prototypes followed on 
7 December 
1947. The first Ouragan fighter flew on 
28 February 
1949 with Kostia Rozanoff at the controls.2 The M.D.450-01 prototype lacked 
pressurization, armament, and the distinctive wingtip fuel tanks. Powered by a 
Rolls-Royce Nene 102 
centrifugal-flow jet engine generating 22.27 kN (2,270 
kp/5,000 lbf) of 
thrust, the aircraft reached a top speed of 980 km/h (529 knots, 609 mph) and initial climb rate of 43 m/s (8,465 ft/min) in service trials in 1949. The 450 liter (118.9 US gal) wingtip tanks that would become the indelible feature of all Ouragans first appeared in December 1949. The pressurized second prototype, M.D.450-02, climbed to 15,000 m (49,213 ft), while the third prototype, M.D.450-03, was powered by a 





Hispano-Suiza




-licensed Nene 104 was used in weapons trials with 15 mm and later 20 mm cannon.


In 
31 August 
1949, 

French Air Force
 ordered 15 pre-production aircraft (later reduced to 12), which were eventually used for evaluation of various engines (including 
SNECMA Atar), armament schemes, and payloads. The contract was signed on 
15 December 
1949.3 These aircraft were to be produced at Dassault's plants outside Paris. On 
31 August 
1950, Dassault received an order for 150 production Ouragans, with an additional 200 ordered in the following years.1


Four production aircraft modified for rough-field operation with the two-wheel main landing gear with low-pressure tires retracting into a fairing added under the wing roots, and a brake parachute. The configuration was intended for operations in 

Algeria
, and the nickname came from the Arab word  baroud,  meaning  battle.  First flight 
24 February 
1954. Despite good performance, the project was abandoned in 1958 with two aircraft converted back to standard Ouragans.




Operational history



The first production Ouragan flew on 
5 December 
1951. The type entered service with the 

French Air Force
 in 1952, replacing the British 

De Havilland Vampire
. The first 50 Ouragans were built as M.D.450A with the Nene 102 engine; the rest were M.D.450B with a Hispano-Suiza-built Nene 104B engine, lighter than the Nene 102 and with slightly greater thrust. Wingtip fuel tanks were fitted as standard in both variants.





MD450 Ouragan on display with wingtip fuel tanks.





Pilots found the Ouragan to be generally pleasant to fly and a stable gun and rocket platform, although due to its short-coupled fuselage, the aircraft had a tendency to snap into a spin in tight turns. However, for two years, the Ouragon successfully performed with 

la Patrouille de France
 aerobatic team. 


In French service, the 
Dassault Mystere IV completely replaced the Ouragan by 1961. 



India



On 
25 June 
1953, India ordered 71 Ouragans with the slightly uprated Nene 105 engine, with deliveries starting that year and completed in March 1954. An additional order for 33 second-hand Ouragans in March 1957 brought the total to 104.4 The Indians named the aircraft Toofani (
Hindi: Hurricane).


The Indian Toofanis faced combat in 1961, when they performed air strikes against the Portuguese colony of 

Diu
 on the western coast of India. They were also used in ground attack missions against anti-government rebels in 





Assam




 and 





Nagaland




, and in 1962 for reconnaissance missions in the 

Sino-Indian War
. One Toofani strayed over the border with 

Pakistan
 on 24 April 1965, and was forced to land by a pair of Pakistani Sabres.  While the pilot was returned to India, the aircraft was retained and ended up being displayed at the Pakistan Air Force Museum at 

Peshawar
.5


As was the case in France, the Ouragan started to be replaced in front-line service by the 
Mystere IVA in 1957, being withdrawn fully from front line service in 1965, although it continued in use for some years as a Target Tug.5




Israel


In contrast to France and India, the 

Israeli Air Force
 was an enthusiastic Ouragan user. Seeking to augment its jet aircraft force of British 

Gloster Meteor
s, IAF initially considered French 
Dassault Mystere IIC and Canadian-built 

F-86 Sabre Mk.6
 fighters. Due to development problems with the Mystere and a Canadian embargo on the Sabres, the order was changed to Mystere IVAs, with a batch of Ouragans purchased as a stop-gap measure. By 1955, the IAF had received at least 75 aircraft, comprising a mix of newly-built and retired French Air Force examples. 


Israeli Ouragans entered combat on 
12 April 
1956, shooting down an Egyptian 

Vampire
.6 At the onset of the 





Suez Crisis




 on 
29 October 
1956, Ouragans shot down an additional four Vampires. The two documented encounters with Soviet 

Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15
 fighters (also powered by the Nene engine but with a more modern swept wing) ended with one Ouragan surviving several 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon hits to fly the next day and one MiG-15 being heavily damaged after it entered a turning 
dogfight with the Ouragans.6 The poor training of the Egyptian pilots who were consistently unable to realize their advantage in numbers as well as the MiG-15's speed and climb characteristics helped Ouragans to survive despite their inferior performance.6 On 
31 October, a pair of Ouragans armed with rockets strafed the Egyptian destroyer 



Ibrahim-el-Awal''


 (ex-HMS Mendip), resulting in the capture of the ship.


The Ouragans were relegated to advanced training shortly after the Suez Crisis, although they saw more combat in the 1967 



Six-Day War


. In 
1975, the IAF sold 18 Ouragans to 

El Salvador
, where they remained in service until the late 1980s.




El Salvador


In the wake of the 

Football War
 of 1969, El Salvador began a concerted push to modernize its air force. Unable to buy combat aircraft from the United States due to a US government arms embargo, the Salvadorans found surplus Israeli Ouragans for sale on the international arms market. These aircraft were refurbished by the Israelis and were delivered to El Salvador between 1973 and 1978.


El Salvador's Ouragans saw extensive combat during the 

Salvadoran Civil War
 of 1980-1992. Salvadoran Ouragans flew strike missions against communist FMLN forces, operating from Ilopango airport located near the capital city of San Salvador. As El Salvador is not a large country and combat radius was not a pressing concern, Salvadoran Ouragans in combat usually operated with their wingtip fuel tanks removed in order to save weight and allow for greater weapons loads. 


An FMLN sapper attack against Ilopango in 1982 destroyed several Ouragans and accelerated the push to supplant, and eventually replace, the Ouragans with American-made 
Cessna A-37 Dragonfly aircraft, which were made available after the 
Reagan Administration dropped the arms embargo. The remaining Ouragans served on for several more years, but were all retired by war's end. 


Salvadoran Ouragans have been pictured in several camouflage schemes, and it is possible that during the war the Ouragan fleet operated in colors that were never completely standardized.


At least one survivor of El Salvador's Ouragan fleet is currently on static display, at 








Ilopango







.

Ex- Black Archers  MD450 Ouragan





A number of MD.450 Ouragan examples are preserved in France including #251 and #450/ 4-US , part of the jet aircraft collection at Chateau 
Savigny-les-Beaune. The Musee de l'Air et de l'Espace at 
Le Bourget Airport has #154/  4-LT  painted in a colorful  Indian-head  scheme but a previous code is just visible under the 4-LT markings. Ouragan #214/ UG,  previously stored, is exhibited in the  Patrouille de France  paint scheme at the  Musee Europeen de l'Aviation de Chasse,  
Montelimar. Israeli Air Force Ouragan  113,  a combat veteran and survivor of the 1956 Suez War and 1967 Six-Day War, is on outdoor display at the 

Israel Air Force Museum
. An MD.450 Ouragan (Toofani),  IC 554,  is on display at the Indian Air Force Museum, Palam, New Delhi. It was painted earlier in grey-green camouflage but now appears in natural metal in No. 47  Black Archers  Squadron markings.

For the Universal Music CD series, see 
Gold (album series).
Gold is the title of many music albums. They are not 
gold albums (albums certified to have sold over a given number of copies in their country), though they may become it. They are often 
greatest hits compilations, but several are original albums. Many of those albums (esp. those released since 2005) are from 

Universal Music Group
 and are often 2-disc greatest hits.

Most, if not all, of the albums share a common layout, with a photograph of the artist below a gold bar, with a black vertical line near the right hand side, the artist's name on the left of the black line, and  Gold  on the right.

Lewis Greifer (
19 December 
1915 in 

London
, 

England
    
18 March 
2003) was a 
writer for 
television, 
film, and 
radio.

After wartime service in the RAF, he pursued a career in journalism and joined the 
London Evening Standard. He then dabbled as a writer, with sketches for 

The Goon Show
 amongst others. A strong record on television writing in the 1950s and 1960s made his career; and by 1969 he diversified somewhat and devised the panel game show 









Whodunnit!








 for the 

BBC
 (which was later reformatted and remade by 


Thames Television

 as a vehicle for 


Jon Pertwee

). 


Lewis Greifer also wrote episodes of 

The Prisoner
, 

Crossroads
, and the initial draft of the 


Tom Baker

 

Doctor Who
 story 














Pyramids of Mars













. The latter script had to be radically rewritten by script-editor 















Robert Holmes














, who decided to use the pseudonym Stephen Harris on the final product. Greifer had meanwhile returned to teach at the 
University of Tel Aviv, and had little contact with television in his remaining years.

Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky (Iwan Osipowicz Jarkowski, 1844-1902) was a Russian-Polish civil engineer.  He worked for a Russian railway company and was obscure in his own time.  Beginning in the 1970s, his work on the effects of thermal radiation on small objects in the solar system (e.g., 
asteroids) was developed into the 
Yarkovsky effect and the 
YORP effect. The 
asteroid 

35334 Yarkovsky
 is named in his honour 
 . In 1888 he also created a 





mechanical explanation of gravitation




.

For the Serbian comic book, see

Kobra is a 
fictional 
supervillain published by 

DC Comics
. He first appeared in Kobra #1 (February 1976), and was created by Martin Pasko, Steve Sherman, 

Jack Kirby
,  and 





Pablo Marcos




.



Fictional character biography


Kobra is an international 
terrorist and mad scientist who has crossed paths with the majority of Earth's costumed heroes during his attempts to usher in the 
Kali Yuga (an age of chaos). His real name is Jeffrey Franklin Burr, and he was born part of a set of  siamese twins, but was stolen at birth by the Cult of the Kobra god, since a prophecy claimed he would lead them to rule the world. Under their teaching, he became a dangerous warrior and a 
sadistic criminal mastermind. He led the cult into using advanced technology to menace the world. Followers of Kobra would frequently address their master as  Naja-Naja ,  
naja naja  being the 
binomial name for the 






Indian Cobra





. This later became  
Naga-Naga , a meaningless title which translates from the 

Sanskrit
 as  snake-snake . Whether this change was intentional or an error is not known.1


However, unknown to the cult, he had a 
psychic link to his twin brother, Jason, who knew nothing of Kobra. As a result, one felt what the other felt, including pain. Because of this, his brother was recruited by an international agency to help them combat Kobra. At first, Kobra was unable to even hurt or kill his brother; eventually, however, he used a device that  shut off  the psychic link, and gave him the chance to kill Jason. However, Kobra was subsequently haunted by visions of his brother. Whether it really was his ghost or just Kobra's imagination was never revealed. 


In subsequent years, Kobra would clash with assorted superheroes, including 
Batman whom he first met over a 

Lazarus Pit
 of his own creation, Kobra had learned to build modified Lazarus Pits which allowed him to control the minds of those he killed and resurrected. Kobra is the only person in the DC universe to ever decipher the formula for the Lazarus Pits.  Kobra had special concerns about 
Wonder Woman  and sought to ensure her death, first by hiring the Cartel led secretly by UN Crisis Bureau head 
Morgan Tracy (also 
Diana Prince's boss), then by creating a new 
Cheetah. Later his various 
Strike Force Kobra teams would fight two different incarnations of Batman's 
Outsiders. Kobra also fought the third 

Flash
, the 









Suicide Squad








 led by Amanda Waller, the original incarnation of 

Checkmate
, 


Captain Atom

, and others. Kobra is one of a very small number of individuals that has the capability of defeating Batman in hand-to-hand combat, and actually did so on one occasion.


The only organization ever to rival Kobra in the old 









DC Universe








 (

Pre-Crisis I
) was 

SKULL
, there were frequent recorded clashes between the two groups, the last occurring in Outsiders Annual #1 story  The Skull...The Serpent...and The Outsiders .


After the betrayal of his lover Eve during the Strike Force Kobra fiasco, she split Kobra in two and established her own splinter group. In the 
Power Company: Sapphire #1 the Justice League rushes to 

San Diego
 to prevent disaster as two rival factions of the Kobra Cult prepared to go to war. One faction was led by Eve the other was led by Kobra himself.


He recently kidnapped the former hero 
Air Wave and used him to seize control of the world's media and satellite resources, intending to destroy a number of major world cities. However, in a demonstration of his power, he incidentally killed Terri Rothstein, 


Atom Smasher

's mother, ensuring the 

Justice Society of America
's involvement. (Mrs Rothstein's life would later be saved through 
time travel; Arom Smasher replacing her with the villain 
Extant).


He appeared again in JSA #45, which featured his trial. He shrugged off claims of terrorism, claiming to be an enlightened soul (a 
bodhisattva) trying to free souls from their karmic debt by random acts of violence. Following this, his followers threatened to kill the media outside the courthouse with 
bioengineered 
suicide bomb 
implants. Holding everyone hostage with this tactic, the JSA allowed him to escape, leading to an outraged 
Black Adam and Atom Smasher, that both subsequently choose to leave the team. In JSA #51, Atom Smasher, Black Adam, 






Northwind





 and 
Brainwave tracked Kobra down to his headquarters in the 


Himalaya Mountains

, where they killed his guards, and Black Adam ripped his heart out.



Legacy





Kobra Blackadders vs Checkmate Knight






 However, the organization Kobra survived this, and has been gaining converts. In 








Identity Crisis







, it was revealed that DCU prisoners (such as 
Slipknot) sometimes convert to the cult of Kobra, to the general disgust of the DC's superheroes.  


 Like 
















Ra's al Ghul















, Kobra owned a hidden network of very specialized 

Lazarus Pit
s.


 Kobra apparently entertains many specialized sub-sections. One such section was the Blackadders, a group of ninja-like fanatics. In the past Kobra operated an aggressive metahuman research and recruitment program, this program that gave birth to both known versions of 
Strike Force Kobra.


 Kobra is currently active in the DCU as a terrorist organization with a religious bent. Upon the death of Burr, it underwent a power-struggle, with would-be leaders including 
King Snake, and (unwillingly) a schoolfriend of 






















Tim Drake





















 who apparently fitted the prophecy, but this has apparently settled: a new leader has emerged (possibly Eve who had split off with half of the old school Kobra). Under her, the organization now seeks to fulfill 'the prophecies of Kali Yuga'. It is actively being fought by the super-spy agency known as 

Checkmate
.


 The new Kobra seems to be ranked by serpent type, low level members are 
Lanceheads, higher level members are called 
Nagas (Checkmate vol. 2 #4), the highest level shown are the Bestowed, 
mystics who specialize in Blood Magic (Checkmate vol. 2 #24).







Other media



Batman Beyond


A future version of Kobra (or, at least, his organization) appeared in four episodes of 

Batman Beyond
. Its members appeared not to be warriors but scientists who have an obsession with reptiles. They also made virus tests on people who were kidnapped. They in turn became reptilian creatures.


Little is known about the origins of Kobra, but they had long admired the power of the dinosaurs. They envisioned them as the only life form capable of ruling the world once again. So, for years Kobra sought a way to splice human genes with dinosaurs' DNA. Until they could achieve their main goal, Kobra used cutting edge technology for robberies, extortion and terrorism, which led them to clash with Batman (
Terry McGinnis) on a few occasions. 


Kobra was ruthless and unforgiving. Every member of Kobra was expected to have complete allegiance and devotion to the organization, and any protocol breach was punished with a gruesome death in a pit of vipers. 


Among their interrogation techniques, Kobra used a sensor that turned one's thoughts into pictures. This way they could weed out traitors among their ranks (Though, this instrument was proved to be fallible, as a young kid deceived it by sheer force of will as seen in  Unmasked ).


There were several Kobra branches around the world, and each cell seemed to have its own Main Operator. The hierarchy of Kobra was depicted by color and garments. The ones on the bottom were foot soldiers, identified by their green spandex uniforms. They responded to members who donned an orange variation of the same spandex uniform, with golden bracelets on their forearms and forelegs, and a green exomis or hooded cloak. There were also scientists, technicians, or assistants who wore these garments. However, Main Operators usually had a chin beard. 


Within the infantry there were assassins that ranked above the rest. They were trained in specific fighting techniques, or armed with special weaponry, such as electrical flail or edge weapons. Altogether, these combatants were more dangerous and deadlier than the average foot soldier. 


In  Plague , Kobra continued executing fiendish schemes to gain an edge and thrive. At one point, they developed a deadly super virus capable of complete biological devastation. They hired a criminal named Falseface to smuggle the virus from Saint Denis to Gotham City, and then broke into Gotham Plastics, where they planned to coat millions of cred-cards with the virus, thus transmitting it by hand-to-hand contact. In case that plan failed or the government resisted their demands, Kobra secretly turned Falseface into a virus carrier. Kobra planned to demand a ransom of 10 billion credits. Their actions were eventually intercepted by the NSA that had enlisted Stalker to track down and retrieve the virus. Kobra's plans were foiled by an unlikely alliance between Stalker and Batman. 


In the  Curse of the Kobra,  it's revealed that despite having a resolute goal, Kobra lacked cohesive leadership. Therefore, they decided to genetically engineer the perfect Kobra leader. In the long run, they created Zander. They carefully monitored and controlled his gestation, striving to create a healthy and resilient makeup. Right from early infancy, Kobra started to groom Zander to become the perfect leader. They brainwashed and trained him in military strategies and tactics. When Zander finally reached adolescence and was ready to assume his leadership, Kobra could finally move on with their plan. They stole a vial from Dr. Padu Banjahri, a paleontologist who had been recovering dinosaur DNA, and spliced their lackeys into dinosaurs. However, there was still the problem of adaptability. Dinosaurs were cold-blooded, so they could only survive in a tropical environment. In order to raise the planet's temperature, Kobra had stolen the R12 thermal bomb from the Nova Research Center. They planned to plunge it into a dormant volcano standing on a rift that went down to the Earth's core. This would start a chain reaction that would raise the temperature of the whole planet. However, thanks to the combined efforts of Batman and Kairi Tanaga, Zander's guru, Kobra's supreme goal was brought to naught, and in the process they lost their perfect leader.




Static Shock

 
The version of Kobra seen in Batman Beyond appears in an episode of 

Static Shock
. In 

Future Shock
, Kobra carried on with their tactics, and eventually acquired another leader. They also secretly moved in to Platform 247, and used it as their new headquarters. In an undocumented occurrence, the police arrested Kobra Leader. Thus, Kobra designed a plan to imprison Static and then negotiate a trade. They forged a holographic message from 
Gear so as to lure 
Static into Platform 247, where he was ambushed, subdued and imprisoned in a stasis field. The negotiation, however, was never in Kobra's plans, as they never truly intended to give up the captive hero. It was but a ruse to provide their leader with an escape opportunity, while he was being transported to the exchange. After breaking out, Kobra Leader headed off to Kobra's headquarters to kill Static. However, Batman and Static's younger self broke in and took on Kobra's Leader and his soldiers. Static released his older self from the stasis field, and saw him single-handedly defeat a battalion of Kobra worshipers with a single jolt. Kobra's fate afterward remains unknown.




Justice League Unlimited


In 

Justice League Unlimited
, Kobra is among the villains seen as a member of 


Gorilla Grodd

's 
Legion of Doom

n army from 1859 to 1872, when he retired with the rank of captain. He then gave himself up to philosophical work, especially in connection with the phenomena of 
hypnotism and 
occultism from the modern psychological standpoint. He attempted to deduce the existence of spirit, apart from, and yet entering from time to time into connection with, the phenomena of the senses, by an examination of the relation between the ego of thought and the age of sensible experience as understood by 


Immanuel Kant

. In 1868 he received the degree of doctor from the 
University of Tubingen in recognition of a treatise on the psychology of dreams (Oneirokritikon. Der Traum vom Slandpunkt des transcend ent alen Idealismus).

Subsequently, he published numerous works on various psychological and scientific subjects, of which the more important are:


Der gesunde Menschenverstand vor den Problemen der Wissenschaft (I872); Der Kampf urns Dasein am Himmel (1874), republished in 1882 under the title Entwickelungsgeschichte des Wellalls; Die Planetenbewohner und die Nebularhypolhese (1880); Die Philosophie der Mystik (1885); Justinus Kerner und die Seherin von Prevorst (1886); Die monistische Seelenlehre (1888); Die Mystik der allen Griechen (1888); Kants mystische Weltanschauung (1889); Studien airs dem Gebiete der Geheimwissenschaften (1890); Der Spirilismus (1893); Die Entdeckung der Seele durch die Gehef mussenschaften (1894-1895). 


In Der Kampf urns Dasein am Himmel, von Prel endeavoured to apply the 
Darwinian doctrine of biological 
evolution not only to the sphere of consciousness but also even more widely as the philosophical principle of the world. He was one of a large number of German thinkers who during the latter half of the 19th century endeavoured to treat the mind as a mechanism. He died on the 4th of August 1899.

Hippology (from Greek:      , himpos,  horse ; and      , logos,  knowledge ) is the study of the 
horse.

Today, Hippology is the title of an Equine Knowledge Contest that is usd in 4-H, FFA and many horse breed contests. Hippology consists of four phases: Horse Judging, Written Examination and Slide Identification, ID Stations and Team Problem Solving. 


Many youth across the United States, and in other countries compete in Hippology annually, showing their knowledge of all things  horse .


Items covered in the contest may cover any equine subject, i.e., Reproduction, Training, Parasites, Dressage, Draft Horses, History and Origins, Anatomy and Physiology, Driving and Harnessing, Horse Industry, Horse Management, Breeds, Genetics, Mustangs, Western Games, Colors, Famous Horses in History, Parts of the Saddle, Types of Bits, Feedstuffs and Nutrition. Hippologers with broad horse knowledge and skills will do well in Hippology.

Guitar amplifier manufacturers








Dumble musical instrument amplifiers are custom manufactured in very limited numbers by Alexander ( Howard ) Dumble of 
Los Angeles,

California
.  Dumble began making amplifiers in the late 1960s in 

Santa Cruz
.  There are reportedly fewer than 300 in total. Amplifier models have included the Overdrive Special (ODS), Overdrive Reverb, Steel String Singer (SSS), Dumbleland and Winterland.

Influence


Several companies have produced amplifiers somewhat based on the Dumble Overdrive Special. Some DIY-amplifier building hobbyists have also started to build Dumble-influenced amplifiers from un-official schematics and inside chassis photographs circulating on the Internet although many have been voluntarily taken down following requests from Mr. Dumble.  Amp makers who openly promote their  Dumble Clones  include the Tony Bruno Super 100 and Andy Fuchs' line of Overdrive Supreme amps.  Dumble's German importer in the '80s made a clone called the Kitty Hawk Standard.  Since the 1980s, Mr. Dumble has covered the preamp circuitry of his amps with a thick layer of usually opaque epoxy, protecting his schematic's exact design, although several amplifiers are known to have been  de-gooped  and their component values measured.




Circuitry


The circuitry varies somewhat between individual amplifiers, because each one was built and voiced for a specific player.  Amplifiers built around the same time tend to share some of the same circuitry and component values.  However, several amplifiers were  later sent back to Dumble to have their circuitry updated.


Part of the characteristic sound of Dumble amplifiers comes from Dumble's choice of parts:



the type of capacitors used  in the tonestack and in the overdrive stages 


the type of plate resistors


the output transformer


the lead dress, and the use of shielded wire.


Dumble amplifiers are built on eyelet boards .  The chassis is made of aluminum.


All Dumble amplifiers operate using 
vacuum tubes.  Overdrive Specials use 





12AX7




 tubes in the preamp, 





6L6




 tubes in the power amp in older models, and (





EL34




) tubes used in the power amplifier section in some newer models.
A separate Dumblelator; buffered effects loop (a cathode-follower output with a triode gain stage for recovery), is recommended for using effects processors with a Dumble amplifier.




Models



 Overdrive Special 





 50W ODS Combo


There are two inputs: a  normal  input and 
FET input where the signal from the guitar goes to a J-FET  line level booster  pre-amplifier before entering the first tube stage (originally intended for use with acoustic guitars and other instruments with low output levels).
The first tube  is followed by a passive tonestack with adjustments for treble, middle, and bass. Typical switching options available in the different models include:



 Bright (bypasses the volume potentiometer with a capacitor to boost the high frequencies)


 Deep (changes the voicing of the tonestack for a warmer tone)


 Mid (increases the value of the treble capacitor to boost the midrange frequencies)


 Boost (disconnects the treble potentiometer from the bass potentiometer for a preamplifier level boost)


 Rock/Jazz (switches between a 

Fender
-esque voicing and a more  hi-fi-type  of voicing).




The tonestack is followed by another clean preamplifier stage. The resulting signal is either fed straight into the power amplifier ( clean channel), or  into the (two-stage) overdrive section.    The power amplifier uses a standard long-tail pair phase inverter with negative feedback.  It will break up , but only at very high volume levels, or when the preamplifier  boost   switch is engaged.


In some newer models (1990s to present), the overdrive stages are followed by a passive tonestack (treble , middle and bass), which is adjustable using trimmer potentiometers inside the amplifier.  This is known as the  Hot Rubber Monkey  (HRM) modification (these amplifiers are voiced for the overdrive channel to be used with the preamplifier boost  engaged).  Most players use three tones: clean, clean with boost on, and overdrive with boost on.


The  Skyliner  EQ refers to a newer (mid-1980s to present) way of voicing the tonestack. It is said to provide a better clean tone than the earlier voicing of the tonestack. Some lower serial number amps have been retrofitted with this EQ.


The so called  Robben Ford Mod  (terminology used by DIY-hobbyists) refers to using a power resistor instead of a choke in the power supply in order to induce more  sag  in the amplifier.




 Overdrive Reverb 




Much of the circuitry in the Overdrive Reverb is similar to that of the Overdrive Special. The reverb circuit in one known specimen uses three tubes ( two tube configurations are commonly used).  The first tube  is used to amplify the input signal, which is then sent to the second tube that drives the reverb tank through a transformer in a configuration similar to that used in Fender amplifiers.  The third tube mixes the clean and the reverberated signals .  Both reverb  send  (the signal level sent to the reverb tank) and reverb  return  (how much of the signal returned from the reverb tank is mixed with the dry signal) are individually controllable.




Steel String Singer 



This model was made in very limited numbers. Power output was usually 100W, although Stevie Ray Vaughan's famous  King Tone Consoul  SSS was rated at 150W.  It was a  clean , loud amp with no overdrive section. The standard model used 4 x 7025 high-mu twin triodes; 1 x 5751 high-mu twin triode and 4 x 6L6 power tubes. The amp used a standard Dumble tonestack with an optional two toneswitch tone filter.




150W Overdrive Special





Back Panel of 150W Dumble ODS



In 1987, Dumble made two otherwise unique amplifiers for Todd Sharp at 150W utilizing signature components from several of his other famous models.  The power supply is similar to that of the 150W Dumbleland amplifier, but using 7025 tubes as in the Steel String singer.  It is switchable from 150W to 75W.  Preamp tubes are: a)6 x 7025, b)1 x 7247, c)1 x 5751 while the poweramp uses 4 x 6550A tubes. The ampifier also uses the SSS 3-spring reverb.  Dumble also included a tremolo.  The back panel includes controls for adjusting the bias and dynamic balance which are believed to be unique to this model; speaker outputs are switchable at 2,4 or 8 ohms.  Inputs include normal and FET as with most Dumble amplifiers.  The footswitch permits turning on and off the overdrive, the pre-amp boost, the tremolo and reverb. The intention according to Dumble was to combine the best features of the Overdrive Reverb and the Steel String Singer with the distinctive overdrive circuit of the Overdrive Special.  One of Sharp's amplifiers was stolen and has not been recovered.  The  other, pictured here, is in Los Angeles, reportedly in a recording studio.  The power circuit has been described in Aspen Pittman's  The Tube Amp Book. 




Winterland



The Winterland appears to have been designed primarily as a PA system.  It is rated at 450W and was named after the San Francisco concert hall.




Dumbleator





Dumbleator






Dumbleator II



Dumble also occasionally makes a tube-buffered external effects loop called a Dumbleator.  A few Dumble amps have a Dumbleator circuit built into them, but most do not. Many users insist that a Dumbletor is required to obtain the optimal sound when using effects boxes and pedals. The Dumbleator has separate  Send  and  Receive  circuit for the effects; a gain control,  Bright Switch  and a return level. Dumbleators are even rarer than Dumble amplifiers. The original Dumbleator was mono-in with mono-out, and follow-up Dumbleator II allowed for stereo output instead.

The Velvet Underground







Chronicles is a 
compilation album by 


The Velvet Underground

. It was initially released for the 

Australia
n market by 

Mercury Records
 in 1991 as part of their  Startrax  series of budget compilations. The album was also made available in 
Europe.



About the album


Chronicles is a straightforward, budget-priced compilation drawn from the studio albums the band recorded for 

Verve Records
 and 






MGM Records





 and their one 
live album for 

Mercury Records
 (all of which by the time of compilation resided under the 
Polygram umbrella). The budget series approach left no scope for licensing tracks off the band's fourth studio album, 

Loaded
, which was recorded for 

Atlantic Records
. The live versions of  Sweet Jane  and  Rock and Roll  were used instead.


In the early 
Nineties, demand was high for Velvet Underground compilations thanks to 


Lou Reed

's creative renascence. Because of the budget pricing of the compilation, Chronicles was more popular than the contemporary full-price 








American







/
European Verve compilation  (1989).

 Hungarian mythology
Legendary birds




A Liderc, or Liderc, is a unique supernatural being of Hungarian 
folklore. It has three known varieties, which often borrow traits from one another.

The first, more traditional form of the Liderc is as a miracle chicken, csodacsirke in Hungarian, which hatches from the first egg of a black hen kept warm under the arm of a human. Some versions of the legend say that an unusually tiny black hen's egg, or any egg at all, may become a Liderc, or that the egg must be hatched by placing it in a heap of manure. 1
The Liderc attaches itself to people to become their lover. If the owner is a woman, the being shifts into a man, but instead of pleasuring the woman, it fondles her, sits on her body, and sometimes sucks her blood, making her weak and sick after a time. From this source comes a Hungarian word for 
nightmare -- lidercnyomas, which literally means  Liderc pressure , from the pressure on the body while the being sits on it. Alternate names for the Liderc are iglic, ihlic in 
 itny ostrov, luderc, piritusz in the south, and mit-mitke in the east. 2
The Liderc hoards gold and thus makes its owner rich. To dispose of this form of the Liderc, it must be persuaded to perform an impossible task, such as haul sand with rope, or water with a 
sieve. It can also be destroyed by locking it into a tree hollow.


The second variety of the Liderc is as a tiny being, a temporal devil, foldi ordog in Hungarian. It has many overlapping qualities with the miracle chicken form, and it may also be obtained from a black hen's egg, but more often it is found accidentally in rags, boxes, glass bottles, or in the pockets of old clothes. A person owning this form of the Liderc suddenly becomes rich and is capable of extraordinary feats, because the person's soul has supposedly been given to the Liderc, or even to the 
Devil.3 


The third variety is as a Satanic lover, ordogszeret  in Hungarian, quite similar to an 
incubus or 
succubus. This form of the Liderc flies at night, appearing as a fiery light, a 
will o' the wisp, or even as a bird of fire. In the northern regions of 

Hungary
 and beyond, it is also known as ludverc, lucfir. In 






Transylvania





 and 

Moldavia
 it goes by the names of liderc, luderc, and sometimes ordog, literally, the Devil. While in flight, the Liderc sprinkles flames. On earth, it can assume a human shape, usually the shape of a much lamented dead relative or lover. Its footprints are that of a horse. The Liderc enters houses through chimneys or keyholes, brings sickness and doom to its victims. It leaves the house with a splash of flames and dirties the walls. Burning incense and 
birch branches prevent the Liderc from entering one's dwelling. In the eastern regions of Hungary and beyond, it is said the Liderc is impossible to outrun, it haunts cemeteries, and it must disappear at the first crow of a rooster at dawn. 4



 Appearances in Modern Literature 



A liderc is mentioned in the famous historical novel, 





The Name of the Rose




, by 


Umberto Eco

.
But he knew a prodigious spell that would make every woman succumb to love. You had to kill a black cat and dig out its eyes, then put them in two eggs of a black hen, one egg in one eye, one eye in the other (and he showed me two eggs that he swore he had taken from appropriate hens). Then you had to let the eggs rot in a pile of horse dung (and he had one ready in a corner of the vegetable garden where nobody ever went), and there a little devil would be born from each egg, and would then be at your service, procuring for you all the delights of this world.







 mentioned in 
Katie MacAlister's novel Fire Me Up.

Proj construction

2008-05-08T06:50:03Z

TheCoffee

Scheme theory




In 
algebraic geometry, Proj is a construction analogous to the 
spectrum-of-a-ring construction of 
affine schemes, which produces objects with the typical properties of 
projective spaces and 
projective varieties. It is a fundamental tool in 
scheme theory.

In this article, all 
rings will be assumed to be commutative and with identity.



Proj of a graded ring




Proj as a set


Let S be a 
graded ring where 




 S = \bigoplus_{i\ge 0} S_i.


We define the set Proj S to be the set of homogeneous 
prime ideals that do not contain 




 S_+ = \bigoplus_{i gt;0} S_i.


For brevity we will sometimes use X for Proj S.




Proj as a topological space


We may define a 
topology, called the 



Zariski topology


, on Proj S by defining the closed sets to be those of the form




V(a) = \{ p \in \operatorname{Proj}\, S \mid a \subseteq p \}, 


where a is a 
homogeneous ideal of S.  As in the case of affine schemes it is quickly verified that the V(a) form the closed sets of a 
topology on X.
Equivalently, we may take the open sets as a starting point and define




 D(a) = \{ p \in \operatorname{Proj}\, S \mid a \;\not\subseteq\; p \}.


A common shorthand is to denote D(Sf) by D(f), where Sf is the 
ideal generated by f.  For any a, D(a) and V(a) are obviously complementary and hence the same proof as before shows that the D(a) are a topology on Proj S.  The advantage of this approach is that the D(f), where f ranges over all homogeneous elements of S, form a 
base for this topology, which is an indispensable tool for the analysis of Proj S just as the analogous fact for the spectrum of a ring is likewise indispensable.




Proj as a scheme


We also construct a 
sheaf on Proj S, called the  ldquo;structure sheaf rdquo; as in the affine case, which makes it into a 
scheme.  As in the case of the Spec construction there are many ways to proceed: the most direct one, which is also highly suggestive of the construction of regular functions on a projective variety in classical algebraic geometry, is the following.  For any open set U of Proj S (which is by definition a set of homogeneous prime ideals of S not containing S_+) we define the ring O_X(U) to be the set of all functions




 f \colon U \to \bigcup_{p \in U} S_{(p)}


(where S_{(p)} denotes the subring of the ring of fractions S_p consisting of fractions of homogeneous elements of the same degree) such that for each prime ideal p of U:





 f(p) is an element of S_{(p)};


 There exists an open subset V of U containing p and homogeneous elements s, t of S of the same degree such that for each prime ideal q of V:


 t is not in q;


 f(q) = s/t.




It follows immediately from the definition that the O_X(U) form a sheaf of rings O_X on Proj S, and it may be shown that the pair (Proj S, O_X) is in fact a scheme (this is accomplished by showing that each of the open subsets D(f) is in fact an affine scheme).




The sheaf associated to a graded module


The essential property of S for the above construction was the ability to form localizations S_{(p)} for each prime ideal p of S.  This property is also possessed by any 
graded module M over S, and therefore with the appropriate minor modifications the preceding section constructs for any such M a sheaf, denoted \tilde{M}, of graded O_X-modules on Proj S.




The twisting sheaf of Serre




For related information, and the classical Serre twist sheaf, see 
tautological bundle

A special case of the sheaf associated to a graded module is when we take M to be S itself with a different grading: namely, we let the degree-d elements of M be the degree-(d + 1) elements of S, and denote M = S(1).  We then obtain \tilde{M} as a sheaf of graded O_X-modules on Proj S, denoted O_X(1) or simply O(1), called the 
twisting sheaf of Serre.  It can be checked that O(1) is in fact an 
invertible sheaf.


One reason for the utility of O(1) is that it recovers the algebraic information of S that was lost when, in the construction of O_X, we passed to fractions of degree zero.  In the case Spec A for a ring A, the global sections of the structure sheaf form A itself, whereas the global sections of O_X here form only the degree-zero elements of S.  If we define




 O(n) = \bigotimes_{i = 1}^n O(1)


then each O(n) contains the degree-n information about S, and taken together they contain all the grading information that was lost.  Likewise, for any sheaf of graded O_X-modules N we define




 N(n) = N \otimes O(n)


and expect this  ldquo;twisted rdquo; sheaf to contain grading information about N.  In particular, if N is the sheaf associated to a graded S-module M we likewise expect it to contain lost grading information about M.  This suggests, though erroneously, that S can in fact be reconstructed from these sheaves; however, this is true in the case that S is a polynomial ring, below.




Projective n-space


If A is a ring, we define projective n-space over A to be the 
scheme 




\mathbb{P}^n_A = \operatorname{Proj}\, A[x_0,\ldots, x_n].


The grading on the polynomial ring  S=A[x_0,\ldots, x_n]  is defined by letting each  x_i  have degree one and every element of A, degree zero.  Comparing this to the definition of O(1), above, we see that the sections of O(1) are in fact linear homogeneous polynomials, generated by the x_i themselves.  This suggests another interpretation of O(1), namely as the sheaf of  ldquo;coordinates rdquo; for Proj S, since the x_i are literally the coordinates for projective n-space.





Global Proj



A generalization of the Proj construction replaces the ring S with a 
sheaf of algebras and produces, as the end result, a scheme which might be thought of as a fibration of Proj's of rings.  This construction is often used, for example, to construct projective space 
bundles over a 
base scheme.



Assumptions


Formally, let X be any 
scheme and S be a sheaf of graded O_X-algebras (the definition of which is similar to the definition of O_X-modules on a 
locally ringed space): that is, a sheaf with a direct sum decomposition




 S = \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} S_i


where each S_i is an O_X-module such that for every open subset U of X, S(U) is an O_X(U)-algebra and the resulting direct sum decomposition




 S(U) = \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} S_i(U)


is a grading of this algebra as a ring.  Here we assume that S_0 = O_X.  We make the additional assumption that S is a 
quasi-coherent sheaf; this is a  ldquo;consistency rdquo; assumption on the sections over different open sets that is necessary for the construction to proceed.




Construction


In this setup we may construct a scheme Proj S and a  ldquo;projection rdquo; map p onto X such that for every 
open affine U of X,




 (\operatorname\mathbf{Proj}\, S)|_{p^{-1}(U)} = \operatorname{Proj} (S(U)).


This definition suggests that we construct Proj S by first defining schemes Y_U for each open affine U, by setting




 Y_U = \operatorname{Proj}\, S(U),


and maps p_U \colon Y_U \to U, and then showing that these data can be glued together  ldquo;over rdquo; each intersection of two open affines U and V to form a scheme Y which we define to be Proj S.  It is not hard to show that defining each p_U to be the map corresponding to the inclusion of O_X(U) into S(U) as the elements of degree zero yields the necessary consistency of the p_U, while the consistency of the Y_U themselves follows from the quasi-coherence assumption on S.




The twisting sheaf


If S has the additional property that S_1 is a 
coherent sheaf and locally generates S over S_0 (that is, when we pass to the 
stalk of the sheaf S at a point x of X, which is a graded algebra whose degree-zero elements form the ring O_{X,x} then the degree-one elements form a finitely-generated module over O_{X,x} and also generate the stalk as an algebra over it) then we may make a further construction.  Over each open affine U, Proj S(U) bears an 
invertible sheaf 
O(1), and the assumption we have just made ensures that these sheaves may be glued just like the Y_U above; the resulting sheaf on Proj S is also denoted O(1) and serves much the same purpose for Proj S as the twisting sheaf on the Proj of a ring does.




Projective space bundles


As mentioned above, we obtain projective space bundles as a special case of this construction.  To do this, we take S to be locally free as an O_X-algebra, which means that there exists an 
open cover of X by open affines Spec A such that restricted to each of these, S is the sheaf associated to a polynomial ring over A.  This is stronger than being simply quasi-coherent and implies, in particular, that the number of variables in each such ring is constant on connected components of X.  By the construction above, we now have on a cover of X consisting of schemes U = Spec A




 \operatorname\mathbf{Proj}\, S = \operatorname{Proj}\, A[x_0, \dots, x_n] = \mathbb{P}^n_A = U \times \mathbb{P}^n,


and hence Proj S is a projective space bundle.

Institution of National Importance

Dairy


http://www.nddb.org

Chairman, 
Dr. Amrita Patel. (GCMMF)





The National Dairy Development Board is an institution of national importance setup by an Act of 
Parliament of 

India
.  The main office is located in 
Anand, 

Gujarat
 with regional offices throughout the country.  NDDB's subsidiaries include 

Mother Dairy
, 














Delhi













.


It was founded by Dr. 
Verghese Kurien and Dr. Amrita Patel is the current Chairman of the National Dairy Development Board, Anand.


The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was created in 
1965, fulfilling the desire of the then Prime Minister of India - the late 

Lal Bahadur Shastri
 - to extend the success of the Kaira Cooperative Milk Producers' Union (

Amul
) to other parts of India.   


That success combined the wisdom and energy of farmers with professional management to successfully capture liquid milk and milk product markets while supporting farmer investment with inputs and services. The major success of this mission was achieved through the 


World Bank

 financed 
Operation Flood, which lasted for 26 years from 1970 to 1996 and was responsible for making India the world's largest producer's of milk. This operation was started with the objective of increasing milk production, augmenting farmer income and providing fair prices for consumers. 


NDDB has now integrated 96,000 dairy co-operatives in what it calls the Anand Pattern, linking the village society to the state federations in a three-tier structure.


NDDB launched its Perspective Plan 2010 with four thrust areas: Quality Assurance, Productivity Enhancement, Institution Building and National Information Network.

A Caribbean Mystery

November 16 



1964






English






A Caribbean Mystery is a work of 
detective fiction by 



Agatha Christie


 and first published in the UK by the 
Collins Crime Club on November 16, 



1964


1 and in the US by 
Dodd, Mead and Company the following year23. The UK edition retailed at sixteen 
shillings (16/-)1 and the US edition at 
$4.503. It features the 
detective 

Miss Marple
.



Plot summary



 Would you like to see a picture of a murderer? , Jane Marple is asked by a stranger whilst on a luxurious holiday in the Caribbean. But before she has a chance to answer, the man abruptly changes the subject, and is found dead the next morning. Why has the photo vanished? Why is the hotelier prone to nightmares? Which guests are hiding secrets from their pasts or are not being forthright about their identities? And will Miss Marple be able to prevent the next murder?




Literary significance and reception



After lukewarm reviews of her two previous novels, Francis Iles (





Anthony Berkeley Cox




) felt that the writer was back on form in his review in 

The Guardian
's issue of December 11, 1964:  Mrs Agatha Christie has done it again. In A Caribbean Mystery she tells the reader explicitly what is going to happen; and yet when it does, nine out of ten will be taken completely by surprise   as I was. How does she do it? For the rest, it is Miss Marple this time who is in charge of the story; and all one can guess is that the setting is a Caribbean island. 4


Maurice Richardson in 

The Observer
 of November 15, 1964 began,  A most encouraging return to somewhere very near her best unputdownable form.  He summed up thus:  Suspicion nicely distributed among guests, many of them raffish adulterers. Not very hard to guess, but quite suspenseful. Good varied characterisation including a particularly excellent octogenarian tycoon. 5 Towards the end of the year, Richardson again commented on the book in a special Books of the Year: A Personal Choice column when he said,  Agatha Christie makes one of those gratifying veteran's comebacks.  6


The 

Daily Mirror
 of November 21, 1964 said,  Not quite at the top of her form. A Miss Marples (
sic) story which addicts won't find as unsolvable as usual.7








Robert Barnard




:  In the tradition of all those package-tour mysteries written by indigent crime writers who have to capitalize on their meagre holidays. Nothing much of interest, but useful for illustrating the 'fluffification' of Miss Marple. Reuses a ploy from 





Appointment with Death




. 8


'There is no more cunning player of the murder game than Agatha Christie' SUNDAY TIMES 9


'Throws off the false clues and misleading events as only a master of the art can do' NEW YORK TIMES 9




References in other works



The millionaire Jason Rafiel appears again, posthumously, in 
Nemesis where he sends Miss Marple on a case specifically because of her success in solving the events related in A Caribbean Mystery.




Film, TV or theatrical adaptations


A 1983 US TV movie adaptation starred 


Helen Hayes

 as Miss Marple. A BBC TV adaptation starring 

Joan Hickson
 was shown in 1989 version as part of the series Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. 
Donald Pleasance co-starred as Mr Rafiel.

WPBS,  Spice Radio Atlanta , is an 
AM radio, 


Desi

 music and news broadcaster licensed to the city of 

Conyers, Georgia
 in the 

Atlanta, Georgia
 radio market.  Their marketing describes their programming as follows:



Morning and evening weekdays drive time talk shows with news, weather, and traffic reports. Afternoons and weekends with popular Hindi music, Top 40 hits, Hindi classics, hits from Pakistan, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telegu, Kannada film soundtracks, news, general, entertainment and educational features.



WPBS is considered a Class D AM broadcast facility by the 

Federal Communications Commission
 operating with 12,000 
Watts of power during the daytime, and 5,000 
Watts during critical hours (around sunrise and sunset) using a non-directional 
antenna.  The station must sign-off after local sunset, to protect 

WHO
 in 

Des Moines, Iowa
.


The radio station has been the original holder of the WPBS 
call sign since 
1993.  It is not related to the 

Watertown, New York
-based 
PBS member station 






WPBS-TV





 (which has paid to license the  WPBS  name), and is not related in any way to 
NPR or the 
PBS television network.  


Prior to 
1993, the station was assigned the 
call sign of WPBE in 
1989, and WTPO in 
1986.  In September 
2003, the station changed operating frequency from its original 1050 
kHz to its current 1040 
kHz.  In May 
2005, the station changed its programming format from 
Gospel ( Praise 1040 ) to  Planeta X  

Spanish
 
talk radio format (which moved from 
WPBC (AM) at the time in the same 

Atlanta
 radio market). In 2008, it changed formats to  Spice Radio Atlanta.

Samban-Lei Sekpil is the world's tallest 
topiary.  Created by Moirangthem Okendra Kumbi, it is modelled in the shape of a series of open umbrellas and spheres. 

Moirangthem started mending the Samban-Lei in 
1983, originally planted by his sister in a small mustard oil can.  Samban-Lei is a flowering shrub use for fencing gardens in 





Manipur




 - Samban means fencing and Lei means flower in 

Manipuri
 language. Sekpil indicates the shape of the topiary and is derived from an ancient Manipuri word for a decorative 
bamboo post with rounded structured cloths forming canopy in many stages. The sekpil, at present also called as  Shattra  is generally used in worship and festivals in Manipur.

The California Nurses Association (CNA) is a 
labor union and professional association of 
Registered Nurses in the United States. CNA has a four-member Council of Presidents, currently including Deborah Burger, RN; Zenei Cortez, RN; Geri Jenkins, RN; and Malinda Markowitz, RN. The 
executive director of the CNA is long-time labor leader 
Rose Ann DeMoro. Its affiliated 

National Nurses Organizing Committee
 is a national professional association and labor union for Registered Nurses.


The CNA is a primary national organizational advocate of 
House Resolution 676.



Policies and activities




Founded in 1903 as the California State Nurses Association, the California Nurses Association is well known for its long history of advocacy for direct care registered nurses and patient care protections. On the national level, CNA is at the forefront of 
HR 676 advocacy.


Under DeMoro's leadership, CNA has also gained attention for its sponsorship of landmark legislative and regulatory reforms, including the nation's first mandated registered nurse-to-patient ratios which were sponsored by CNA. The ratio law, which requires hospitals to maintain a minimum number of nurses in all hospital units at all times to assure patient safety, was signed in 1999 by then-California Gov. Gray Davis. The ratios were implemented in 2004. 


A California Field Poll in April, 2008 found that CNA has the highest favorable rating among all groups, politicians, and institutions involved in public policy debates over healthcare reform in the state.1


CNA/NNOC has also drawn national attention for campaigns on behalf of patients denied medical treatment recommended by their physician.  The group's website urges support for HR 676 (Conyers), a bill for a national health care insurance plan, essentially, equal treatment Medicare for all Americans.


In 2004, CNA founded the National Nurses Organizing Committee in response to the requests of direct care RNs across the nation for a stronger voice to improve RN and patient care standards.  The CNA website [May 10, 2008] claims the group is the fastest-growing union in the United States, adding that 80,000 RNs now belong to CNA/NNOC.



















Wikinews











 has related news:





In April 2008, the CNA/NNOC clashed with 
SEIU over an agreement between SEIU and Catholic Healthcare Partners of Ohio. CNA/NNOC labeled the election a  sham.  SEIU and Catholic Healthcare Partners cancelled the election for 8,000 workers in 9 Ohio hospitals on whether to have SEIU representation.  NNOC contends that the agreement fits SEIU's pattern of forging controversial agreements with employers that sacrifice public protections and workplace standards in exchange for more members.2


On May 9, 2008, the Public Broadcasting System television show with Bill Moyers featured a segment on CNA/NNOC describing a campaign conducted by the organization saying all Americans should be entitled to the same level of care available to Vice President Dick Cheney and other members of Congress. The program may be viewed at www.pbs.org or www.calnurses.org.


On June 19, 2008, CNA/NNOC joined with other health care, labor, and community activists, and patients in sponsoring a day of protest against the insurance industry in 19 cities across the U.S. calling for enactment of HR 676.

Sumer








Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement originated in the loosely organized city-states of 
Early Dynastic 
Sumer.  The units themselves grew out of the tradition of 
counting tokens used by the 
Neolithic (c 6000 BCE) cultural complex of the 






Near East





.1  Consequently each 
city, 
kingdom and trade 
guild had its own standards until the 


Letter of Nanse

 reduced a plethora of multiple standards to a few agreed upon common groupings.  Successors to Sumerian Civilization including the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians continuted to use these groupings.  Akkado-Sumerian 
metrology has been reconstructed by applying statistical methods to compare 
Sumerian architecture, architectural plans, and issued official standards.



 Archaic system 


The systems that would later become the classical standard for Mesopotamia were developed in parallel with writing in 




 Uruk Period Sumer



 (c 4000 BCE).  Studies of 
protocuneiform indicate twelve separate counting systems used in Uruk.  



 Sexigesimal System S used to count slaves, animals, fish, wooden objects, stone objects, containers.


 Sexigesimal System S' used to count dead animals, certain types of beer 


 Bi-Sexigesimal System B used to count cereal, bread, fish, milk products


 Bi-Sexigesimal System B* used to count rations


 GAN2 System G used to count field measurement


  E system   used to count barley by volume


  E system  ' used to count malt by volume


  E system    used to count wheat by volume


  E System  * used to barley groats


 EN System E used to count weight


 U4 System U used to count calendrics


 DUGb System Db used to count milk by volume


 DUGc System Db used to count beer by volume




In 
Early Dynastic Sumer (c 3500-2300 BCE) 
metrology and mathematics were indistinguishable and treated as a single scribal discipline.  The idea of an abstract number did not yet exist, thus all quantities were written as metrological symbols and never as 
numerals followed by a unit symbol.  For example there was a symbol for one-sheep and another for one-day but no symbol for one.  About 600 of these metrological symbols exist, for this reason archaic Sumerian metrology is complex and not fully understood.2  In general however, length, volume, and mass are derived from a theoretical standard cube, called 'gur', filled with either barley, wheat, water, or oil.3  The mass of a gur-cube, called 'gun2' is defined as the weight a laden 
ass can carry.  However, because of the different 
specific gravities of these substances combined with dual numerical bases (
sexagesimal or 
decimal), multiple sizes of the gur-cube were used without consensus.  The different gur-cubes are related by proportion, based on the water gur-cube, according to four basic coefficents and their cubic roots.4  These coefficents are given as:





Komma =  80/81 correction when planning rations with a 360 day year


Leimma =  24/25 conversion from decimal to a sexagesimal number system


Diesis =  15/16 


Euboic =  5/6 




One official government standard of measurement of the archaic system was the Cubit of Nippur (2650 BCE).  It is a Euboic Mana + 1 Diesis (432g).5  This standard is the main reference used by archeologists to reconstruct the system.




 Classical system 


A major improvement came in 2150 BCE during the 










Akkadian Empire









 under the reign of 
Naram-Sin when the competing systems were unified by a single official standard, the royal gur-cube.6  His reform is considered the first standardized system of measure in Mesopotamia.7  The royal gur-cube (LU2.GAL.GUR,  #x1221A; #x12125;,  arru kurru) was a theoretical cube of water approximately 6m   6m   0.5m from which all other units could be derived.  The 
Neo-Sumerians continued use of the royal gur-cube as indicated by the 


Letter of Nanse

 issued in 2000 BCE by 




Gudea



 .  Use of the same standard continued through the 
Babylonian, 
Assyrian, and 
Persian Empires8.

Babylonian calendar




In the Archaic System time notation written in the U4 System U.  Multiple lunisolar calendars existed; however the civil calendar from the holy city of 










Nippur









( 
Ur III period ) was adopted by Babylon as their civil calendar.9  The calendar of Nippur dates to 3500 BCE and was itself based on older astronomical knowledge of an uncertain origin.  The main astronomical cycles used to construct the calendar were the 
synodic month, 
equinox year, and 
sideral day.

Late Roman military units




Auxilia palatina were the late 

Roman Empire
 infantry units, first raised by 


Constantine I

 as part of the new field army he created in about 325.

Some of the senior and probably oldest of these units had special names such as 
Cornuti or 
Brachiati; others were named after the tribes from which they were recruited (many of these in eastern Gaul, or among the German barbarians).  These units all became palatine units when a distinction was drawn between palatina and the remainder of the comitatenses around 365.   There is no direct evidence for the strength of an auxilium, but 
A.H.M. Jones (History of the Later Roman Empire, Blackwell, Oxford, 1964 p 682) estimates that it may have been 600 or 700.  Some auxilia are attested as 
limitanei, especially on the Danube.  It is not clear whether these were regarded as a different category of unit.

Villages in Lincolnshire
Local government in Lincolnshire




Swineshead is a village in 

Lincolnshire
, 

England
, around 7 miles west of 

Boston
.


Administration



It is one of eighteen 

parishes
 which, together with 

Boston
, form the 

Borough of Boston
 in the 
county of 

Lincolnshire
, 

England
. The local government has been arranged in this way since the reorganization of 
April 1 
1974, which resulted from the 

Local Government Act 1972
. This parish forms part of the Swineshead and Holland Fen electoral ward.


Hitherto, the parish had formed part of Boston Rural District, in the 
Parts of Holland. Holland was one of the three divisions (formally known as parts) of the traditional county of Lincolnshire. Since the 
Local Government Act of 
1888, Holland had been in most respects, a county in itself.




Cistercian Monastery



Swineshead 
abbey was founded in 1135 from 
Savigniacs. In 1147 it was converted to a 
cistercian monastery. In 1536 it was dissolved and the building of a private house and a park in 1607 destroyed the last marks of the monastery.




Herbert Ingram



It is the birthplace of 








Herbert Ingram







, founder of the 
Illustrated London News and MP for Boston, who was instrumental in bringing the railways and fresh piped water to the town.

 and Sulakshana. The film's score and soundtrack are composed by

Synopsis


An arrogant and short-tempered 
Carnatic Music genius, JKB(Sivakumar) falls in love with his intellectual equal Sindhu (Suhasini). The problem is he is already married to Bhairavi (Sulakshana), a loyal and loving wife, but one who is not able to satisfy or challenge him intellectually and is grieved due to her inability to beget an offspring. However, in a small town in South India, in the 80s, this intellectual attraction is misunderstood based on the cultural limitations of that age. Sindhu is seen as the homewrecker and is forced to quit her association with JKB. He pines for her and leans on alcohol for support, which sadly leads to his downward spiral ending in an embrassing barter of his musical knowledge for a drink. Sindhu reenters his life and brings him around, however she has a secret of her own. In the utmost union of their tastes and ideas the two of them share a physical intimacy too, leading to Sindhu giving birth to JKBs child. However, in a classic act of defiance to societie's rules, Sindhu gives up her child to be brought up by Bhairavi and leaves town to pursue and share her knowledge of music with the less fortunate.


This movie is considered to be a magnum opus of actor-hero Sivakumar.

The volcano at the beginning of the ride



El Rio de Tiempo (The River of Time) was a 
dark ride housed within the pyramid-shaped Mexico pavilion, at the Epcot theme park at the 









Walt Disney World Resort








 in 

Lake Buena Vista, Florida
. The ride carried passengers on a slow boat ride through various scenes from Mexico's history. The scenes were filled with 
audio-animatronic figures set to music, and dressed in authentic time-period clothing.


Synopsis


The ride began on a quiet river under an evening sky. It passed a 
volcano and continued on to scenes of native inhabitants. The ride continued with scenes of swimming, jumping into the ocean and relaxing at a bar. It would pass a Mexican shop, where merchants talked directly to the riders and tried to bargain with them. The finale was a fireworks filled night sky in modern day 


Mexico City

, with oversized marionettes dancing in a carousel.


The ride held the distinction of being the only ride at the Walt Disney World Resort that allowed the consumption of alcohol while riding.




Closure


In April 2007, El Rio del Tiempo was updated into a new ride titled Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros. This all-new version of the ride is themed on the characters from the 1944 Disney film 

The Three Caballeros
, including 


Donald Duck

, 
Jose Carioca and 


Panchito Pistoles

. The attraction's new story has Jose and Panchito searching for Donald across Mexico. It features much of the same settings as El Rio del Tiempo, and is located in the same place. 1

Anti-plurality voting

Voting systems
Positional electoral systems





Anti-plurality voting describes a voting method in which each voter votes against a single candidate, and the candidate with the fewest votes against wins. Anti-plurality voting is an example of a 
positional voting method.



 An Example 





Tennessee's four cities are spread throughout the state





Imagine that 





Tennessee




 is having an election on the location of its 
capital. The population of Tennessee is concentrated around its four major cities, which are spread throughout the state. For this example, suppose that the entire 
electorate lives in these four cities, and that everyone wants to live as near the capital as possible.


The candidates for the capital are:



 

Memphis
, the state's largest city, with 42% of the voters, but located far from the other cities


 

Nashville
, with 26% of the voters


 

Knoxville
, with 17% of the voters


 

Chattanooga
, with 15% of the voters




The preferences of the voters would be divided like this:




42% of voters(close to Memphis)

26% of voters(close to Nashville)

15% of voters(close to Chattanooga)

17% of voters(close to Knoxville)





 Memphis


 Nashville


 Chattanooga


 Knoxville






 Nashville


 Chattanooga


 Knoxville


 Memphis






 Chattanooga


 Knoxville


 Nashville


 Memphis






 Knoxville


 Chattanooga


 Nashville


 Memphis







In this voting system, each voter would mark a vote against his or her fourth preference. In this case, it would be a tie between Nashville and Chattanooga, both received zero votes.




 Characteristics 



As can be seen from the example, in the absence of 
tactical voting, this system tends to favor middle-of-the-road candidates. However, it is very sensitive to tactical voting, as any candidate perceived beforehand as a potential winner will attract more countervotes from partisans of their opponents. This creates the paradoxical situation for the candidates that, in order to win, you need to appear not to be winning. For this reason, few would advocate this system for general high-stakes use, though for its simplicity it can be useful in specific situations (where voters are not motivated to use tactical voting).




 Voting method criteria evaluation 



APV satisfies the 
monotonicity criterion, the 
participation criterion, the 
favorite betrayal criterion and the 
consistency criterion. It does not satisfy the 


Condorcet loser criterion

, the 
independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion, the 
independence of clones criterion or 
reversal symmetry.

CBC North is the name for the 

Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
's radio and television service in the 
Canadian Arctic. Originally known as the CBC Northern Service, its first operations began in 1958 with radio broadcasts including the establishment of 

CFYK
 in 
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.



 Radio 


CBC North Radio carries daily aboriginal language programming in 
Dene Suline, 
Tlicho, 
North Slavey, 
South Slavey, 
Gwich'in, 


Inuvialuktun

, and 


Inuktitut

. The shows include news, weather and entertainment, providing a vital service to the many people in Northern Canada for whom English is not their first language. 


In the 

Yukon
, a conventional 

CBC Radio One
 schedule in English is aired on 

CFWH
. CFWH is, however, the only station in the network which uses the Saturday afternoon 


local arts program

 block to air a 

French language
 program, as the territory is not served by a 
Premiere Chaine production centre or a local francophone 
community radio station.


In the 

Northwest Territories
, afternoon programming is pre-empted; instead, CBC North airs special afternoon programming in 
First Nations languages. On 

CFYK
 in 
Yellowknife and the southern part of the territory, the afternoon schedule is as follows:



 1:00 - 2:00 p.m. - Tide Godi, 




Dogrib






 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. - Le Got'she deh, 




Slavey






 3:00 - 4:00 p.m. - Dene Dayalt'i, 

Dene Suline



On 

CHAK
 in 

Inuvik
 and the northern Beaufort Delta area, afternoon programs include Nantaii in 
Gwich'in from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.  and Tusaavik in 


Inuvialuktun

 from 3:00 until 4 p.m. The Northwest Territories otherwise hears the conventional CBC Radio One schedule.


In 

Nunavut
, far greater differences occur on 

CFFB
. The Nunavut service is the only local/regional CBC Radio service which covers three time zones (Eastern, Central and Mountain). The local morning program, Qulliq, broadcast in Inuktitut and English segments, airs from 6 a.m. until 10 a.m., and is followed by abbreviated broadcasts of 


The Current

 and 


Sounds Like Canada

. At noon, a bilingual program Nipivut airs in 


Inuktitut

 and English.  In the afternoons, programming is in 


Inuktitut

 and includes Tausunni from 

Iqaluit
, Tuttavik from 
Kuujjuaq and Tusaajaksat from 
Rankin Inlet. These programs air in place of Q. Subsequently, in the evenings, Ullumi Tusaqsauqaujut presents highlights from the day's Inuktitut programs at 10 p.m. Eastern. At 10:30 p.m. Eastern  Sinnaksautit features traditional Inuit storytelling, preempting the nighttime edition of Q. Regular CBC Radio One programming is heard again after 11 p.m. 


As Nunavut already has an extensive schedule of unique local programming, however, CFFB is the only station in the network not to air its own local cultural magazine at 5 p.m. on Saturday afternoons   instead, the station airs the Ontario regional magazine 


Bandwidth

 in that timeslot.


In the 


Nunavik

 region of northern 

Quebec
, the program service from 

Nunavut
 is heard on a network of community-owned FM transmitters, with some program differences.  Weekday mornings from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. Quebec AM from Quebec City is heard. Some community access programs from the 

Inuit
 broadcasting organization 
Taqramiut Nipingat Inc. are heard in some timeslots.



 Shortwave services 


In northern 

Quebec
, more differences occur.  CBC Radio Nord Quebec operates a shortwave service, transmitted from the 

RCI
 transmitter in 

Sackville, New Brunswick
 on 9625 kHz, and programmed from the 

CBC
 studios in Montreal.


Radio Nord Quebec also airs a hybrid Radio One/
Premiere Chaine schedule mixed with programming in 

Cree
 and 


Inuktitut

 to the 
James Bay region.


Two CBC Radio One stations, 

CFGB
 in 
Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador (with 
call sign CKZN) and 

CBU
 in 
Vancouver, British Columbia (with call sign CKZU) operate shortwave relay transmitters, but neither transmission site has the capability to reach the Arctic with usable signals year round.



 Reception issues 


Both Radio One transmitters (and CBC Northern Quebec) broadcast 1 kW 
ERP signals on a fixed frequency.


CBC Radio One and CBC Northern Quebec shortwave relays can be quite difficult to receive due to increased terrestrial noise from modern electrical and electronic systems.






Television






CBC North ident, September 1998





The primary CBC North television production centre is in 
Yellowknife  (







CFYK






), with smaller production centres in 

Whitehorse
  (





CFWH




) and 
Iqaluit (







CFFB






). The CBC North television service is seen through a network of both 

CBC
-owned and community-owned rebroadcasters in virtually all communities in the 

Northwest Territories
, the 

Yukon
, and 

Nunavut
.


CBC North airs largely the same programming as 

CBC Television
, with some exceptions. The station airs an hour long evening news program known as , anchored by 
Nadira Begg. 


A daily newscast in 
Inuktitut, 
Igalaaq, is also aired at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time and again at 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time in Nunavut; 4:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. in the Northwest Territories, with anchor 
Rassi Nashalik. A weekly 

Cree
 newsmagazine, 
Maamuitaau, also airs on CBC North TV.


Unlike the other owned-and-operated CBC stations, CBC North airs few local ads   instead airing promotions for other CBC programs and public service announcements.


There are two CBC North television feeds   one for the NWT and Nunavut providing a Mountain Time schedule and another for the Yukon on Pacific Time. All local CBC North programs originate from Yellowknife and other Arctic locales. Viewers with C-Band dishes used to enjoy CBC North in the clear until around 2000, when the CBC switched to a proprietary digital system, requiring a $3000 receiver.


Prior to the switch to digital transmission, the two CBC North TV satellite feeds originated in St. John's, Newfoundland (which was seen in the Eastern Arctic) and Vancouver, British Columbia, (which was seen in the N.W.T. and Yukon). Those channels carried some regional programs originating from those areas to the North. With the new digital transmission system (now centralised at CBC Television's headquarters in 
Toronto), the North no longer sees the regional east coast and west coast programs.


Some US communities offer CBC North on cable or low-powered TV; in 

Alexandria, Minnesota
, for example, a local TV association offers CBC North on one of their 
LPTV channels.

Interior of Blackpool North station.





Blackpool North railway station is the terminus of the main 




Blackpool branch line



 from 

Preston
, in 

Lancashire
, 

England
. Services from York (via Burnley), Buxton, 

Liverpool
 and 

Manchester
 terminate here. 


The station was opened in its present form in 1974, and succeeded a previous station a few hundred yards away on Talbot Road which had first opened in 1846 and had been rebuilt in 1898. The present station is based on the 1938 concrete canopy which covered the entrance to the former excursion platforms of the old station.


Blackpool North was on the 

InterCity
 network until 2003 when 

Virgin Trains
 withdrew 
HST and 

Voyager
 services to 

London Euston
 and 

Birmingham
.1 Former local franchise holder 

First North Western
 ran services from Blackpool to London Euston, but these were soon discontinued. 


The resort's other terminus station, 

Blackpool South
, is situated at the end of the South Fylde branch line, and does not connect to Blackpool North. 


As 






Blackpool





 is a popular 
tourist 
resort, with its famous 
Pleasure Beach and beaches, there are many measures put in to prevent fare evasion, including automated barrier checks2 as well as the conductors on the train. The station is some distance from the 

Blackpool tramway
.




History



The first station opened on 
29 April 
1846 as Talbot Road, and was first rebuilt in 1898. The rebuilt station consisted of two parallel train sheds and a terminal building, in Dickson Road between Talbot Road and Queen Street. Platforms 1 to 6 were located in the sheds, with a larger island between platforms 1 and 2 to accommodate taxis. In addition, there was effectively, in all but name, a separate station at the east end of Queen Street, with open  excursion  platforms 7 to 16, used only in summer.3 In 1974 the main station was demolished, replaced by the current station based on the former excursion platforms.

The Western Railway of Alabama (WRA) was created by the owners of the 
Montgomery and West Point Railroad in 1854.   It was built to further the M WP's development West from 

Montgomery, Alabama
 to 

Selma, Alabama
.  When the line was finally constructed in 1870, the M WP was merged into the WRA, creating a line from Selma to 

West Point, Georgia
.  It served 

Auburn, Alabama
 and connected in 

Opelika, Alabama
 to the 
Central of Georgia line from 

Columbus, Georgia
 to 

Birmingham, Alabama
.  Although it was partially owned by the 
Central of Georgia around the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century, it did not end up being owned by 
Norfolk Southern when that company acquired the CofG's parent, the 
Southern Railway.

In the 1980s, the line and its sister railroads, the 
Atlanta and West Point Railroad and the 
Georgia Railroad, became part of the 




Family Lines System



, along with the 






Seaboard Coast Line Railroad





, the 
Louisville and Nashville Railroad and the 




Clinchfield Railroad



. The lines were all later renamed 




Seaboard System Railroad



, which in 
1986 merged with the 


Chessie System

 to become 






CSX Transportation





.


The WRA is still in full use for freight. Passenger service on this line ceased in the late 1960s.

Back to Then is the title of a solo album released by singer/songwriter 

Darius Rucker
, lead singer of 
Hootie   The Blowfish. The album was a departure for him as this project was a contemporary 
R B album, as compared to his group's pop/rock efforts.


In 2001, he recorded his solo debut album The Return of Mongo Slade for 

Atlantic Records
. However due to contractual changes, it was never released. Rucker then signed with Hidden Beach Recordings and released Back to Then in July 2002.

Common names: dwarf boas.2

The Tropidophiinae are a 
family of 
snakes found from 








Mexico







 and the 
West Indies south to southeastern 

Brazil
. These are small to medium-sized 
fossorial snakes, some with beautiful and striking color patterns. Currently, 4 
genera containing 22 
species are recognized.2



Description


This family is confined to the 
neotropics, mainly in 

Hispaniola
, 











Jamaica










, and the 

Cayman Islands
 with the greatest diversity being in 

Cuba
, where new species are being discovered frequently. These snakes are very small, averaging to about 30-60 cm in total lengh. Most species spend their day burrowed underground or under vegetation, surfacing only at night or when it rains. Some species are 
arboreal and are ofter seen hiding in 
bromeliads in trees. They have the ability to change color from light (when they are active at night) to dark (inactive in the day). This color change is brought about by the movement of dark pigment granules. When threatened, they coil up into a tight ball. A more peculiar defensive behavior is their ability to voluntarily bleed from the eyes, mouth and nostrils.

Heavy crude oil

Petroleum




Heavy crude oil or Extra Heavy oil is any type of 
crude oil which does not flow easily. It is referred to as  heavy  because its 
density or 
specific gravity is higher than of 
light crude oil. Heavy crude oil has been defined as any liquid petroleum with an 


API gravity

 less than 20 ,1
meaning that its specific gravity is greater than 0.933. 

Production, transportation, and refining of heavy crude oil present special challenges compared to light crude oil.  The largest reserves of heavy oil in the world are located north of the 
Orinoco river in 

Venezuela
2, the same amount as the 
conventional oil reserves of 

Saudi Arabia
3, but 30 or more countries are known to have reserves.  Heavy crude oil is closely related to 
tar sands, the main difference being that tar sands generally do not flow at all.  

Canada
 has large reserves of tar sands, located north and northeast of 

Edmonton
, 

Alberta
.


Physical properties that distinguish heavy crudes from lighter ones include  higher 
viscosity and 
specific gravity, as well as heavier molecular composition. Extra heavy oil from the Orinoco region has a 
viscosity of over 10,000 
centipoise and 10  


API gravity

 4. Generally a 
diluent is added at regular distances in a pipeline carrying heavy crude to facilitate its flow. 


Some 
petroleum geologists categorize 
bitumen from 
tar sands as extra heavy oil although bitumen does not flow at 
ambient conditions. 



 Economics 


Heavy crude oils provide an interesting situation for the economics of petroleum development. The Resources of Heavy oil in the world are more than twice of those conventional light crude oil.  On one hand, due to increased 
refining costs and high sulfur content, heavy crudes are often priced at a discount to lighter ones.  The increased viscosity and density also makes production more difficult (see: 
reservoir engineering).  On the other hand, large quantities of heavy crudes have been discovered in the Americas including 

Canada
, 

Venezuela
 and 


Northern California

. The relatively shallow depth of heavy oil fields (often less than 3000 feet) contributes to lower 
drilling costs.




Chemical properties

 
Heavy oil is 
asphaltic. It is  heavy  (dense and viscous) due to the high ratio of 
 naphthenes to 
paraffin (linear 
alkanes). Heavy oil has over 60 carbon atoms and hence a high boiling point and molecular weight. For example, the 
viscosity of Venezuela's Orinoco extra-heavy crude oil lies in the range 1000-5000 
 cP, while Canadian extra-heavy crude has a viscosity in the range 5000-10,000 cP, about the same as molasses, and higher (up to 100,000 cP for the most viscous commercially exploitable deposits).1
A definition from the 


Chevron Phillips

 Chemical company is as  follows:


The  heaviness  of heavy oil is primarily the result of a relatively high proportion of a mixed bag of complex, high molecular weight, non-paraffinic compounds and a low proportion of volatile, low molecular weight compounds. Heavy oils typically contain very little paraffin and may or may not contain high levels of asphaltenes.5





 Environmental impact 


As a rule, heavy crudes have a more severe environmental impact than light ones.  With more difficult production comes the employment of a variety of 
enhanced oil recovery techniques, including steam flooding and tighter well spacing, often as close as one well per acre.  Heavy crudes also carry contaminants. For example, Orinoco extra heavy oil contains 3.5% 
sulfur as well as 
vanadium and 
nickel.
http://www.worldenergy.org/wec-geis/publications/default/tech_papers/17th_congress/3_1_04.asp Heavy crude oils contain more carbon in relation to hydrogen, thus releasing more carbon dioxide (a 
greenhouse gas) per amount of usable energy when burned.


Advanced technologies are mitigating the environmental impact via horizontal wells and increased energy efficiency, but, barrel for barrel, heavy crudes will likely always be more environmentally damaging than light crudes.




 Origin 


Most geologists agree that crude becomes  heavy  as a result of 
biodegradation, in which lighter ends are preferentially consumed by bacterial activity in the reservoir, leaving heavier hydrocarbons behind.  This hypothesis leans heavily on the techniques of 
petroleum geochemistry.

In 
mathematics, in the area of 
statistical analysis, the bispectrum is a statistic used to search for nonlinear interactions. The 





Fourier transform




 of the second-order 
cumulant, i.e., the 
autocorrelation function, is the traditional 
power spectrum. The Fourier transform of C3(t1, t2) (third-order 
cumulant-generating function) is called the bispectrum or bispectral density.    Applying the 
convolution theorem allows fast calculation of the bispectrum  B(f_1,f_2)=X^*(f_1+f_2).X(f_1).X(f_2).

They fall in the category of higher-order spectra, or polyspectra and provide supplementary information to the power spectrum. The third order polyspectrum (bispectrum) is the easiest to compute, and hence the most popular.


A statistic defined analogously is the bispectral coherency or bicoherence. 


Bispectrum and 
bicoherence may be applied to the case of non-linear interactions of a continuous spectrum of propagating waves in one dimension 
http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0741-3335/30/5/005. 


Bispectral measurements have been carried out for 
EEG 
signals monitoring 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve db=PubMed list_uids=11046224 dopt=Abstract.


In 
seismology, signals rarely have adequate duration for making sensible bispectral estimates from time averages.

A Grubenhaus (pl. Grubenh auml;user compounded from the German Gruben [pit or cavity] haus [house]) is a type of 
sunken floored building built in many parts of northern 
Europe between the 5th and 7th centuries AD. In the UK, they are sometimes also known as 'grubhuts' or 'grubhouses'.


Archaeological evidence indicates they were built in a shallow sub-rectangular pit around 250mm deep and measuring around 2m by 1.5m. Within this pit were placed two substantial wooden posts in 
postholes at either end of the long axis. It is likely that a suspended wooden floor lay over the pit and that the cavity beneath was used for storage or to control damp although other interpretations consider that grubenhauser did not have suspended floors at all. A 
gabled roof supported by the timber posts covered the hut which likely had no windows and had a single entrance at one end.


Grubenhausen are usually interpreted as domestic dwellings although their small size and that they can be found near to other buildings and associated finds of 
loom weights has led to theories that they had a specialised purpose such as 
weaving sheds.

Trinomial name



Maccullochella peelii mariensisRowland, 1993






























Mary River Cod (Maccullochella peelii mariensis) are a 
Maccullochella cod found in the coastal 



Mary River


 system of southern 




Queensland



, 

Australia
.  Mary River Cod are significant because they are the most northerly of the four 
Maccullochella cods found or once found in coastal river systems of eastern Australia.



Description


A large fish, reliably recorded to at least 27 kilograms in the early years of European settlement. Very similar in appearance to 
Murray Cod and 
Eastern Freshwater Cod; a striking looking, deep-bodied fish with dark green or black mottling.  Curiously, Mary River Cod have a slightly shorter, thicker caudal peduncle (tail wrist) than the other cod species.




Conservation


Mary River Cod are subject to the usual story of woe. Incredibly abundant at the time of first European settlement, they were grossly overfished with nets, lines and explosives by the early European settlers and, as with other Maccullochella cods, were even used as pig feed. This overfishing, combined with the massive siltation of their habitats by land-clearing, destruction of riparian vegetation and cattle trampling river banks, and dams and weirs blocking migration, rapidly caught up with this large, slow-growing, long-lived Maccullochella cod species, as it has with all its close relatives.






Classification


Taxonomically, Mary River Cod are designated as  Maccullochella peelii mariensis , which denotes that they are a sub-species of the 
Murray Cod, Maccullochella peelii peelii.  This was done on the basis of examination of muscle proteins and enzymes.  (This designation of Mary River Cod as a sub-species of 
Murray Cod was actually the cause of the Murray Cod's recent name change from Maccullochella peeli to Maccullochella peelii peelii.)


Two recent genetic research projects using 
mitochondrial DNA, which offers far more resolution, indicate that Mary River Cod were in fact more closely related to 
Eastern Freshwater Cod, Maccullochella ikei, of the 



Clarence River


 (the most southerly of the four coastal cod populations) than they are to 
Murray Cod.  If this finding is correct then it suggests that Mary River Cod should be renamed Maccullochella ikei mariensis to denote that they are a sub-species of 
Eastern Freshwater Cod.  If this finding is correct it also, logically, suggests that 
Murray Cod only crossed the 


Great Dividing Range

 via a natural river capture event once, into the Clarence River system, and that the four coastal cod populations (Clarence, Richmond, Brisbane and Mary Rivers) were all sub-species of 
Eastern Freshwater Cod of the Clarence River.  Dramatic drops in sea-level during glacial periods (aka  
Ice Ages ) and/or  lateral  river capture events could easily have seen these four coastal river systems linked at times and 
Eastern Freshwater Cod gaining access to each one.

Biography


Mellette was the son of Charles Mellette and was born in 

Henry County, Indiana
.  He was educated at Marion Academy.  In 1862, Mellette entered 
Indiana University as a sophomore and graduated in 1863.  On 
October 6, 
1864, Mellette enlisted in Company H of the 9th Indiana Volunteers, serving as a conscripted soldier until mustering out on 
September 28, 
1865.  He served in the army as a substitute for his older invalid brother and experienced many humiliations as a result.  In 1866, Mellette graduated from the School of Law at the Indiana University and went to 

Muncie, Indiana
, where he began practicing law with Thomas J. Brady.  On 
May 26, 
1866, he married Margaret Wylie.  Mellette was elected as district attorney for 

Delaware County, Indiana
.  In 1870, he purchased the  Muncie Times  and made the newspaper very influential and prosperous.  During that same year, Mellette was elected the county superintendent of schools.


When his wife became ill, Mellette visited western states to find a climate that would be beneficial to her.  Mellette's family eventually settled in 

Springfield
, 
Dakota Territory, for two years; and, Mellette served as register of the United States Land Office in Springfield until the land office was moved to 

Watertown
, Dakota Territory, in 1880.  In October 1885, the Republicans nominated Mellette for governor of Dakota Territory.  In November 1885, Mellette ran unopposed for the office of governor; and, voters selected 

Huron
 as the temporary capitol of Dakota Territory.  In 1889, voters approved the new constitution for South Dakota and elected Arthur C. Mellette as South Dakota's first Governor.  On 
November 2, 
1889, President 



Benjamin Harrison


 signed the proclamation to make 





South Dakota




 the fortieth state. 

Mellette County, South Dakota
 is named in his honor.

The third USS Worden (DD-352) was a 



Farragut-class


 
destroyer in the 






United States Navy





 during 







World War II






. She was named for 


















John Lorimer Worden

















.


Worden was laid down on 
29 December 
1932 at the 
Puget Sound Navy Yard; launched on 
27 October 
1934; sponsored by Mrs. Katrina L. Halligan, the wife of Rear Admiral 














John Halligan, Jr.













, Commander, Aircraft, 
Battle Force; and commissioned on 
15 January 
1935, Commander 
Robert E. Kerr in command.



Pre-World War II


After fitting out, Worden departed Puget Sound on 
1 April 
1935 for her shakedown cruise that took her first to 

San Diego, California
, and thence along the coast of Lower 

California
 and 








Mexico







 to 
Puerto San Jose, 

Guatemala
, and 

Puntarenas
, 






Costa Rica





. The new destroyer then transited the 
Panama Canal on 
6 May and steamed north to 

Washington, D.C.
, where on 
17 May she embarked Rear Admiral 
Joseph K. Taussig, Assistant Chief of Naval Operations, along with a congressional party, for a cruise down the 



Potomac River


 to 
Mount Vernon.


Worden subsequently returned to the 







Washington Navy Yard






 where her guns were disassembled for alterations. She then shifted south on 
21 May to the 
Norfolk Navy Yard. In the ensuing weeks, the ship underwent voyage repairs at Norfolk. The yard work was broken once by trials and tests off 

Rockland, Maine
, and completed in the early summer. She ultimately left the Norfolk Navy Yard on 
1 July and spent the weekend of the 4th at 

New Bedford, Massachusetts
, before setting her course for the west coast. After proceeding via 








Guantanamo Bay







 and the Panama Canal, she arrived back at the 
Puget Sound Navy Yard on 
3 August.


After a post-shakedown refit at her builders' yard, Worden shifted south to San Diego, reaching that port on 
19 September, and commenced four years of operations from there as a unit of Destroyer Squadrons, 
Scouting Force. She performed valuable duty as a training ship for the Fleet Sound School, San Diego, and conducted the usual tactics and type training evolutions in local waters and in maneuvers that took her from 

Seward, Alaska
, to 

Callao
, 






Peru





. She also participated in regularly scheduled fleet problems and battle tactics with combined forces of the 



United States Fleet


 in the 


Caribbean Sea

 and in the 
Hawaiian Islands. One of the highlights of her operations during that time came in the autumn of 1939. In mid-September  Worden, in company with 



Hull (DD-350)


 and escorting the 
aircraft carrier 



Ranger (CV-4)


 voyaged to Callao, Peru, for a visit that coincided with the Inter-American Technical Aviation Conference at 

Lima
. While Ranger proceeded independently homeward upon conclusion of her visit, the destroyers paused at 








Balboa







, 

Panama Canal Zone
, before returning to San Diego. 


The coming of war in 
Europe on 
1 September 
1939 altered Worden's pattern of operations out of San Diego. Five days after hostilities began in 

Poland
, the Navy commenced its 
Neutrality Patrol duties on 
6 September. On 
22 September, the 





Chief of Naval Operations




 directed the Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet to transfer, temporarily, to the Hawaiian area two heavy 
cruiser divisions, a destroyer flotilla flagship (a light cruiser), two destroyer squadrons, one destroyer tender, an aircraft carrier, and base force units necessary for servicing those ships. That dispatch marked the establishment of the Hawaiian Detachment the forerunner of the ultimate basing of the Fleet at Pearl Harbor.


Worden was attached to this new force, commanded by Vice Admiral 
Adolphus Andrews, whose flag flew in the heavy cruiser 











Indianapolis (CA-35)










. On 
5 October 
1939, she sailed for Pearl Harbor.


Worden worked primarily in the Hawaiian Islands over the next two years, interspersing her time at Pearl Harbor and its environs with regular periods of upkeep on the west coast. Upon the conclusion of 
Fleet Problem XXI in the Spring of 1940, the entire Fleet was based in Hawaiian waters.




Pearl Harbor


On the morning of 
7 December 
1941, during the 
attack on Pearl Harbor, Worden lay in a nest alongside destroyer tender 











Dobbin (AD-3)










, receiving upkeep. She suffered no damage in the 
Japanese attack, but one of her gunners, Quartermaster 3d Class 
Raymond H. Brubaker, shot down a bomber with a .50-caliber Browning machine gun. Within two hours of the commencement of the attack, Worden had gotten underway and was proceeding to the open sea.


Although, in the operational plans for the attack, Japanese submarines were supposed to attack American ships as they emerged from Pearl Harbor, their attempts to carry out the mission failed. The danger of enemy submarines, however, did exist; and purported submarine sightings proliferated. 


Worden picked up a submarine contact at 1240  well over three hours after the attack by the enemy aircraft had been completed and dropped seven depth charges. That afternoon, the destroyer joined a task force built around the light cruiser 










Detroit (CL-8)









, the flagship of Rear Admiral 
Milo Draemel. Searching the seas southwest of 

Oahu
, Worden rendezvoused with the fleet oiler 








Neosho (AO-23)







 and escorted her to a fueling rendezvous with Admiral 
Aubrey W. Fitch's Task Force (TF) 11 built around the aircraft carrier 



Lexington (CV-2)


. 


While Neosho fueled the ships of TF 11 on the morning of 
11 December, Worden assumed a screening station on Lexington's bow and the next night escorted Neosho away from danger when 



Dewey (DD-349)


 discovered what looked like a surfaced enemy submarine and went on the offensive. After having seen Neosho to a safe haven at Pearl Harbor, Worden returned to the open sea on 
14 December as part of the covering force moving toward 

Wake Island
. The Wake Island Relief Expedition was recalled on the morning of 
22 December; and the island fell two days before Christmas. 




1942


Worden returned to patrol and escort operations in the Hawaiian Islands; and, while thus engaged with the Lexington task force, twice dropped depth charges on suspected enemy submarine contacts off Oahu on 
16 January 
1942 and again six days later.


Detached from TF 11 on the last day of the month, Worden left Pearl Harbor on 
5 February to escort the seaplane tender 



Curtiss (AV-4)


 and the fleet oiler 







Platte (AO-24)






, via 

Samoa
 and the 
Fiji Islands, to 

New Caledonia
, and reached 
Noumea on 
21 February. Three days later, when the merchantman SS Snark struck a mine in 
Bulari Passage, Worden went to her assistance, passing a tow line to the sinking ship and pulling her clear of the channel entrance. Worden's medical department tended six injured men, and the ship brought the crew safely to port. 


Departing Noumea on 
7 March, Worden in company with Curtiss set course for Pearl Harbor and reached that port on the 19th. That day, the destroyer entered the navy yard there and, after her repairs had been finished, joined TF 11 on 
14 April.


Worden headed out to sea on the 15th, in company with the Lexington task force, bound for a rendezvous area southwest of the 




New Hebrides



 Islands, where, on 
1 May, they joined Rear Admiral 

Frank Jack Fletcher
's TF 17, built around the carrier 



Yorktown (CV-5)


. On the 2d, after the two carrier task forces had fueled, Worden was detached to escort the fleet oiler 



Tippecanoe (AO-21)


 to Noumea. In her absence, the American carriers engaged in the 
Battle of the Coral Sea.


On 
12 May two days after she reached Noumea  Worden was joined in that port by the cruisers and destroyers of the former Lexington task force.  Lady Lex  had succumbed to massive internal explosions and fires started during the battle. As part of that group, Worden put to sea on the 13th and, the following day, rendezvoused with TF 16 off Efate in the New Hebrides. Formed around the carriers 



Enterprise (CV-6)


 and 



Hornet (CV-8)


, this force was commanded by Vice Admiral 
William F. Halsey.



Battle of Midway


TF 16 reached Pearl Harbor on the 26th. Worden sailed on 
28 May with TF 16 the force now under the command of Rear Admiral 

Raymond A. Spruance
, who had replaced Halsey. Later, TF 17  formed around the hurriedly repaired and replenished Yorktown rendezvoused with Spruance's force to the north of 
Midway Island.


Worden screened Enterprise and Hornet throughout the 

Battle of Midway
 from 4 to 
6 June 
1942. Worden returned to Pearl Harbor on the 13th and was soon assigned to the screen of a revitalized TF 11, built around the newly repaired 



Saratoga (CV-3)


. The destroyer escorted Saratoga as she sailed to Midway and flew off reinforcement groups of 









Army








 and 







Marine Corps






 aircraft before returning to the Hawaiian Islands for training.


On 
9 July, Worden headed for the South Pacific with Saratoga's task force but was temporarily detached on the 21st to escort Platte to Noumea, reaching that port four days later. While Platte took on her vital cargo to replenish ships of the carrier task force, Worden patrolled the harbor entrance. On the 28th, Worden and Platte got underway to rejoin Saratoga.


En route on the first night out, Worden sighted signal lights in the darkness. She soon took on board 36 survivors of the sunken Army transport Tjinegara which had been torpedoed on the 25th by the 
Japanese submarine I-169 and sunk about 75 miles southwest of Noumea.


Worden returned to the Saratoga group to the south of the Fiji Islands on the following day, when the carrier forces joined marine-laden troop transports that had sailed from Wellington, New Zealand, for the invasion of the 
Solomon Islands. Her stay with the carrier was brief, for the destroyer was soon detached to escort the fleet oiler 







Cimarron (AO-22)






 to Noumea, where she landed the Tjinegara's survivors on 
1 August.


Worden caught up with TF 16 on 
3 August and, shortly before daybreak on the 7th, was screening Saratoga as the carrier launched air strikes against Japanese positions on 

Guadalcanal
 and 










Tulagi









 preparatory to the landings. 




Battle of the Eastern Solomons


For the next two weeks, Worden operated with Saratoga south of the Solomons protecting supply and communication lines leading to Guadalcanal. During the 

Battle of the Eastern Solomons
, Worden screened the flattop as she launched air strikes in company with Enterprise to sink the 
Japanese carrier Ry j '' and damage the seaplane tender Chitose. Less than a week later, however, 



Japanese submarine I-26


 torpedoed Saratoga and put her out of action, necessitating a trip to the mainland United States for repairs.


Worden screened Saratoga's retirement via 


Tongatapu

 in the 
Tonga Islands to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 
23 September. Five days later, she sailed with two other destroyers screening the 
battleships 










Idaho (BB-42)









 and 










Pennsylvania (BB-38)









 for the west coast of the United States. She reached 

San Francisco, California
 on 
4 October but departed again a week later with 



Gansevoort (DD-608)


 to accompany Idaho to Puget Sound where they arrived on the 14th. Worden soon returned south to San Francisco and later joined Dewey in screening Nevada during her post-repair trials in the San Pedro-San Diego area.





Grounding





USS Worden being abandoned shortly after a hull breach beneath the engine room, 
12 January 
1943.



On 
27 December 
1942, Worden sailed from San Francisco to support the occupation of 
Amchitka Island in the 

Aleutian Islands
. She reached 
Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on New Year's Day 1943 and, on 
12 January, was guarding the transport 
Arthur Middleton (AP-55) as that transport put the preliminary Army security unit on the shores of 
Constantine Harbor, Amchitka Island. The destroyer maneuvered into the rock-edged harbor and stayed there until the last men had landed and then turned to the business of clearing the harbor.


A strong current, however, swept Worden onto a pinnacle that tore into her hull beneath her engine room and caused a complete loss of power. Dewey passed a towline to her stricken sister and attempted to tow her free, but the cable parted, and the heavy seas began moving Worden totally without power  inexorably toward the rocky shore. The destroyer then broached and began breaking up in the surf; Comdr. 
William G. Pogue, the stricken destroyer's commanding officer, ordered abandon ship; and, as he was directing that effort, was swept overboard into the wintry seas by a heavy wave that broke over the ship.


Pogue was among the fortunate ones, however, because he was hauled, unconscious, out of the sea. Fourteen of his crew drowned. Worden, herself, was a total loss. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 
22 December 
1944.


Worden earned four 
battle stars for her World War II service.

WDAF-TV


Local TV LLC

Fox 4




WDAF-TV is a 

FOX
 affiliated television station in 
Kansas City, MO.  The station is owned by 
Local TV LLC, the media arm of private equity firm 
Oak Hill Capital Partners. Its transmitter is located in 

Kansas City, Missouri
.

It runs 49 hours a week of locally produced newscasts, as well as first-run prime time and sports programming from Fox. It also runs off-network sitcoms, talk shows, reality shows, sports and court shows. 



History



WDAF began operation on 
October 16, 
1949 as the second television station in Missouri and the first in Kansas City.  The station was originally owned by the 
Kansas City Star along with WDAF radio (610 AM, now 

KCSP
), which began operations in 1922.  It was affiliated with all four major networks of the time: 

NBC
, 

CBS
, 

ABC
, and 

DuMont
.  It was a primary NBC affiliate owing to WDAF-AM's long affiliation with NBC Radio.


Randall Jessee was the station's first anchorman. Several other notables, including 




















Shelby Storck



















 (WDAF-TV's first weathercaster) and future Hollywood character actor 

Owen Bush
, did announcing for the station during the early 1950s. When 






KMBC-TV





 signed on in 1953, CBS and Dumont programming moved there.  WDAF shared ABC with KMBC until later in 1953, when KCMO-TV (now 






KCTV





) signed on as the CBS affiliate.  KMBC and WDAF then affiliated exclusively with ABC and NBC respectively.  The station pre-empted moderate amounts of NBC programming, usually some daytime shows and occasionally a prime time show.


In 1953, the federal government began antitrust action against the Star over its broadcasting properties (WDAF-TV, WDAF-AM and WDAF-FM).  The investigation was reportedly opened at the behest of 
Harry Truman, who had a long-running feud with the Star.  The court ruled against the Star in 1955.  After appeals failed, it signed a consent decree in 1957 requiring it to sell its broadcasting properties.


In 1958, WDAF-AM-FM-TV was sold to Transcontinent Broadcasting.  Transcontinent merged with 








Taft Broadcasting







 on 
April 1, 
1964.  Taft was renamed Great American Broadcasting on 
October 12, 
1987.  By that year, WDAF had overtaken KMBC as the dominant station in Kansas City, as was the trend at many NBC affiliates.  Great American became Citicasters in 1993. 


On 
July 13, 
1984, WDAF-TV became one of the first 20 NBC stations in the country to receive network programming via satellite.  In 1986 WDAF-TV also became the first TV station in Kansas City to broadcast in stereo.  



As a Fox station


In the winter   spring of 1994, WDAF was sold to 



New World Communications


 (along with 

Phoenix's
 






KSAZ





).  Shortly after the sale was announced, New World also announced that its stations were to affiliate with the Fox network.  This came after Fox picked up the contract to carry the NFC game package from CBS.  


As such, WDAF became a Fox affiliate on 
September 12, 
1994 and the NBC affiliation moved to 
KSHB Channel 41, the old Fox station. As a Fox affiliate, WDAF was the only New World-owned station to be a former NBC affiliate; sister stations 






WVTM-TV





 in Birmingham and 






KNSD





 in San Diego were sold to 

NBC Universal
.  In most cases, the previous affiliation of any New World owned station was mostly CBS or ABC.


After the affiliation swap, WDAF increased its local news programming from 30 hours a week to 50 hours - including expansions in morning and evening news.  While it carries the entire Fox lineup, WDAF has pre-empted 

Fox Kids
 programming from the beginning, of which instead aired over the years on 






KSMO





 and later 






KMCI





 (now 

4Kids TV
); the pre-emption has been common among its newer Fox sister stations as well in the same timeframe since the mid-1990s. WDAF was the first station in Kansas City to use a helicopter for traffic and news reporting.


WDAF officially became a Fox 
owned and operated station in 1997, following Fox's purchase of the New World station group.  WDAF was the only O O of any major network in the Kansas City market.  


The station was the over-the-air flagship station of the 


Kansas City Royals

 for many years, long after many Big Three affiliates dropped regular coverage of local sports.  It lost the broadcast rights for the games in 1992, marking the end of a 13-year business relationship. The station also produced and aired 









Kansas City Chiefs








 pre-season games from 1997 to 1999, upgrading the local production presentation to network quality standards. The contract ran through the 1999 season.



September 23, 
2005, WDAF-TV began broadcasting in full power high definition, going from an HD signal rated at 1.2 Kilowatts to a signal strength of 1000 Kilowatts.


In 2006, WDAF-TV officially debuted its new website based on the MyFox platform (which has also been adopted by all the other Fox O O's). On 
October 23, 
2007, starting with FOX 4 News at Noon, WDAF-TV acquired the Fox O O graphics and 



music


 package, which was adopted by all other Fox O O's. Minor changes were made in the studio to match the new theme. 



December 22, 
2007, Fox entered into an agreement to sell WDAF and seven other Fox O O stations1 to 
Oak Hill Capital Partners' 
Local TV LLC, which currently owns nine stations formerly of 

The New York Times Company
. The sale was closed on 
July 14, 
2008.





News Operation







ambox-notice  style=  









 Please help 
improve this article or section by expanding it. Further information might be found on the  or at . 
(September 2008)''




WDAF-TV broadcasts a total of 49 hours of local news per week (with five hours on weekdays, 4  hours on Saturdays and three hours on Sundays), giving the station more hours of local news than any other station in Kansas City and more than any individual station in both Missouri or Kansas. 


WDAF-TV uses a news helicopter,  Sky Fox  for traffic and breaking news reporting.  The station also has a 
Hummer  Storm Fox  equipped to track and chase storms along with Sky Fox. 




Ratings


Dating back to when WDAF was an NBC affiliate, the station has usually battled Hearst-owned KMBC (and at times, KCTV also) for the #1 spot in local news in Kansas City. During the late 1970s and into the 1980s, WDAF-TV was in second place behind KMBC, but the station ended the latter decade as number one station in the Kansas City market. As soon as the station switched from NBC to Fox, KMBC made a short resurgence to number one in the market. WDAF-TV has since rotated between first and second place with either KMBC or KCTV in various timeslots since the late 1990s after the network switch. WDAF-TV is just one example of a few Fox stations that have actually outcompeted NBC, ABC and CBS affiliates in local newscasts.


According to Nielsen Media Research, as of February 2008, WDAF-TV has Kansas City's #1 newscast in some timeslots, including at 9:00pm (beating competition from KCTV's 9:00 p.m. newscast on KSMO, and network programming on KMBC, KSHB and KCTV). WDAF-TV currently battles KMBC-TV for first place in morning news, and with KMBC and KCTV for either first or second in evening news. The station's 10:00 p.m. newscast placed third behind KMBC and KCTV, however.

Trivia





WDAF-TV (along with a few other television and radio stations in the US) is an exception to the FCC rule that call signs must start with K west of the Mississippi River and W east of it.  This is because Kansas City was east of the original K/W line.

__TOC__



For the living animal, see 
Duck.For other uses, see 
Duck (disambiguation).

Duck refers to the meat of several species of bird in the 
Anatidae family, found in both 
fresh and 
salt water. Duck is eaten in many 
cuisines around the world.



Types of ducks


The most common duck meat consumed in the 








United States







 is the 




Pekin duck



. Because most commercially raised Pekins come from 







Long Island






, 





New York




, Pekins are also sometimes called  Long Island  ducks, despite being of Chinese origin. Some specialty breeds have become more popular in recent years, notably the 
Muscovy duck, and the Moulard duck (a 
sterile hybrid of Pekins and Muscovies 
http://www.duckhealth.com/dmstduck.html). Unlike most other domesticated ducks, Muscovy ducks are not descended from 
mallards.


According to the 

USDA
, nearly 26 million ducks were eaten in the U.S. in 2004. 
http://www.usda.gov/nass/pubs/agr05/05_ch8.PDF  




Duck meat





Duck breast with apple-honey sauce and wild rice









Braised duck, 
Teochew style






 Smoked and fried 
zhangcha duck





The meat of a duck is mostly on the breast and the legs. The meat of the legs is darker and somewhat fattier than the meat of the breasts, although the breast meat is darker than the breast meat of a 
chicken or a 
turkey. Being 
waterfowl, ducks have a layer of heat-insulating subcutaneous 
fat between the skin and the meat.
Boneless duck breast is also called  magret  and can be 
grilled like 
steak, usually leaving the skin and fat on.


Internal organs such as 
heart and 
kidneys may also be eaten; the 
liver in particular is often used as a substitute for goose liver in 
foie gras.


A duck has less meat than a roasting chicken of the same overall size. Cooks when portioning roast duck should give a quarter of a duck per portion. Attempts to get more portions out of a roast duck tend to result in some portions having a fair amount of meat and other portions being mostly skin and bone.




Dishes


Duck is used in a variety of dishes around the world, most of which involve roasting for at least part of the cooking process to aid in crisping the skin. Notable duck dishes include:



 
Foie Gras: a specially fattened and rich 
liver, or a 
pate made from the liver, sometimes taken from a duck but usually from a 
goose


 








Peking Duck







: a 
Chinese dish, where a roasted duck is served with pancakes and Hoisin Sauce


 
Turducken: an 








American







 dish that comprises a turkey, stuffed with a duck, which is in turn stuffed with a chicken.


 
Pressed duck: a complex dish originally from 








Rouen







, 

France
.


 
Confit: duck legs that have been 
cured (partly or fully) in 
salt, then marinated and poached in duck fat, typically with 
garlic and other herbs. The French word confit means  preserved , and the French name for duck confit is  confit de canard.

Londonderry is a 
suburb of 

Sydney
, in the state of 




New South Wales



, 

Australia
. Londonderry is located 60 
kilometres west of the 


Sydney central business district

, in the 
local government area of the 

City of Penrith
 and is part of the 


Greater Western Sydney

 region. 


History


Londonderry takes its name from the 1831 grant of 30 acres to Thomas Kendall.




Geography


Londonderry is located in the northernmost part of the 

City of Penrith
 with the Driftway forming the boundary with the 
Hawkesbury City Council area. The Northern Road divides Londonderry from 

Berkshire Park
 while 

Cranebrook
 and 

Agnes Banks
 are its boundaries on its southern and western sides. Londonderry is a rural area and much of it still crown land. Because of its closeness to 

Richmond
 and distance from Penrith, the suburb has always had stronger links with Richmond than with Penrith. 




Commercial Area


Londonderry village in the centre of the suburb is a vital community connection point for local residents in the area. With its spacious environment this suburb hosts several state government agencies, some of national and international importance. It is home to the Foursquare church owned Camp Elim which is situated on Bennett Road.

Mohammad Sabir  Baburaj  (also known as M. S. Baburaj, 

Malayalam
:          ) was a 

Malayalam
 music composer. He is often credited for the renaissance of Malayalam film music.


Early years


His early childhood was spent in destitution and poverty. His father,Jan Khan, who was a 
Hindustani musician from 


Bengal

 who frequently held concerts in 

Kerala
, deserted his 

Malayali
 mother when he was very young, and returned to his native 

Kolkata
. Baburaj thus became a semi-orphan, often singing songs in trains to make a living. But as luck would have it, a policeman, Kunjahammed (he was called Kunjahammed Ka), an enthusiast of music, from his native town of 








Kozhikode







, noticing the boy's vocal talents, decided to adopt him.




Music career


One of his greatest achievements was the introduction Hindustani strains into Malayalam popular music. He successfully composed melodies based on Hindustani 
Ragas and blended Malayalam lyrics in them. Most of the lyrics were written by eminent poets of Kerala like 






P. Bhaskaran





 and 

Vayalar
. 


Baburaj though a successful composer, was never a careerist. He was known to be an alcoholic and finally died nearly a pauper. Today, various clubs and musical organisations conduct many stage programs in honor of Baburaj (Babuka to his own townspeople), and their earnings are handed over to his family. The 

Manorama Music
 company, chanced upon an old audio cassette of Baburaj rendering some of his own compositions. It was recorded during those heady musical evenings that Baburaj and his friends occasionally indulged in during the 1960s. The cassette was re-mixed and became an instant hit.

Roualeyn George Gordon-Cumming (
15 March, 
1820- 
24 March, 
1866), 

Scottish
 traveller and sportsman, known as the  lion hunter . He was the second son of 
William Gordon Gordon-Cumming, 2nd Baronet.

From his early years he was distinguished by his passion for sport. He was educated at 

Eton
, 

England
, and at eighteen joined the 
East India Company's service as a 




cornet



 in the 
Madras Light Cavalry. The climate of 

India
 not suiting him, after two years experience he retired from the service and returned to Scotland. 


During his stay in the East he had laid the foundation of his collection of hunting trophies and specimens of 
natural history. In 1843 he joined the Cape Mounted Rifles, but for the sake of absolute freedom sold out at the end of the year and with an ox wagon and a few native followers set out for the interior. He hunted chiefly in 
Bechuanaland and the valley of the 

Limpopo River
, regions then swarming with big 
game. In 1848 he returned to the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.


The story of his remarkable exploits is vividly told in his book, Five Years of a Hunter: Life in the Far Interior of South Africa (

London
, 1850, 3rd ed. 1851). Of this volume, received at first with incredulity by stay-at-home critics, 


David Livingstone

, who furnished Gordon-Cumming with most of his native guides, wrote: I have no hesitation in saying that Mr. Cumming's book conveys a truthful idea of 

South Africa
n hunting (Missionary Travels, chap. vii.).


His collection of hunting trophies was exhibited in London in 1851 at the 
Great Exhibition, and was illustrated by a lecture delivered by Gordon-Cumming. The collection, known as The South Africa Museum, was afterwards exhibited in various parts of the country. In 1858 Gordon-Cumming went to live at 










Fort Augustus









, Scotland, on the 








Caledonian Canal







, where the exhibition of his trophies attracted many visitors. He died there in 1866.


An abridgment of his book was published in 1856 under the title of The Lion Hunter of South Africa, and in this form was frequently reprinted, a new edition appearing in 1904.

March 18, 
1877) was a 
United States 
political figure. Born in 1800 in 

Leicester, Massachusetts

Governor of Massachusetts





 from 1854 to 1855. He was elected as a member of the

In his attempt at re-election in November 1854, he fell victim to the Know Nothing wave in Massachusetts and was soundly trounced by the Know Nothing candidate, former Websterite Whig 
Henry J. Gardner, receiving only 21% of the vote.


Along with distant cousin 

Ichabod Washburn
, he helped found 

Worcester Polytechnic Institute

John Charles Dent (
November 8, 
1841   
September 27, 
1888) was a 

Canadian
 journalist, author and historian.

He was born in 

Kendal
, 

Westmorland
, 

England
. Shortly after his birth, his family emigrated to 
Canada West.


Dent received his primary education in Canadian schools, studied law in 

Brantford, Ontario
, and became an attorney in 1865. He practised law for a few years, but found the profession did not suit him, and was drawn to pursue literary endeavours instead. He accordingly relinquished his practice as soon as he felt himself in a position to do so, and went to England.


He developed his journalistic skills working for 

The Daily Telegraph
. He also contributed a series of articles to the periodical 
Once a Week.


At this period he had a wife and family depending on him for support, and it speaks well for his abilities, that he was able to amply provide for them out of the profits solely derived from his literary labours. To do this he had to devote himself to work that could be quickly written, and readily sold. Accordingly, Dent produced no very long or ambitious work in England.


After remaining in England for several years, Dent and his family moved to America in 1867. He obtained a position in 
Boston, which he held for about two years. Then he went to 

Toronto
, having accepted a position on the editorial staff of the 










Toronto Evening Telegram









, which was then just starting. For several years Dent devoted himself to journalistic labours on various newspapers, but principally the Toronto Weekly Globe. To that journal he contributed a very notable series of biographical sketches on  Eminent Canadians. 


In 1880, soon after the death of 






















George Brown





















, founder of the Globe, Dent severed his connection with that paper and began his first ambitious undertaking, The Canadian Portrait Gallery (1880), which ran to four large volumes. It contained biographies of Canadian public figures, living and dead, carefully prepared, and written from an un-partisan standpoint. This book attained a considerable circulation, and brought to its author a comparatively large sum of money.


Dent's second book was The Last Forty Years: Canada since the Union of 1841. This work has been highly praised in all quarters.


His third work was a History of the Rebellion in Upper Canada (1885 6). Through careful research, from sources of information previously not accessible,  Dent was able to throw new light on the characters of the men who took part in the 

Upper Canada Rebellion
. This work met with severe criticism when first published, as it contradicted commonly-held beliefs at the time.


In writing history, he was in accord with 
Thomas Babington Macaulay. He always believed that a true story should be told as agreeably as a fictitious one;  that the incidents of real life, whether political or domestic, admit of being so arranged as, without detriment to accuracy, to command all the interest of an artificial series of facts; that the chain of circumstances which constitute history may be as finely and gracefully woven as any tale of fancy. 


Dent has been compared to 









Francis Parkman








 for his ability to write about Canadian history without being dull and dry.


In addition, he wrote a great many sketches, essays and stories. A collection of his stories was published posthumously in The Gerrard Street mystery and other weird tales. (1888)


Dent was elected to fellowship in the 



Royal Society of Canada


 in 1887.


In private life, Dent possessed qualities of mind and heart, having their visible outcome in a courteous, genial manner that endeared him very closely to his friends. With all his wealth of learning, which was very great, he was light-hearted, witty and companionable.

L.


































 Common Gypsyweed in Oregon



Veronica officinalis (Heath Speedwell, Common Speedwell, Common Gypsyweed,  Paul's Betony) is a species of 
Veronica, native to 
Europe and western 



Asia


. 

It is a 
herbaceous 
perennial with hairy green stems 10 50 cm long that cover the ground in mats and send up short vertical shoots which bear soft violet flowers. The 
leaves are 1.5 5 cm long and 1 3 cm broad, and softly hairy.


It flowers from May until August



Cultivation and uses


This speedwell grows in fields and takes hold in areas that have been disturbed. It is a potential 
weed if its seed gets into collections of 
agricultural seed, such as 
alfalfa. Historically the green parts of the plant have been used 
medicinally for coughs, 
otitis media, and gastrointestinal distress. The plant is rich in vitamins, 
tannins, and the 
glycoside 
aucuboside. Aucuboside, which is also found in many other 
Plantaginaceae species, is thought to have antiinflammatory properties. Extracts are widely sold as herbal remedies for 
sinus and ear infections. It has been introduced to North America and is widely 
naturalised there.

In 
corpus linguistics a keyword is a word which occurs in a text more often than we would expect to occur by chance alone. Keywords are calculated by carrying out a statistical test (e.g., loglinear) which compares the word frequencies in a text against their expected frequencies derived in a much larger corpus, which acts as a reference for general language use. 
AntConc is a freely available text analysis tool capable of calculating keywords.

David Timothy Scarboro1 (
February 3 
1968   
April 27 
1988) was a 











British actor










 who was best known for portraying 


Mark Fowler

 in the popular 











British










 
soap opera 

EastEnders
.


 Career 



Early career


David made his acting debut in a little-known 
television film titled Good Neighbours which aired in 1984. The following year, he appeared as an extra in Series 7 of the school drama series 

Grange Hill
.




 EastEnders 





David Scarboro as 


Mark Fowler

.



From its inception in February 1985 until April of that same year, Scarboro played the part of Mark Fowler in the 

BBC
 
soap opera 

EastEnders
. The actor did not respond well to the sudden fame the role brought him, and later became very concerned when the writers decided that the character of Mark should become a 
racist. 


Things came to a head one day when the script called for a scene where Mark was to deliver racist abuse to 

Paul J. Medford
's character, 


Kelvin Carpenter

; Scarboro firmly refused to play the scene; it was decided that he should leave the show.


In December 1985, he briefly returned to the series in a special storyline where Mark was reunited with his parents, who had travelled to visit him in 

Southend-on-Sea
 where he had settled with an older woman who had children from an earlier relationship. Scarboro later returned for brief stints in 1986 and 1987, but never returned to the series on a permanent or on-going basis. Scarboro's last appearance in the series was on 
Christmas Day, 1987.





Media intrusion and suicide


Elements of the UK 
tabloid press reported that Scarboro had been fired from the show for turning up late for filming and being uncooperative on set. Away from the series Scarboro initiated 
libel proceedings after several national papers published inaccurate stories about his private life, but the press continued to pursue him and his family. The 

News of the World
 discovered that Scarboro was in a 
psychiatric unit, and published photographs of the place. Scarboro subsequently left the unit because he could no longer get adequate treatment, and inaccurate stories about his condition were being published. 


He committed 
suicide in 1988 by throwing himself from 




Beachy Head



. A documentary on his life was produced by the 

BBC
 in 1988 titled My Brother David and was presented by his brother Simon. His parents left the country soon after their son's death.


The role of Mark Fowler was subsequently taken by 

Todd Carty
 in 1990 and continued in EastEnders as a regular character until 2003.

Rosemary Tonks (born 1932) is an 

English
 poet.  She published her adult poetry from about 
1960 to 1972. What has happened to her since the 1970s remains unknown.12


 Early life 


Rosemary Tonks was born in 

London
2 and educated at Wentworth School, London.  Expelled in 1948, she published a children's story in the same year.  She married at age 19, and the couple moved to 

Karachi
, where she began to write poetry. Attacks of 
typhoid and 
polio forced a return to England. She later lived briefly in 

Paris
.3




 Career 


She worked for the 

BBC
, writing stories and reviewing poetry for the BBC European Service.  She published poems in collections and 

The Observer
, the 

New Statesman
, Encounter and Poetry Review; she read them on the BBC's  Third Programme . She also wrote  poetic novels .3


Her work appears in many anthologies, including 
Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry (ed. Keith Tuma), 








Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse







, 







British Poetry since 1945






 and The Firebox: Poetry in Britain and Ireland after 1945 (ed. Sean O'Brien).


Tonks stopped publishing poetry in the early 1970s, at about the same time 
as her conversion to fundamentalist Christianity.4 Nothing is known publicly about her subsequent life.2 As 


Andrew Motion

 wrote in 2004, she  Disappeared! What happened? Because I admire her poems, I've been trying to find out for years... no trace of her seems to survive - apart from the writing she left behind. 1 The Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry, which published three of Tonks' poems in 2001, states that permission to use her poems was obtained from a literary agency, Sheil Land Associates, Ltd.3




 Character of her work 


Tonks' poems offer a stylised view of an urban literary sub-culture around 1960 full of hedonism and decadence.  The poet seems to veer from the ennui of 



Charles Baudelaire


 to exuberant disbelief of modern civilisation.  There are illicit love affairs in seedy hotels and scenes of cafe life across Europe and the Middle East; there are sage reflections on men who are shy with women.  She often targets the pathetic pretensions of writers and intellectuals.  Yet she is often buoyant and chatty, bemused rather than critical, even self-deprecating.3


She believed that poetry should look good on a printed page as well as sound good when read:  There is an excitement for the eye in a poem on the page which is completely different from the ear s reaction .5  Of her style, she said  I have developed a visionary modern lyric, and, for it, an idiom in which I can write lyrically, colloquially, and dramatically. My subject is city life with its sofas, hotel corridors, cinemas, underworlds, cardboard suitcases, self-willed buses, banknotes, soapy bathrooms, newspaper-filled parks; and its anguish, its enraged excitement, its great lonely joys. 6


Her poem,  The Sofas, Fogs and Cinemas  ends:


  All this sitting about in cafes to calm down

:Simply wears me out. And their idea of literature!


The idiotic cut of the stanzas; the novels, full up, gross.




I have lived it, and I know too much.

:My cafe nerves are breaking me


With black, exhausting information.7 






 Assessment of her work 


She was praised by critics as a cosmopolitan poet of considerable innovation and originality.  She has been described as one of the very few modern English poets who has genuinely tried to learn something from modern 

French
 poets such as 
Paul Eluard about 
symbolism and 
surrealism.  


Al Alvarez

 said of Notes on Cafes and Bedrooms that it showed  an original sensibility in motion .8 













Edward Lucie-Smith












 said that  the movements of an individual awareness - often rather self-conscious in its singularity - supply the themes of most of her work. 8 Daisy Goodwin commented on her poem,  Story of a Hotel Room , about infidelity,  This poem should be read by anyone about to embark on an affair thinking that it's just a fling. It is much harder than you know to separate sex from love. 9

Street art is any 
art developed in 
public spaces   that is,  in the 
streets    though the term usually refers to art of an illicit nature, as opposed to government sponsored initiatives. The term can include traditional 
graffiti artwork, 
stencil graffiti, 
sticker art, 
wheatpasting and 
street poster art, video projection, 
art intervention, guerrilla art, 
flash mobbing and 
street installations. Typically, the term Street Art or the more specific Post-Graffiti is used to distinguish contemporary public-space artwork from territorial graffiti, 
vandalism, and corporate art.



Owl, Mezer, Moss. Venice Beach, Ca.



The motivations and objectives that drive street artists are as varied as the artists themselves. There is a strong current of 
activism and 
subversion in urban art. Street art can be a powerful platform for reaching the public, and frequent themes include adbusting, 
subvertising and other 
culture jamming, the 
abolishment of private property and 
reclaiming the streets. Other street artists simply see urban space as an untapped format for personal artwork, while others may appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with installing illicit artwork in public places. However the universal theme in most, if not all street art, is that adapting visual artwork into a format which utilizes public space, allows artists who may otherwise feel disenfranchised, to reach a much broader audience than traditional artwork and galleries normally allow.


Techniques


Whereas traditional 
graffiti artists have primarily used free-hand 
aerosol paints to produce their works,1  street art  encompasses many other media and techniques, including;



 
Wheatpasting


 



Sticker art





 
Stencil art


 
Mosaic tiling


 Video projection


 
Woodblocking


 
Street installations


 Murals




Traditional graffiti also has increasingly been adopted as a method for advertising; its trajectory has even in some cases led to its artists' working on contract as graphic artists for corporations.2 Street art is a label often adopted by artists who wish to keep their work unaffiliated, and strongly political. Street artists are those whose work is still largely done without official approval in public areas.


For these reasons street art is sometimes considered  post-graffiti  and sometimes even  neo-graffiti .3 Street art can be found around the world and street artists often travel to other countries foreign to them so they can spread their designs.

Key locations





Further information: 
Melbourne street art

















Berlin














 (Germany) has attracted attention to international street artists since the reunification of the city making it one of Europe's street art strongholds. A lot of bizarre post-communist locations, cheap rents and ramshackle buildings gave rise to a vibrant street art scene. Hotspots there are 



Mitte


, 



Prenzlauer Berg


, 

Kreuzberg
 and 



Friedrichshain


.




Bristol
 (U.K.) also is part of a vibrant street art scene due to the rise of  Art terrorist  





Banksy




.




Melbourne
 (Australia) is home to some of the world's most diverse street art (see 
Melbourne street art). There are a number of important sites across the 

Melbourne city centre
. One of the most colourful being 





Hosier Lane




 near 





Federation Square




   
Canada Lane in 

Carlton
. Both boasting some of the finest street art in multiple mediums in Australia and internationally, with street artists such as 





Banksy




, regularly frequenting the streets of Melbourne.



Sao Paulo in 

Brazil
 is generally viewed as one of the capitals of street art, and particularly murals. The lively and colourful atmosphere of the city is reflected in the street art scene, quickly evolving into one of the biggest and best in the world, drawing in many artists from around the world to collaborate.


However many cities are plastered with the scrawls and writing of these artists, any wall is a target, any wall is a canvas.

, The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1982.

As just one example, note the Bronx-based group Tats Cru, whose members began as a subway graffiti crew, but whose work covers traditional neighborhood memorial walls, public schools, hospitals, representation at the Smithsonian Institute's 35th Folk Arts Festival, and also logo and advertising design for such corporations as  Snapple and McDonald's. Some of their work can be found on their website, .

 Neo-graffiti  is a term coined by Tokion Magazine in the title of its Neo-Graffiti Project 2000, which featured  classic  subway graffiti artists working in new media; others have called this phenomenon  urban art.  A discussion by the

Settlements in Manitoba




Pinawa is a small 

Canadian
 community of about 1500 residents located in southeastern 

Manitoba
, 110 kilometres north-east of 
Winnipeg.

The town is situated on the 



Canadian Shield


 within the western boundary of 





Whiteshell Provincial Park




, which lies near the Manitoba-

Ontario
 provincial boundary. The community of Pinawa was originally established in 1901 to support the operation of Manitoba's first 
hydro electric generating station but was abandoned in 
1951 when the site was shut down.


Pinawa was re-established about 10 km from the original Hydro town in 
1963 when 

Atomic Energy of Canada Limited
 built the 






Whiteshell Laboratories





 
nuclear research facility in the area.  Pinawa was chosen as the site for the research station due to the seismic stability of the area.  Pinawa was developed as a 
planned community this preserved many of the natural features of the site and designated all riverfront property as public reserve. Whiteshell Laboratories was somewhat similar to the 
Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories in 









Chalk River, Ontario








.  AECL began decommissioning the Whiteshell Laboratories in 
1998.  The economy of Pinawa is diversifying and now includes the head office of the North Eastman Health Association and a number of environmental science firms.


The Town of Pinawa has a full service Hospital with 24 hour emergency service, Doctor's offices, and an ambulance station. There is a small shopping centre with a Post Office,Credit Union, Grocery Store, Bakery, Hairdresser, and the office of the Pinawa Community Development Corporation. 


Pinawa has two schools: F.W. Gilbert Elementary School for students in Kindergarten up to grade six, with about 95 students, and Pinawa Secondary School for grades 7-12, with about 110 students. The schools of Pinawa comprise their own School District, the School District of Whiteshell. Pinawa Secondary School is located near the elementary school, and is well known in the Whiteshell area for its outstanding Pinawa Panther sports teams and a unique outdoor education program that takes full advantage of the surrounding wilderness.  Students are involved in basketball, soccer, volleyball, badminton, juggling club and travel club as well as academic sports like Reach For The Top and community service activities.


Pinawa is located beside the 



Winnipeg River


, which offers access to boating, kayaking, canoeing, and other water recreational activities. Other attractions include an 18-hole golf course, beach, outdoor pool, tennis courts, a curling rink, a hockey arena and many kilometres of cross-country ski trails. The 
Trans-Canada Trail runs through the town of Pinawa along the Riverside. Pinawa also hosts the Eastern Manitoba Concert Association or EMCA's concerts, held in the community center (the secondary school gym.) once a month from October to April. 


Pinawa is also home to an abundance of white-tailed deer, bears and other wildlife.

Species



See text.




Ledum is a 
genus name formerly widely recognised in the 
family 
Ericaceae, including 8 species of 
evergreen 
shrubs native to cool temperate and subarctic regions of the 
Northern Hemisphere and commonly known as Labrador Tea.


Recent 
genetic evidence has shown that the species previously treated in this genus are correctly placed in the genus 
Rhododendron, where they are now treated as Rhododendron subsect. Ledum.


Because some of the species names used in Ledum could not be used in Rhododendron (the names already having been used for other species already in this large genus), new names had to be coined for them.





Species


The species formerly listed in Ledum, with their current accepted names in Rhododendron, are:



Ledum decumbens = 
Rhododendron subarcticum Harmaja


Ledum glandulosum = 
Rhododendron neoglandulosum Harmaja


Ledum groenlandicum = 
Rhododendron groenlandicum (






Oeder





) Kron   Judd


Ledum hypoleucum = 
Rhododendron hypoleucum (Kom.) Harmaja


Ledum macrophyllum = 
Rhododendron tolmachevii Harmaja


Ledum palustre = 
Rhododendron tomentosum Harmaja


Ledum palustre var. diversipilosum = 
Rhododendron diversipilosum (Nakai) Harmaja


Ledum subulatum = 
Rhododendron subulatum (Nakai) Harmaja







Hybrids


One natural 
hybrid also occurs:



Ledum columbianum = Rhododendron   columbianum (R. groenlandicum   R. neoglandulosum)





Uses


Some species (e.g. L. groenlandicum) have been used to produce 
Labrador Tea.  Other species have varying levels of toxicity (e.g. L. glandulosum). Evergreen Labrador Tea grows slowly, but retains its leaves year-round.  Users should take care not to over-harvest leaves from any single plant.


Ledum sp. often grows together with poisonous plants such as 
Bog-laurel and 
Bog-rosemary, but certain species (e.g. L. groenlandicum and L. palustre) are easily distinguished by the distinctive rust coloured fuzz on the bottom of leaves.

Universities in Shaanxi




Northwest A F University (

Chinese
:         ), formerly known as Northwest Sci-Tech University of Agriculture and Forestry, located in 
Yangling District, 








Xianyang







, 

Shaanxi
, 
China, is a university dominant in the fields of 
agriculture, 
genetics, 
biotechnology, 
forestry, and 
botany.


History


The university was built before the 

Second Sino-Japanese War
. One building remains from that historical time. During the war, Japanese planes flew inland. The elders in the town say that 



Yangling


 was the furthest west point that the planes reached. This historical building suffered extensive damage from a Japanese attack, but was rebuilt to a stable condition. This building, named Building #3, is still used regularly for university classes. This building, designed by an American architect, serves as a clock tower and houses the university's 
radio station.




Campus


The University has two campuses: Xi Lin and Xi Nong. A 
butterfly museum on campus is said to have the most extensive collection of butterflies in the world.


The university hosts a diverse array of students from provinces throughout Western China. 


Restaurants between the two campuses are famous throughout Shaanxi province for their belt-style noodles (noodles as thick as a belt). Some of the best homemade yogurt in Shaanxi province is sold outside the teacher's gate at Xi Nong campus.


The university hosts a large number of students, whose spending supports the economy of Yangling.

Alliance Quebec (AQ) was a group formed in 
1982 to 






lobby





 on behalf of 
English-speaking Quebecers in the province of 

Quebec
, 

Canada
. It began as an 
umbrella group of most English-speaking organizations and institutions in the province, with approximately 15,000 members.  At its height in the mid-1980s, the group had a network of affiliated anglophone groups throughout the province.



 Early Years: 1982-1989 



The 
Parti quebecois, a party that supports the independence of Quebec from 

Canada
 and the exclusive use of 

French
 in most areas of public and business life, won a majority in the 
Quebec National Assembly in 1976.  The vast majority of Quebec anglophones, which at that time made up approximately 13% of Quebec's population (see 
Language demographics of Quebec), did not support this party.  Many anglophones left Quebec during this period; while estimates vary, the number is often estimated at over 100,000 people.    Some anglophones that remained formed local lobby groups to promote 
federalism and argue against new laws such as the 
Charter of the French Language.  After the Parti quebecois was re-elected in 1981, several of these groups joined together in May 1982, as  The Alliance of Language Communities in Quebec  (or  Alliance Quebec ) in an effort to gain more influence and to start a province-level dialogue between linguistic groups.  


With many of its founders being active in the 
Liberal Party of Quebec, AQ's ideology reflected that party's policies of compromise between linguistic groups combined with provincial government promotion of the 

French language
 in the province's public and economic spheres.  Although few political scientists or historians credit AQ with a significant effect on public policy, the organization did receive significant media attention in both Quebec's anglophone and francophone media during the 1980s.  The media often used AQ as a counterfoil to small 
Quebec nationalist groups such as the 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society.  Several of AQ's early members went on to become Liberal cabinet ministers in later years, such as 
Thomas Mulcair.


The group had widespread grassroots volunteer activity in its early years.  It formed over 20 regional chapters, including 8 in the anglophone neighbourhoods of Montreal.  The federal government, in an effort to promote federalist groups in the province, subsidized the group, providing it with more than half of AQ's budget ($1.4 million in 1989).  Pro-federalist businesses, many of which balked at being required to operate exclusively in French under the Parti Quebecois' new legislation, also funded the group.


In addition to the regional chapters, six already-established anglophone groups outside of Montreal became affiliated with AQ and sent delegates to its annual convention.  Quebec's traditional anglophone institutions, such as universities and hospitals, were also allowed to send delegates, but they rarely did so.  In order to accommodate all of these groups, AQ had an exceptionally large board of directors, at 41 people.  Rather than being chosen by the various groups, though, they were elected by a majority of votes at the annual convention, which encouraged slate formation and infighting.  


By the end of the 1980s, AQ claimed to have 40,000 people on its membership list.  Critics charged that people who did not renew their memberships were not removed from this list and that the actual number of dues-paying members hovered around 5,000.


In December 1988, AQ's offices were destroyed in a case of 
arson.  Then-president Royal Orr sued 
Le Journal de Montreal and 
Tele-Metropole, for falsely reporting that he was the  prime suspect  in setting the blaze (the lawsuit was eventually settled out of court)1.




 Middle Years: 1990-1998 



The Liberal Party of Quebec won the provincial election of 1985, with one of their promises being to amend several parts of the Charter of the French Language to allow greater use of English in businesses, and particularly in advertising (which had a particular symbolic value because of the visual effect of black paint on store signs in Montreal, covering up the English text).  This put AQ leaders in a dilemma when the Liberal government did not fulfill this promise, but instead passed special legislation in 1990 overriding a 1989 





Supreme Court of Canada




 decision striking down parts of the Charter of the French Language.   Most of AQ's leaders supported the government's decision, even though the majority of Quebec anglophones did not.  Right-wing critics of the organization dubbed it  Compliance Quebec  and  the lamb lobby  for its perceived unwillingness to challenge the government.  


Some of these critics joined the upstart 

Equality Party
, a protest party that opposed the Liberals' legislation and had surprising electoral success in 1990, winning four seats in the 

National Assembly
.  It quickly shrank due to infighting, garnering only 0.3% of the vote in 1994.  Having been rebuffed at the ballot box, most of its remaining members (numbering approximately 200) instead concentrated on winning elected positions in Alliance Quebec in order to have the group promote the Equality Party's platform (notably, favouring a complete repeal of all mandatory use of French in Quebec, and partitioning Quebec in the event of independence).  Public infighting between so-called  moderates  (sympathetic to the Liberal Party) and  radicals  (the remaining members of the Equality Party) within AQ throughout the 1990s, along with a gradual decrease in interest among the general Quebec population in political issues involving language, led to the marginalization of AQ in the province's politics.


With infighting at the level of the board of directors, the grassroots elements of the group became increasingly inactive. Government funding allowed for a permanent staff for the group, which relied increasingly less on volunteers.   Regional chapters, such as those in Quebec's 



Magdalen Islands


, Lower North Shore and 

 Baie-Comeau
 closed down for lack of members, while six chapters on the Island of Montreal merged in order to avoid closing.




 Final Years: 1998-2005 



In May 1998, a  radical  president was elected, 
Montreal Gazette columnist 









William Johnson








. He won mainly with support of the tiny 

Equality Party
, and he in turn supported its members for places on AQ's board of directors.  Johnson initially made headlines by holding demonstrations against businesses that did not place English on their in-store advertising (which was once again legal after amendments to the Charter of the French Language in 1994). Johnson also had AQ's constitution amended to add his view that Canada's federal government should refuse to recognize a Quebec unilateral declaration of independence.  The increased publicity soon gave way to a negative reaction from AQ's former supporters, which ultimately left the group without enough support to continue:





 half of the group's board of directors (those not associated with the Equality Party) quit the group en masse in April 1999;


 after a rise under Johnson 
http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2000/02/01/bill001201.html, membership declined steadily (4,806 members in May 1998; 2,440 members in August 2001; 1,551 members in December 2003); 


 all affiliated groups broke ties with AQ by 2001;


 several of AQ's regional chapters dissolved themselves and formed under new names to avoid being associated with AQ;


 private donations dropped over 90% from 1998 to 2003, with corporate donations stopping completely;


 the federal government, its main sponsor, decreased funding by 69% between 2000 and 2004.  When the 

Department of Canadian Heritage
 discontinued its grant in 
2005, which was at that point the source of more than 90% of AQ's funding, the group became 
insolvent and ceased activity.

Yaya Diallo (born 1946) is a Malian (
Fienso, 








Koutiala Circle







, 


Sikasso Region

, 

French Sudan
 (now 

Mali
)) drummer, author, and recording artist in the genres of traditional African music and 
world music. He specializes in the goblet-shaped hand drum called 
djembe.


 Background 



Diallo was born to a nomadic 

Peul
 father and a 

Minianka
 (
Bamana)1 mother, and was raised in a culture that works, worships, lives and breathes to the beat of the Drum. An instrument for transmitting traditional knowledge among the Minianka, the drum is the focal point of Diallo's life story and his link, through the universal medium of music, with the Western world.




 Musical career 



Diallo's educational background includes a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from the 
Universite de Montreal and training in a variety of African instruments: Minianka tam-tam (talking drum), 


Senufo

 
balafon (
xylophone), 
Mandingo tama, or 
talking drum, and the 


Afro-Cuban

 
congas. His 1980 debut album Nangape, an instrumental album of African drumming, balafon and flute music, brought recognition to his profound knowledge of traditional African healing arts. He has performed throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. He is the co-author of The Healing Drum: African Wisdom and Teaching, and has released a CD by the same name, as well as several other CDs.

The Mick Molloy Show is a 
television program that appeared on the 

Nine Network
 in 

Australia
 for just 8 weeks during 1999. The host, 









Mick Molloy








, was a widely acclaimed comedian from 












The Late Show











 and 
Martin/Molloy. Running Time (less commercial breaks) was approximately 1 hour 50 minutes.


The show was essentially a laid back, easy-going chat variety format, with a set comprising a couple of couches, a coffee table and resident band. The regular weekly guest band featuring acts not normally seen on commercial televisional, added to the musical interludes. All this was combined with a some pre-recorded sketches, movie reviews, a sport segment, regular guests, local comedians to create a relaxed, urban/warehouse vibe. The lead-in shows were the iconic 

Hey Hey It's Saturday
 and 

The Pretender
.


The premise of the show was that some mates would gather together on a pair of couches on a Saturday night. It was a variety show, with comedy,  and musical performances. 


At the time the Mick Molloy Show was in pre-production, the popular comedy movie  had just been released, featuring the character 
Mini-me. In episode 1 
Tony Martin brought many gifts for Mick for his first show including a new side-kick for Mick called Mini-Mick, a vertically-challenged replica of Mick, parodying 
Mini-me. Mini-Mick was played by 






Arthur Serevetas





 (often credited as 'Arthur Penn'). Mini-Mick's catch phrase was  Blow it out your arse!  and was generally a more vulgar version of Mick, often yelling obscenities at people. Mini-Mick appeared in all eight episodes of The Mick Molloy Show. 


Assisting Molloy in this live-to-air two hour shambles were his comedy cronies 

Tony Martin
, 

Judith Lucy
, 









Bob Franklin








 and 





Dave O'Neil




, bandleader 








Paul Hester







 and The Largest Living Things, film critic 
Leigh Paatsch, 
Puppetry of the Penis star 
Simon Morley and Channel Nine stalwart 


Pete Smith

. 


Some of the show's guests were 


Glenn Robbins

, 
Mark Little, 


Alan Davies

, 
Stephen Curry, 




Ben Folds Five



, 


Spiderbait

, 


The Fauves

, 

Mach Pelican
, 



Colin Hay


 and 











Stephen Cummings










.


In its short time, the program caused considerable controversy. The very first sketch of the show portrayed Molloy appearing to be drunk, and appearing to urinate on the set with his back to camera. The show was widely panned by critics, and generated many complaints.


The show was originally contracted for 20 episodes, but was taken off air after the 8th. In that time, Molloy was reportedly paid over AUD $1 million.



Axing


The Mick Molloy Show was unconventional compared to many other mainstream live variety shows on Australian television at the time. Many speculate that it was the infamous  Pilot  sketch during episode one which caused so much controversy. The show was axed after eight episodes. It is believed that the cast and crew were informed of the axing from Nine management during the week following episode eight, although this has not been confirmed. Another setback for the final show was the fact that 
Tony Martin and 

Judith Lucy
 were still in 

Edinburgh
 for the Comedy Festival and, although they appeared live via satellite, many viewers believed it would have been appropriate to have them in the studio, given their enormous contribution to the show.


Mick was quoted in an interview with the 
Sydney Morning Herald, 1/11/2005:  It must be perceived as a failure but I still look on it as one of the most informative periods,  he says.  I'm still very proud of it and, in a perverse way, I enjoyed it. It's good to pick yourself up out of the rubble, dust yourself off and wonder, 'What now?'  


While many dedicated followers of 









Mick Molloy








 agree the show was not brilliant 100% of the time, it was beginning to find its feet in the last few weeks prior to its axing.




Sketches   Segments



The Pilot


This one-off viewing of the pilot was a mock-up of a pilot episode which was recorded and replayed on the first episode. This sketch contains the infamous scene of an alcohol affected Mick urinating on the set, with his back to camera. Many who didn't even see the sketch, assumes Mick was drunk and live to air, but the complaints in the media in the following days increased.




Checking on the Neighbours


With a distinct inner city vibe and armed with a pair of binoculars, Mick was tempted to look  beyond the set  and peer into the windows of his neighbours. At the rear of the set was some large windows which looked out onto the neighbourhood. The end result was pure visual comedy. Some of Mick's neighbours were less than appealing, most were just freaky.




In Search of the Couches



This pre-recorded sketch was aired during Episode 1 to set up the story of how the two couches were selected for the show's set. This involved Mick and Simon Morley  testing  various couches (jumping on them, sleeping in them etc.). The sketch was recorded at  The Couch Potato  in Melbourne, which is no longer trading. 




How Delightful












Bob Franklin








 introduced a single pre-recorded sketch, with a live introduction around the coffee table covered with a full complement of cups of tea and cucumber sandwiches. As the weeks  progressed, the evening supper expanded to include cakes and an array of other finger food, even doilies. 








Paul Hester







 became caught up in the eloquent atmosphere and began serving the refreshments in an apron, in an effeminate manner. One particular hilarious sketch involved Stephen Curry being gunned down for using sandwich bread when making toast.




 Who would you sleep with if you were gay? 



A one-off sketch from episode 1, Mick poses the question to various cast and crew  Who would you sleep with if you were gay? . 









Bob Franklin








 promptly reminds Mick that  gay  can also mean bright and cheerful.


The following responses from the cast and crew were: 





 Mick: Detective

Episode Guide


The show went out live at 9:30 Saturday nights on the Nine Network from GTV 9's Studio 2 in Melbourne, and was broadcast to 

Sydney
 and 

Adelaide
. Although the show has never been repeated, 

Tony Martin
 has indicated numerous times that he would like The Mick Molloy Show to be released on DVD with a front cover which would have the words  a televisual shitheap  with a picture of a burning television set! 





Episode 1


Broadcast: 10/07/1999
Run time: 110 minutes



  The Pilot Episode  - Band Leader Paul Hester remarks how he thought they didn't nail the pilot episode. In response, Mick cuts to a sequence from the pilot where a drunk Molloy starts sobbing on stage and goes searching for new beer after he vomited in the one he was carrying at the time.


 My photo's up the foyer - Mick decides to take a mobile camera out of the studio to walk to reception to see his photo in the foyer. Jokes ensue including remarks about 


Glenn Ridge's

 photo making him look like he's on the crapper doing number two's, and the photo 


Marcus Graham

 looking like something out of a porn advertisement saying call me, call me now. Upon arriving in the foyer he converses with switchboard staff before panning across at the photos of 

Eddie McGuire
, 











Daryl Somers










, and then himself - standing up near naked in a pair of blue Y Fronts.


 Musical act - 


Spiderbait




 Guest - 

Judith Lucy
 and Molloy talk about their earlier TV performance days, including a sketch on 












The Late Show











 involving scenes from The Blue Lagoon where Lucy was wearing a coconut bra, and Molloy was in a loincloth.


 Couches - As part of the promos for the show, there was significant focus on the couches as part of recreating a lounge room feel for the set. To the tune of Save Tonight by Eagle Eye Cherry, Molloy and three of the writing staff show their travels in search of the couches for the set including visits to the Psychologist, antics in Furniture Stores including interrupting the shooting of an advertisement, a couch on the bucking bull at a local saloon, couch crash testing, and interrupting a stage show of 






Todd McKenney





 in 

The Boy from Oz
 during Rio where Molloy rides onto stage with a wheeled couch being pushed by Brazilian dancers.


 Guest - Judith Lucy talks about piss, and how people ruin perfectly good alcohol by pouring it into coffee or other drinks resulting in a series of advertisements for Frangecillo. This is before cutting to a sketch about the placement of Government health warnings on bottles of alcoholic beverages.


 Guest - 









Bob Franklin








 and Molloy discuss turning down offers to advertise and participate in advertisements for the Adult Literacy Board, before Lucy and Ros Kelly appear on stage as part of a faux advertisement for the same board. Then moves to a sketch titled Bob's Scrapbook covering the life and times of Bob Franklin. Flashbacks include a job interview, a discussion with the local investigative team of the police force about not wanting a girl to join in the investigation, and a 
taxi ride where he is asked by the driver if he has ever engaged in 
homosexual 
sex.


 Musical Number - House band


 Guest - 
Tony Martin talking politics and commenting on 


John Howard's

 can-do country. They then cut to footage as a present to Molloy for his first show, of a live show sequence from 

In Melbourne Tonight
. The sequence, ordered destroyed by the 

Nine Network
 at the time of its broadcast, which Martin is alleged to be in possession of the only known copy, depicts 

Bert Newton
 watching over two persons on stage participating in a challenge to see whom could finish drinking from a 
yard glass first. As the challenge was being completed, the contestant on the right was unable to hold his liquor after five minutes and subsequently vomited. Segment host Newton took it in his stride, and moves across frame front of the vomiting contestant with perfect timing and simply carried on with the segment. Mick then gets to presenting his second present, a 
midget to be known as Mini Mick (Played by 






Arthur Serevetas





), enters stage with 

Victoria Bitter
 in his hand muttering  [indechiperable]... stuff the lot of ya  before removing a pack of Winfield Blues and Molloy commenting if he'd like to join him and Ros for a  two and a halfsome .


 Midget Selection - A sketch showing the selection of Mini Mick, including a number of tasteless midget jokes before the entry of a tuxedo wearing 


Pete Smith

 wanting to audition as a midget before leaving unhappy and uttering the lines  blow it out your bot-bot . The sketch continues with interviews of the three candidates performing impressions of Molloy , before re-enacting the strip sequence from 

The Full Monty
 where towards the end one of the midgets is mauled by a menacing dog seen at the start of the sequence which scared the candidates.

 How Delightful 


 Interview - 
Mark Maher (Kram) from 


Spiderbait




 Who would you sleep with if you were gay - Molloy, Franklin, Martin, Maher, and Hester discuss who they would sleep with if they were gay while eating cucumber sandwiches from a previous segment. Molloy comments he would sleep with 












Andy Sipowicz











, Franklin with 
Jeff Jansz in a threesome with 
Kerri-Anne Kennerly, Molloy with 



Bill Clinton


 just to find out what all the fuss is about, or 
Ricardo Montalban because he knows just how to treat you right, and Maher with 


Homer Simpson

 because he's always had this fascination with cartoon characters and transferring that into sexuality. Hester, commenting he's a hog during sex and likes to be pleasured from head to toe, would like to be in a 

Woody Sandwich
 with 

Todd
 and 

Mark
, before making a number of sexually-related 
innuendos involving the game of 
Tennis. Molloy then continues to pose the question to members of the house band, where the 
guitar player comments he would seek some big love in 

Kim Beazley
. Mini Mick selects 











Daryl Somers










, before the producer comments he would sleep with Molloy.


 Guest - Lee Patch on Entertainment, who refuses a cucumber sandwiches on account he does not eat cylindrical fruit or vegetables. He then continues to talk about film and movie news, before conducting a vox pop on why women go for older men in light of the release of the flim

Fictional companies
VR Troopers




Ziktor Industries is a company owned by the fictional Karl Ziktor, aka 









Grimlord








 in the TV series 

VR Troopers
. The company served as his base of operations from the other side of the reality barrier. It is operated as ruthlessly as the virtual world and is poorly regarded by many of the Crossworld Cities' citizens. However no-one (the Troopers included) is aware that Ziktor and Grimlord are the same person.

Very little is seen of the building bar the exterior, taken from Metalder, and Ziktors' office. Throughout the show's run, the office scenes mostly serve as a bridge into Ziktors' transformation into Grimlord, and most of his actions take place in Virtual Reality than here. The sole piece of equipment is the energy orb (season one) or the energy prism (seasons two) which Ziktor uses to become Grimlord.



Occupants



Ziktor Industries' main occupants are few in number, many episodes are Ziktor surrounded by tall, ice cold women in black leather and high heels, (all of which really are Skugs), a scientist named Strickland (also a Skug), or other agents he had previously attached to assignments and who arrive to report their progress. Ziktor also has a pet lizard called Juliet whom he occasionally strokes and pampers whilst gloating.

IEEE standards




The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association (IEEE-SA) is a leading developer of global industry 
standards in a broad-range of industries, including:




 Power and Energy


 Biomedical and Healthcare


 Information Technology


 Telecommunications


 Transportation


 Nanotechnology


 Information Assurance




IEEE-SA has developed standards for over a century, through a program that offers balance, openness, due process and consensus. Technical experts from all over the world participate in the development of 
IEEE standards. 1



Each year, the IEEE-SA conducts over 200 standards ballots, a process by which proposed standards are voted upon for technical reliability and soundness. 



Standards and the IEEE Standards Development Process


IEEE is one of the leading 
standards-making organizations in the world.  IEEE performs its standards making and maintaining functions through the 


IEEE Standards Association

 (IEEE-SA).  IEEE standards affect a wide range of industries including: power and energy, biomedical and healthcare, 
Information Technology (IT), telecommunications, transportation, nanotechnology, information assurance, and many more.  In 2005, IEEE had close to 900 active standards, with 500 standards under development.  One of the more notable IEEE standards is the 


IEEE 802

 
LAN/
MAN group of standards which includes the 






IEEE 802.3





 
Ethernet standard and the 


IEEE 802.11

 Wireless Networking standard.


The IEEE standards development process can be broken down into seven basic steps, as follows:





Securing Sponsorship: An IEEE-approved organization must sponsor a standard.  A sponsoring organization is in charge of coordinating and supervising the standard development from inception to completion.  The professional societies within IEEE serve as the natural sponsor for many standards.


Requesting Project Authorization: To gain authorization for the standard a Project Authorization Request (PAR) is submitted to the IEEE-SA Standards Board.  The New Standards Committee (NesCom) of the IEEE-SA Standards Board reviews the PAR and makes a recommendation to the Standards Board about whether to approve the PAR.


Assembling a Working Group: After the PAR is approved, a  
working group  of individuals affected by, or interested in, the standard is organized to develop the standard.  IEEE-SA rules ensure that all Working Group meetings are open and that anyone has the right to attend and contribute to the meetings.


Drafting the Standard: The Working Group prepares a draft of the proposed standard.  Generally, the draft follows the IEEE Standards Style Manual that sets  guidelines  for the clauses and format of the standards document.


Balloting: Once a draft of the standard is finalized in the Working Group, the draft is submitted for Balloting approval.  The IEEE Standards Department sends an invitation-to-ballot to any individual who has expressed an interest in the subject matter of the standard.  Anyone who responds positively to the invitation-to-ballot becomes a member of the balloting group, as long as the individual is an IEEE member or has paid a balloting fee.  The IEEE requires that a proposed draft of the standard receive a response rate of 75% (i.e., at least 75% of potential ballots are returned) and that, of the responding ballots, at least 75% approve the proposed draft of the standard.  If the standard is not approved, the process returns to the drafting of the standard step in order to modify the standard document to gain approval of the balloting group.


Review Committee: After getting 75% approval, the draft standard, along with the balloting comments, are submitted to the IEEE-SA Standards Board Review Committee (RevCom).  The RevCom reviews the proposed draft of the standard against the IEEE-SA Standards Board Bylaws and the stipulations set forth in the IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual.  The RevCom then makes a recommendation about whether to approve the submitted draft of the standard document.


Final Vote: Each member of the IEEE-SA Standards Board places a final vote on the submitted standard document. In some cases external members are invited to vote. It takes a majority vote of the Standards Board to gain final approval of the standard.  In general, if the RevCom recommends approval, the Standards Board will vote to approve the standard.

An informal collective of electronic music enthusiasts originally from Southern California, with an informal branch in Northern California called 13 Moontribe. There is no formal membership but participants gather quarterly, sometimes more often, in the Southern, Central and Northern California wilderness, exclusively during a full moon. Organizers intentionally do not promote the parties commercially, having a strictly informal and non-commercial ethos, and only communicate dates and times of gatherings through word-of-mouth in a close knit social network. Despite this Moontribe has become a well-known entity in the North American underground tribal dance community.

The Moontribe Collective has been gathering since circa 1993 to present.

February 1959




KKGO is a commercial 
radio station located in 

Los Angeles, California
, broadcasting on 105.1 
FM.  KKGO airs a 
country music format, branded as - Go Country 105. Slogan, Today's Hits and Yesterday's Favorites.

KKGO-FM was founded by Saul Levine and is still owned by his corporation, 





Mount Wilson Broadcasting




, and remains the only independently owned-and-operated FM radio station licensed to Los Angeles.



History


Saul Levine launched the station at 105.1 in February 1959 as KBCA, and was one of the first FM stations to broadcast from 
Mount Wilson. In 1979, the station changed its 
callsign to KKGO.1 This was prompted by a court challenge from 

KABC
, according to one local podcaster2. The station aired a traditional 
jazz music format until 1989.


When cross-town 
KFAC dropped 
classical music in favor of a popular music format on 
September 20 
1989, KKGO adopted KFAC's displaced classical music format. The official switch from jazz to classical occurred on 
January 1, 
1990, and began with selections from 
Franz Lehar's operetta 






The Land of Smiles





. In 2000, the 
call letters were changed to KMZT to reflect on their rebranding as  K-
Mozart . The KKGO call letters were then moved to AM 1260.


The station began broadcasting an 
HD Radio digital signal in 2005, and Mount Wilson Broadcasting started 
multicasting the programming of its two AM stations, 

KKGO
 in 
Beverly Hills and 
XESURF in the 
Tijuana, Mexico-

San Diego
 
border area, on its HD2 signal, which then had an 
adult standards format known as  Unforgettable 540   1260 . While the AM signals combine to cover much of the 
Southern California area, they were still weak, especially at night in the 

Orange County
 area, and the FM HD2 simulcast helped boost the reach of the format.




Switch to country



On 
August 17, 
2006 at 10:20 a.m. Pacific time, 

KZLA
's format was changed to 
rhythmic adult contemporary music. After the station played  

Tonight I Wanna Cry
  by 

Keith Urban
 to end the old format, KZLA played  
Let's Get It Started  by the 


Black Eyed Peas

 and changed its moniker to  Movin' 93.9 .  Displaced listeners took notice, prompting a campaign to bring the format back to the Los Angeles airwaves, as well as a response from the 

Country Music Association
, which vowed to work with a broadcaster in the area to help fill the void, as evidenced in this 
article from R R.


At the time, the change left the two largest 
media markets in the 








United States







 and three of the top four without a full-time country music station.   The 

New York
 area hasn't had such a station since 

WYNY
 signed off in 2003 and as of today is still without an outlet for the format. In the 



San Francisco Bay Area


, 

KZBR
 also changed format in 2006, only to return to it after 
Entercom took over the station in March 2007. The other top-3 market, 
Chicago, is served by 

WUSN
. 


On October 27th at just after 5pm AM 540 began airing radio personalities. The personalities included 

Brian Douglas
 (Former KZLA radio personality) in the morning, other former KZLA personalities that joined the station in October 2006 included Shawn Parr, Whitney Allen, Paul Freeman, and Tonya Campos. 


On December 1st, 2006, Mount Wilson Broadcasting added 1260AM to the stations that would be playing country music. after the change of Mount Wilsons' AM stations KKGO and XESURF to a country format, they became  Country 540   1260,  Along with the added frequency, they also made some changes in the radio personalities on the station, replacing 

Brian Douglas
 with Shawn Parr and Robin Banks (not to be confused with 

Robin Banks
) in the Morning Show slot. 


At 5 a.m. February 27th 2007, in a surprise move announced only three days earlier, citing declining ad revenues for the classical format,Mt. Wilson Broadcasters flipped classical KMZT (K-Mozart) to country KKGO (Go Country 105), marking the return of country music to the FM dial after a six month hiatus. Saul Levine swapped the formats and callsigns of FM 105.1 with AM 1260, bringing the country format and the KKGO calls back to FM, while the classical format and the KMZT calls were moved to AM, with the  K-Mozart  format now being simulcast on the FM station's HD2 subchannel. (XESURF continued to play country music, first simulcasting KKGO's format, but later splitting its programming from that of KKGO). After playing 
Mozart's  String Quartet no. 23 in F, K.590 , Los Angeles was left once again without a commercial classical music station on the analog FM dial. However, opening the new morning show with

 Go Country 105  brought country music back to the FM dial after a six-month absence which was a dream come true for the country music fans who had spent those six months writing letters, making phone calls, wearing  I Want My Country Music Back  shirts, handing out and wearing 
Save Country Music Ribbons'', letting anyone know who would listen that they wanted their country music back letting the broadcasters and many others know that there were many reasons that the country music genre would be a viable asset for an LA radio station.


On 
October 29, 
2007, KMZT changed back to its older 

KGIL
 call letters and dropped the classical format in favor of a 
talk radio format. 
 KMZT-AM is to become talk station KGIL ,

Han Dynasty imperial consorts
83 deaths
62 births




Consort Liang (   , personal name unknown) (62(?)-83?), posthumous title Empress Gonghuai (    , literally,  the kind and righteous empress ), was an imperial consort to 










Emperor Zhang of Han









.  She gave birth to his son Liu Zhao (  ) in 79, but her son was adopted by Emperor Zhang's wife 











Empress Dou










 and would not know his birth mother's identity until a long time later, after he became emperor (as 










Emperor He









).

Consort Liang was a daughter of Liang Song (  ), the son of one of 










Emperor Guangwu









's officials, Liang Tong (  ).  When she was 15, in 77, both she and her older sister became consort to Emperor Zhang (who was then 20).


At the time Consort Liang's son Prince Zhao was adopted by Empress Dou, Emperor Zhang had already created his son Liu Qing (  ), by another favorite, 







Consort Song






, 
crown prince.  Empress Dou made false accusations against Consort Song and her sister (also an imperial consort), however, and the Consorts Song were forced to commit suicide in 82.  Crown Prince Qing was deposed, and Prince Zhao was created crown prince in his stead.


The Liang clan did not dare to celebrate openly, but they were happy about that development.  Empress Dou and her clan were not pleased, and, wanting to make sure that the Liangs would not step in and exert influence on the young prince, they also made false accusations against Liang Song, and he was arrested and died in prison in 83.  His family was exiled to modern northern 

Vietnam
.  Consort Liang and her sister died in sadness, probably in 83 as well.  Her son would succeed to the throne in 88, believing that Empress Dowager Dou was his mother.


After Empress Dowager Dou died in 97, officials revealed to Emperor He that Consort Liang was actually his birth mother.  While Emperor He rejected a recommendation to posthumously demote Empress Dowager Dou, he reburied his mother and aunt with great honors (but not with his father -- that honor was reserved for Empress Dowager Dou, as his father's wife).  He also posthumously rewarded his mother the title of empress.

A humidity indicator card (HIC) is a card on which a moisture-sensitive chemical is impregnated such that it will change color when the indicated 
relative humidity is exceeded. This item is an inexpensive way to quantify relative humidity levels inside sealed packaging. They are available in many configurations and used in many applications, especially military and semiconductor.


The most common humidity indicator cards change color from blue (less than indicated RH level) to pink (greater than indicated RH level). Base chemical is 
cobalt(II) chloride). United States Military Specification 
Mil-I-8835A is the governing specification for a humidity indicator card. The humidity indicator card is also specified for use in 
J-STD-033 which is the standard for Handling, Packing, Shipping and Use of Moisture/Reflow Sensitive Surface Mount Devices, also known generically as semiconductors.  This is a joint standard developed by the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council and 
IPC and is used in semiconductor packaging.



History



The need for an easily read humidity indicator that could not be damaged by vibration was identified during World War II.   Rear Admiral Welford C. Blinn, at that time the Commander of the USS Pope, became concerned about the poor condition of the weapons and ammunition arriving in the Pacific Theater.  High humidity in the South Pacific, coupled with poor packaging methods, was causing corrosion and moisture damage.  A significant amount of ordinance was arriving in an unstable, and sometimes dangerous, condition.  Following the end of the war R. Admiral Blinn was assigned to Washington, D.C. where he had the use of a research lab.  There he developed the concept for the first color change humidity indicator, a simple  go/no-go  method of monitoring humidity.  


In the late 1940 s, Relative Humidity in the range of 30-35% was the concern because this is when corrosion can begin.  For 50 years, industrial and military applications for color change humidity indicators were the primary market for these products.  R. Admiral Blinn founded Humidial Corporation in 1948 Acquired by 
Sud-Chemie, Inc. in 1989 to commercialize humidity indicators.


In the mid-1980 s decedents of R. Admiral Blinn, began working with manufactures of semiconductors to identify and resolve the problem of  pop corning .  It was determined that  the solder mounting of semiconductors, also known as devices, onto boards can cause  pop corning  of certain types of surface mount packages if they have been improperly stored or handled. This package delamination occurs as excessive moisture within the package expands as a result of the rapid thermal changes experienced during solder mount operations. As a result an industry wide standard for packaging of semiconductors was released in 1989.  This standard, EIA 583, called for the use of humidity indicator card that would indicate as low as 10%.  Adherence to proper storage and handling methods immediately reduced the number of failures in the semiconductors, but over the years it became apparent that even humidity levels under 10% were detrimental to the devices.  Once again, the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC), now the standards body for semiconductor packaging, went to the decedents of R. Admiral Blinn to determine the feasibility of making a 5% color change humidity indicator.  In April 1999, J-STD-033 was released with a 5, 10, 15% color change indicator card specified.  




Cobalt Free Humidity Indicator Cards





Cobalt Free Humidity Indicator Card



Cobalt-free brown to azure(
copper (II) chloride base) HIC's can be found on the market. In the year 1998 


European Community

 (EC) has issued a directive (adapting to technical progress for the 25th time Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labeling of dangerous substances) which classifies 
cobalt(II) chloride compounds containing Cobalt Chloride percentages (w/w) between 0,01 and 1 as an T (Toxic) and R49 (may cause cancer if inhaled).
As a consequence new cobalt-free humidity indicator cards have been developed by some companies.


Although the EC issued this directive, it does not ban humidity indicators that contain 
cobalt(II) chloride which has been a common misconception.  The only effect the EC directive has on a humidity indicator card that contains 
cobalt(II) chloride is setting labeling requirement thresholds. 
There are two way of considering the EC directive:
1) The cobalt based HIC producers says that if a humidity indicator is considered an article in the EC definition and therefore has no labeling requirements if the % of 
cobalt(II) chloride by weight is 0.25%.  The T (toxic) and R49 (may cause cancer if inhaled) is not applicable because a humidity indicator cannot be inhaled.
2) On the other hand, if you consider HIC as a chemical (indicating spot) on a paper card (indicator) the consequence is that it should be considered as a is a preparation, the concentation limit changes to 0,01 Cobalt and it should be labeled as T (toxic) and R49 (may cause cancer if inhaled).  Moreover it is clear that the HIC can not be ihaled, but the regulation is about the content of substances and is a warning for used, for example if they know the harmful substances in the HIC they will avoid to burn them.




HICs in Semiconductor Packaging



For semiconductor packaging, HICs are packed inside a moisture-sensitive bag, along with the desiccant, to aid in determining the level of moisture to which the moisture-sensitive devices have been subjected.


JEDEC is the leading developer of standards for the solid-state industry and sets the standards for semiconductor packaging.  The latest JEDEC standard, the Joint Industry Standard for the  Handling, Packing, Shipping and Use of Moisture/Reflow Sensitive Surface Mount Devices  J-STD-033B, sets forth the use and testing of humidity indicator cards in the dry packaging of semiconductors.  HICs are used to ensure that the humidity within dry packed barrier bags remains at safe levels for surface mount devices.  In the past, HICs for the semiconductor industry have indicated relative humidity (RH) levels of 5, 10 and 15 percent.  However, JEDEC and IPC released JSTD-033B in 2005, which requires the use of an HIC that indicates RH levels of 5, 10 and 60 percent.  


The standard includes the use and testing of humidity indicator (HI) cards in the dry packaging of semiconductors.  The methods outlined in the standard are prescribed by JEDEC and IPC to avoid damage like cracks and delamination from moisture absorption and exposure to solder reflow temperatures that can result in yield and reliability degradation.


The stipulations of J-STD-003B state:


1)	HICs must adhere to a standard, minimum color-change quality level to ensure accuracy and readability between dry and humid states:  The Color Meter Test Method, quantitatively determines the accuracy of color change HICs.  The levels, as outlined in the J-STD-033B revision, require a  significant, perceptible change in color  between noted humidity levels.  Manufacturers are required to test their cards for accuracy using a colorimeter device and be required to provide a test report to the customer certifying that the HIC meets quality requirements.


2)	HICs must indicate humidity levels for MSL 2 Parts, in addition to MSL 2a to 5a:  Whereas previous cards used a 5, 10 and 15 percent relative humidity spot system to indicate humidity exposure levels for moisture sensitive components, the new HIC will now feature spots indicating 5, 10 and 60 percent.  The change means that cards will now indicate humidity exposure for Level 2 MSL devices.  Additionally, a positive reading on the 60 percent spot indicates that cards should not be re-used, as the high levels of humidity to which the card has been exposed will jeopardize the accuracy of low (5% RH) readings.  The 5, 10, 60 percent cards are complaint with Europen Community Council Directive 67/548/EEC as long as they do not contain more than the applicable amount of cobalt chloride.  


The full standard can be downloaded from 
JEDEC.




Maximum Irreversible Humidity Indicator Cards



Maximum Humidity Indicator Cards are specially designed cards that monitor relative humidity levels in cargo applications. Each level of humidity is represented by a blue crystal that dissolves to create a large blue spot that clearly indicates the highest relative humidity level that has been reached.  Maximum Humidity Indicator Cards are irreversible, thus indicating the highest level of humidity experienced by cargo during its voyage, regardless of current (potentially lower) humidity levels.  Maximum Humidity Indicator Cards provide a clear, unmistakable means of determining if goods have been exposed to damaging humidity levels during their journey.  If the card indicates high levels of humidity, users know check their products for possible damage or modify their packaging regimen accordingly.

Pabo Post Prydain was a king somewhere in the 
Hen Ogledd or Old North of 
sub-Roman Britain.

According to 

Old Welsh
 genealogies, which were largely produced to prove a monarch's royal pedigree, Pabo Post Prydain (Pabo Pillar of 
Britain) inherited his kingdom from his father 
Arthwys Ap Mor, a great grandson of 
Coel Hen. Historians conjecture that he may have ruled in the 







Pennines






 or around 





Papcastle




 in 

Cumberland
 (now 
Cumbria) in the 
6th century. Pedigrees of descent for two of his sons - 









Sawyl Penuchel








 and 









Dunod Fawr








 - are known, perhaps suggesting a later division of his kingdom. 


Pabo is sometimes identified with Saint Pabo who died and is buried at 
Llanbabo on 





Anglesey




. If so, he presumably abdicated in order to retire in the west.

Malarone anti-malaria tablets, as issued in the UK.



Atovaquone (alternative spelling: atavaquone) is a chemical compound that belongs to the class of 
naphthalenes. Atovaquone is a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, an analog of 
ubiquinone, with antipneumocystic activity. Its 
average wholesale price is about $2.13 per standard 250 mg. tablet.1 It is also manufactured in the US in the liquid form, or oral suspension, under the brand name Mepron.2

Atovaquone is a medication used to treat or prevent:



 
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), although it is not approved for treatment of severe PCP.


 
Toxoplasmosis. The medication has antiparasitic and therapeutic effects.


 
Malaria. It is one of the two components (along with 
proguanil) in the drug Malarone. Malarone has fewer side effects and is more expensive than 
mefloquine.3













Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole







 (TMP-SMX, Bactrim) is generally considered first line therapy for PCP or toxoplasmosis. However, atovaquone may be used in patients who cannot tolerate, or are allergic to, TMP-SMX. In addition, atovaquone has the advantage of not causing 
myelosuppression, which is an important issue in patients who have undergone 
bone marrow transplantation.



Malaria


Atovaquone is only available as a fixed preparation with 
proguanil that has been commercially available from 

GlaxoSmithKline
 since 2000 as Malarone (sometimes abbreviated A+P).  It can be used both to treat and to prevent malaria.


A  standard  tablet of Malarone contains 100 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 250 mg of atovaquone. A  pediatric  tablet of Malarone contains 25 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 62.5 mg of atovaquone.



Treatment


The adult treatment dose is four  standard  tablets once a day for three days.  In children, the drug is prescribed by body weight:



11 to 20 kg: 1  standard  tablet once daily for 3 days;


21 to 30 kg: 2  standard  tablets once daily for 3 days;


31 to 40 kg: 3  standard  tablets once daily for 3 days;


41 kg and above: use adult dose.


Malarone is not licensed for use in children weighing 10 kg or less.  The  pediatric  tablets are not used in malaria treatment.


The advice of a specialist should always be sought when starting malaria treatment.  Malarone should not be used to treat severe malaria, when an injectable drug (
quinine or 
artesunate in the UK; 
quinidine in the US) should be used instead.




Prevention


Medical advice should always be taken before choosing a drug for malaria prevention. Because some strains of malaria are resistant, Malarone is not effective for malaria prevention in all parts of the world. It must be taken with a fatty meal or at least some milk to be absorbed adequately.


The adult dose is one  standard  tablet daily starting one or two days before traveling into a malaria-endemic area, and continuing throughout the stay and then for another 7 days after returning from the malarious area.


The child dose is prescribed according to body weight:



11 20 kg: 1  pediatric  tablet once daily;


21 30 kg: 2  pediatric  tablets once daily;


31 40 kg: 3  pediatric  tablets once daily;


41 kg and above use adult dose.


The duration of treatment is the same as for adults.




Resistance


Proguanil acts as a 
mitochondrial sensitiser and synergizes with atovaquone; also, there is a high natural frequency of 
cytochrome B mutants which leads to a high failure rate if atovaquone is used on its own to treat malaria.  Specific mutations (Y268S, Y268C) have been shown to confer resistance in vivo,456 but there are other mechanisms of resistance that remain unknown.7

The United States Department of Veterans Affairs Police is the uniformed 
police service of the 

United States Department of Veterans Affairs
, responsible for the protection of the 
VA hospitals and other facilities operated by 

United States Department of Veterans Affairs
 and the 





Veterans Health Administration




. 


The VA Police is a 
law enforcement agency with full authority to enforce laws and rules and regulations and make 
arrests on VA property. VA Police officers make arrests and transport offenders to and from county jails and federal courthouses under the direction of the 
United States Marshal Service. VA Police operate throughout the United States under the direction of individual facility directors. The VA Police occasionally provide 
Executive Protection services for the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs and comprise over 2800 appointed personnel.



History


The 
Veterans Administration was founded in 1930. The VA Protective Service was established that year and was charged with 
maintaining order, protecting persons and property, and ensuring 
fire safety. As the VA evolved, the fire safety role was turned over to the Engineering Service and the Protective Service became a security guard force (

OPM
 
GS 0085 series).


By a 1973 
federal law, the guard force was abolished and the VA Police (0083 series) was established.  The President and Congress made this decission due in part to the changing needs of the VA and an increase in police-related matters not ususally handled by a guard force or community law enforcement agencies.




Line-of-duty deaths


Seven officers of the VA Police have died in the line of duty:1



Marvin C. Bland, age 34, was killed in an 
automobile accident on September 6, 1985, while responding to a fire alarm at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in 

Bedford, Massachusetts
.


Mark S. Decker, age 31, and Leonard B. Wilcox, age 37, were shot and killed on January 31, 1986, while attempting to question a suspicious man at the Brecksville VA Hospital in 

Brecksville, Ohio
. Both Decker and Wilcox were  armed only with mace due to administrative guidelines. While the officers were talking with the man he pulled out a .45 caliber handgun and shot Officer Decker, killing him instantly. Officer Wilcox attempted to run for cover, but the suspect chased him before shooting him as well.  The killer was sentenced to two 
life terms for the 
murders.


Ronald Hearn, age 49, was shot and killed on July 25, 1988 at the Bronx VA Hospital in 

New York City
. The alarm was set off when a man walked through the 
metal detector; when Hearn approached the man, he pulled out a gun and shot Hearn, who was wearing a 






vest





 but was shot between the two panels. At the time of Hearn's death VA Police were not supplied vests. 


Garry A. Ross, age 41, died from a 
heart attack on December 24, 1990 at the VA Medical Center in 

Washington, D.C.
. Ross died after responding to a call of a mentally deranged patient, who assaulted him several times. Ross suffered a massive heart attack after he restrained the patient.


Horst Harold Woods, age 46, was shot and killed on January 10, 1996, in 

Albuquerque, New Mexico
. Woods had approached a man kneeling beside his 
patrol car; when Woods approached him from the opposite side of the car, the man stood up, exchanged words with Woods, and then shot him in the back of his head as Woods turned away. The man was arrested later the same day. The suspect was arrested a short time later by 








Air Force Security Forces







 at 

Kirtland Air Force Base
, where he was found with  two extra fully loaded 




clips



, an 18-inch 
bowie knife and a long-
barreled 
Derringer loaded with two 
shotgun 
shells. 


Jose Oscar Rodriguez-Reyes, age 53, was shot and killed on April 24, 2002 while stationed at a gate at the VA Medical Center in 

San Juan, Puerto Rico
. Rodriguez-Reyes was attacked by two men for unknown reasons and shot in the head and chest. The two attempted to steal Rodriguez-Reyes' service weapon but were unable to remove it from the 
holster. Rodriguez-Reyes was the first armed VA Police officer to be killed in the line of duty. Two suspects were arrested by the 


FBI

. Charged with 
murder, the suspect who shot Rodriguez-Reyes was convicted in July 2006.






Personnel


The majority of VA Police applicants must either have a minimum of two years of experience in law enforcement with 
arrest authority (in 
federal, 
state, municipal, or 
military police), or have a 
bachelor's degree in 
criminal justice.  Applicants must also undergo a 
physical examination, 
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) 
psychological evaluation and 
background investigation.


Upon selection, VA Police Officers go through a basic five-week training course at the VA Law Enforcement Training Center (LETC) in 

Little Rock, Arkansas
 to supplement training most have already received in previous occupations. Additionally, VA Police Officers receive continuous in-service and specialized training. 


VA Police Officers are certified in 
CPR (as 
first responders), use of 
pepper spray, the PR-24 





police baton




, and the 

Beretta 92D
 

9 mm
 firearm.


Like the 

Pentagon Force Protection Agency
, the VA Police are not members of the 
Law Enforcement Retirement System (LERS), and do not enjoy the same retirement benefits as most other federal law enforcement officers. Legislation has been proposed to change this (HR 1002), but the last effort failed to make it out of committee in the 





109th Congress




. The legislation is expected to be reintroduced in the 110th Congress.

School fires







Lake View School, Collinwood, Ohio as it appeared before March 4, 1908.



The Collinwood School Fire (also known as the Lake View School Fire) of 

Ash Wednesday
, 
March 4, 
1908 was one of the deadliest disasters of its type in the 








United States







 during its era. 172 students, two teachers and a rescuer were killed in the disaster in 





Collinwood




, 





Ohio




, a community that has since been absorbed into the city of 

Cleveland
.

While the Lake View School was built with load bearing masonry outer walls, much of the four story building s floor structure system used wooden joists.  It was one wooden joist that caught fire when it was overheated by a steam pipe.  The building s main stair case extended from the front doors of the building, up to the third floor; without benefit of fire doors, the stairwell acted like a chimney, helping to spread the fire quickly.  Oiled wooden hall and classroom floors also fueled the fire.


A common misconception about the building's design is that the doors opened inward. They did not, as has been verified in accounts of the fire written at the time.  Doors to the building were equipped with common door knob latches, not the more modern 
crash bar type latch. As panic leading to the crush of a large number of students in stairwell vestibules contributed to the death toll, students also died as a result of smoke inhalation and the fire itself. Some children died jumping from second and third story windows.  Community members watched as victims trapped in the building were burned beyond recognition.





Lake View School, Collinwood, Ohio the morning following the fire of March 4, 1908. 175 people lost their lives in the fire, making it the greatest loss of life in a fire of this type in a school in the United States to that date.






Aftermath


Those killed in the fire who could not be identified, as well as those students whose parents could not afford a burial, were buried in a mass grave in Cleveland's 
Lakeview Cemetery.  Additionally, several families who lost their children in the fire chose to bury their children s remains adjacent to the Collinwood victims.


Following the fire, the remains of the Lake View School were demolished and a memorial garden planned for the site.  A new school, Collinwood Memorial Elementary School (razed in 2004) was built adjacent to the disaster site, and incorporated many features that had been lacking in the previous building.  Unlike the building involved in the disaster, the new school incorporated fire safe stairwells, a central alarm system, and was built of steel framing and other fire safe materials. Although the new school was torn down in 2004, a memorial plaque remains on the site as new development is added to the area.     


The disaster also led to a national effort to change doors at public buildings so that they opened outward, and made  panic bar  latches on doors required in all schools. The final casualty of the fire was the independence of the Collinwood community itself.  Unable to sufficiently guarantee fire safety resources for its residents, voters approved an annexation of Collinwood into Cleveland within two years of the fire.

State Trunk Highway 100 (STH 100, commonly known as Highway 100 or WIS 100) is a road which encircles the outer edges of 

Milwaukee County
. Officially, the road is designed as a 
bypass around the city of 

Milwaukee
, but with residential and commercial development along Highway 100 on almost all portions of the road, this purpose has been negated, and it serves as one of the Milwaukee area's major commercial corridors. Highway 100 roughly parallels the freight railroad beltway around Milwaukee constructed in 1912 by the 
Chicago and Northwestern Railroad, approximately one mile inside the north, west and south county lines.

In Milwaukee's immediate western suburb 

Wauwatosa
, Highway 100's north-south segment was once known as Lovers Lane; parts of the road still have this designation.  In the vicinity of 

Mayfair Shopping Center
, it is known as Mayfair Road; this corresponds to 107th street in Milwaukee's numbered roadways scheme.


The roadway served the 





Muirdale Tuberculosis Sanatorium




 and County Airfield and Limestone Quarry at what is now Currie Park. In the late 1950s, due to the combination of ready roadway and rail access, the area experienced an employment boom as several large cold storage warehouses and food-related truck terminals were constructed nearby. With the development of the Mayfair Shopping Center in 1958 by malting scion 
Kurtis Froedtert, the name was changed to Mayfair Road. One of the few vestiges of this earlier era is the roadway's popularity as a  
cruising strip  for exhibition motorists.  


Inexpensive land and burgeoning growth in western Milwaukee County and the adjacent 
Waukesha County have served to create a new 
edge city commercial center centered on this busy arterial. Mayfair Shopping Center remains a key component of this area. With the privitization and redevelopment of the County Grounds including Muirdale and the expansion of 





Froedtert Hospital




 and the 







Medical College of Wisconsin






 there will be increasing pressure to develop the last large parcels of adjacent privately-owned open space in the area; and there will likely be additional traffic pressures placed on this onetime Lovers Lane.

Gjon Mili (born 1904, 
Korca, 

Albania
   1984) was an 
Albanian-American 
photographer.


Biography


Born to Vasil Mili and his mother Viktori Cekani, came to the 








United States







 in 1923. Fifteen years later he was photographing for 










LIFE magazine









 (a relationship that continued until his death in 1984), and his assignments took him to the Riviera (
Picasso); to Prades, France (



Pablo Casals


 in exile); to Israel (

Adolf Eichmann
 in captivity); to Florence, Athens, Dublin, Berlin, Venice, 


Rome

, and Hollywood to photograph celebrities and artists, sports events, and concerts, and. sculptures and architecture.


Working with 

Harold Eugene Edgerton
 of 
MIT, Gjon Mili was a pioneer since the 1930s in the use of photoflash to capture a sequence of actions in one photograph.
Trained as an engineer and self-taught in photography, Gjon Mili was the first to use electronic flash and stroboscopic light to create photographs that had more than scientific interest. Since the late 1930s, his pictures of dance, athletics, and musical and theatrical performances have astonished and delighted millions of viewers, revealing the beautiful intricacy and graceful flow of movement too rapid or too complex for the eye to discern. His portraits of artists, musicians, and other notables are less visually spectacular, but equally masterful.


In 1944, he directed the short film Jammin' the blues,12 which was made at Warner Bros., and featured performances by Lester Young, Red Callendar, Harry Edison,  Big  Sid Catlett, Illinois Jacquet, Barney Kessel, Jo Jones and Marie Bryant.  Mili did not serve as cinematographer for the film (that job was performed by Robert Burks) but the film used multiplied images that in many ways recall the multi-image still-frames done with the strobe.  The imaginative use of the camera makes this film a minor landmark in the way musicians are filmed.


In 1939, Mili became a freelance photographer working for LIFE. In the course of more than four decades, literally thousands of his pictures were published by LIFE as well as other publications. In the mid-1940s he was an assistant to the photographer 


Edward Weston

. He died in 

Stamford, Connecticut
, in 1984.


Gjon Mili is the one photographer who has formed our contemporary visual understanding of movement, both in the direct example of his pictures and in the influence his work has had on all action photographers who have come after him.


His book  Photographs and Recollections  is a summary of his fifty years of work in photography.3

Battery chargers
Battery electric vehicle components
Energy conversion







 This unit charges the batteries until they reach a specific voltage and then it trickle charges the batteries until it is disconnected.






A simple charger equivalent to a AC-DC wall adapter. It applies 300mA to the battery at all times, which will damage the battery if left connected too long.



A battery charger is a device used to put energy into a secondary cell or 
(rechargeable) 
battery by forcing an 
electric current through it.

The charge 
current depends upon the technology and capacity of the battery being charged. For example, the current that should be applied to recharge a 12 
V 
car battery will be very different from the current for a 
mobile phone battery.



Types of battery chargers



Simple


A simple charger works by connecting a constant 
DC 
power source to the battery being charged. The simple charger does not alter its output based on time or the charge on the battery. This simplicity means that a simple charger is inexpensive, but there is a tradeoff in quality. Typically, a simple charger takes longer to charge a battery to prevent severe over-charging. Even so, a battery left in a simple charger for too long will be weakened or destroyed due to over-charging. These chargers can supply either a 
constant voltage or a 
constant current to the battery.




Trickle





Main article: 
trickle charging

A trickle charger is a kind of simple charger that charges the battery slowly, at the self-discharge rate.
A trickle charger is the slowest kind of battery charger.
A battery can be left in a trickle charger indefinitely.
Leaving a battery in a trickle charger keeps the battery  topped up  but never over-charges.




Timer-based


The output of a 
timer charger is terminated after a pre-determined time. Timer chargers were the most common type for high-capacity 
Ni-Cd cells in the late 1990s for example (low-capacity consumer Ni-Cd cells were typically charged with a simple charger).


Often a timer charger and set of batteries could be bought as a bundle and the charger time was set to suit those batteries. If batteries of lower capacity were charged then they would be overcharged, and if batteries of higher capacity were charged they would be only partly charged. With the trend for battery technology to increase capacity year on year, an old timer charger would only partly charge the newer batteries.


Timer based chargers also had the drawback that charging batteries that were not fully discharged, even if those batteries were of the correct capacity for the particular timed charger, would result in over-charging.




Intelligent


Output current depends upon the battery's state. An intelligent charger may monitor the battery's voltage, temperature and/or time under charge to determine the optimum charge current at that instant. Charging is terminated when a combination of the voltage, temperature and/or time indicates that the battery is fully charged.


For Ni-Cd and 
NiMH batteries, the voltage across the battery increases slowly during the charging process, until the battery is fully charged. After that, the voltage decreases, which indicates to an intelligent charger that the battery is fully charged. Such chargers are often labeled as a  V, or  delta-V,  charger, indicating that they monitor the voltage change.


However, the magnitude of  delta-V  can become small or even nonexistant if (very) high capacity rechargable batteries are recharged. This can cause even an intelligent battey charger to not sense that the batteries are actually already fully charged, and continue charging. Overcharging of the batteries result. 


A typical intelligent charger fast-charges a battery up to about 85% of its maximum capacity in less than an hour, then switches to trickle charging, which takes several hours to top off the battery to its full capacity.
1




Fast


Fast chargers make use of control circuitry in the batteries being charged to rapidly charge the batteries without damaging the cells' elements. Most such chargers have a 
cooling fan to help keep the temperature of the cells under control. Most are also capable of acting as a standard overnight charger if used with standard NiMH cells that do not have the special control circuitry. Some fast chargers, such as those made by Energizer, can fast-charge any NiMH battery even if it does not have the control circuit.




 Pulse 


Some chargers use pulse technology in which a pulse is fed to the 
battery. This DC pulse has a strictly controlled 
rise time, pulse width, pulse repetition rate (
frequency) and 
amplitude. This technology is said to work with any size, voltage, capacity or chemistry of batteries, including automotive and 




 valve-regulated



 batteries.23
With pulse charging, high instantaneous voltages can be applied without overheating the battery.  In a 
Lead-acid battery, this breaks-down stubborn lead-sulfate crystals, thus greatly extending the battery service life.4


Several kinds of pulse charging are patented.567  Others are 
open source hardware.8


Some chargers use pulses to check the current battery state when the charger is first connected, then use constant current charging during fast charging, then use pulse charging as a kind of trickle charging to maintain the charge.9


Some chargers use  negative pulse charging , also called  reflex charging  or  burp charging .10
Such chargers use both positive and brief negative current pulses.
Such chargers don't work any better than pulse chargers that only use positive pulses.1112




Inductive





Main article: 
Inductive charging

Inductive battery chargers use 
electromagnetic induction to charge batteries.  A charging station sends electromagnetic energy through 
inductive coupling to an electrical device, which stores the energy in the batteries.  This is achieved without the need for metal contacts between the charger and the battery.  It is commonly used in 
electric toothbrushes and other devices used in bathrooms. Because there are no open electrical contacts, there is no risk of electrocution.




USB-based

 



Pay-per-charge 
kiosk, illustrating the variety of mobile phone charger connectors.


Since the 

Universal Serial Bus
 specification provides for a five-volt power supply, it's possible to use a USB 
cable as a power source for recharging batteries. Products based on this approach include chargers designed to charge standard 
NiMH cells13, and custom NiMH batteries with built-in USB plugs and circuitry which eliminate the need for a separate charger.14 

Moixa
 Energy patented a design of batteries, branded 
USBCELL, that incorporate their own USB chargers internally, complete with their own plugs. In the currently available AA battery design, the positive end of the battery doubles as a flip-cap for the built-in USB plug.15







Charge rate


This is often denoted as C and signifies a charge or discharge rate equal to the capacity of a battery divided by 1 hour. For example C for a 1600 mAh battery would be 1600 mA (or 1.6 amps). 2C is twice this rate and 1/2C is half the rate.




Applications


Since a battery charger is intended to be connected to a battery, it may not have voltage regulation or filtering of the DC voltage output. Battery chargers equipped with both voltage regulation and filtering may be identified as 
battery eliminators. 



Mobile phone charger


Most mobile phone chargers are not really chargers, only 
adapters that provide a power source for the charging circuitry which is almost always contained within the mobile phone.16 Mobile phones can usually accept relatively wide range of voltages, as long as it is sufficiently above the phone battery's voltage. However, if the voltage is too high, it can damage the phone. Mostly, the voltage is 5 volts or slightly higher, but it can sometimes vary up to 12 volts when the power source is not loaded.


Battery chargers for 
mobile phones and other devices are notable in that they come in a wide variety of 



DC connector


-styles and voltages, most of which are not compatible with other manufactuers' phones or even different models of phones from a single manufacturer.


Users of publicly accessible charging kiosks must be able to cross-reference connectors with device brands/models and individual charge parameters and thus ensure delivery of the correct charge for their mobile device. A database-driven system is one solution, and is being incorporated into some of the latest designs of charging kiosks. 





The Ionhub charger 17 can simultaneously charge several electronic devices: 
iPod Nano, 
Razr, 

Nintendo DS Lite
, 
BlackBerry, portable 
DVD player, and 
electric shaver.





There are also human-powered chargers sold on the market, which typically consists of a 
dynamo powered by a hand 
crank and extension cords. There are also 
solar chargers.18


China and other countries are making a national standard on mobile phone chargers using the 
USB standard.19




 Battery charger for vehicles





Further information: 
Charging station


There are two main types of charges for vehicles: 





 To recharge a fuel vehicle's starter battery, where a modular charger is used.


 To recharge an electric vehicle (EV) battery pack.






 Battery electric vehicle 


These vehicles include a 
battery pack, so generally use series charger. 


A 10 Ampere-hour battery could take 15 hours to reach a fully charged state from a fully discharged condition with a 1 Ampere charger as it would require roughly 1.5 times the battery's capacity.


Public EV charging 20 heads (aka: stations) provide 6kW (host power of 208 to 240 VAC off a 40 amp circuit). 6kW will recharge an EV roughly 6 times faster than 1kW overnight charging. 


Rapid charging results in even faster recharge times and is only limited by available AC power and the type of charging system 21. 


On board EV chargers (change AC power to DC power to recharge the EV's pack) can be: 



 Isolated: they make no physical connection between the 
A/C electrical 
mains and the batteries being charged. These typically employ some form of 
Inductive charging. Some isolated chargers may be used in parallel. This allows for an increased charge current and reduced charging times. 







 Non-isolated: the battery charger has a direct electrical connection the A/C outlet's wiring. Non-isolated chargers cannot be using in parallel. 





Power Factor Correction (PFC) chargers can more closely approach the maximum current the plug can deliver, shortening charging time.


Some battery electric vehicle charging devices includes: 




Manzanita Micro Power factor correction (PFC) PFC series chargers (mid price range) (non-isolated) (90 to 240 VAC input, 12 to 366 VDC output). 


Russco 22 SC and DSO series chargers (low price range) (non-isolated) (120 VAC input, 72 to 120 VDC battery packs, 120 to 156 VDC pack require their AC input boost transformer).



Zivan 23 NG series chargers (mid price range) (isolated).



BRUSA Elektronik AG (high price range) (isolated).

leases and credits.







Prolonging battery life



A 
short circuit (connecting the output terminals together) does not usually damage a simple battery charger. For that reason it is a suitable source of DC voltage for experimentation. It may, however, require an external 
capacitor to be connected across its output terminals in order to  smooth  the voltage sufficiently, which may be thought of as a DC voltage plus a  
ripple  voltage added to it. To see the difference between connecting and not connecting a capacitor, connect also an 
oscilloscope across the output terminals.
Note that there may be an 
internal resistance connected to limit the short circuit current, and the value of that internal resistance may have to be taken into consideration in experiments.


On the other hand, many rumors circulate about the best practices to prolong battery life.  What practices are best depend on the type of battery. It is  rumored  that Nickel-based cells, such as NiMH and NiCd, need to be fully discharged before each charge, or else the battery loses capacity over time in a phenomenon known as  
memory effect . However, this is only partially accurate: nickel alloy cells can be charged at any point throughout their discharge cycle    they do not have to be fully discharged. 
Memory effect should instead be prevented by fully discharging the battery once a month (once every 30 charges)25. This extends the life of the battery since 
memory effect is prevented while avoiding full charge cycles which are known to be hard on all types of dry-cell batteries, eventually resulting in a permanent decrease in battery capacity.


Most modern cell phones, laptops, and most electric vehicles use 
Lithium-ion batteries.  Contrary to some recommendations, these batteries actually last longest if the battery is not fully charged; fully charging and discharging them will degrade their capacity relatively quickly. Degradation occurs faster at higher temperatures. Lithium batteries degrade more while fully charged than if it is only 40% charged. The conditions of high temperature combined with full charge are exactly the scenario occurring when a 
laptop computer is run on AC power.  Degradation in 
lithium-ion batteries is caused by an increased internal battery resistance due to cell 
oxidation. This decreases the efficiency of the battery, resulting in less net current available to be drawn from the battery.


Internal combustion engine vehicles, such as boats, RVs, ATVs, motorcycles, cars, trucks, and more use 
lead acid batteries. These batteries employ a 
sulfuric acid 
electrolyte and can generally be charged and discharged without exhibiting 
memory effect, though 
sulfation (a chemical reaction in the battery which deposits a layer of sulfates on the lead) will occur over time. Keeping the electrolyte level in the recommended range is necessary. When discharged, these batteries should be recharged immediately in order to prevent 
sulfation. These sulfates are electrically insulating and therefore interfere with the transfer of charge from the sulfuric acid to the lead, resulting in a lower maximum current than can be drawn from the battery. Sulfated lead acid batteries typically need replacing. Good ventilation and avoidance of ignition sources (e.g., sparks) is wise when recharging, since charging a lead acid battery generates highly explosive 
hydrogen gas.

Vasco da Gama





South Goa







Vasco da Gama (

Konkani
/
Marathi :       ) (often shortened to Vasco) is a small city in 

Goa
 state on the west coast of 

India
. It is named after the 

Portuguese
 explorer 

Vasco da Gama
. Vasco has Goa's largest population, estimated at over 100,000. It is also the headquarters of the 








Mormugao







 
taluka. The town lies on the western tip of the 








Mormugao







 peninsula, at the mouth of the 
Zuari River, about 30 km from 








Panaji







 (Panjim), Goa's capital, and about 5 km from the Dabolim Airport (GOI).

The place was founded in 
1543, and remained in Portuguese hands until 
1961, when Goa was annexed to India. The Indian Navy's 
Goa Naval Area (base) is located at Vasco from which it controls 
Dabolim airport and, in effect, the entire tourism-dependent state of Goa.


Vasco  city  is well connected by road, rail, sea and air;
By road by the NH 17A (National Highway), by rail by the 




South Western Railway



, by the sea through the 
Mormugoa Harbour and by air by the 

Dabolim Airport
, thus serving as the main hub for foreign Tourists.





Breakwater at Mormugao Harbour






Manganese ore mined in interior regions is brought to Marmugoa by barges navigating the rivers 
Mandovi and Zuari, and then either collected in the Mormugao Port to be loaded onto bulk carrier ships or directly loaded onto the ships using 
trans-shippers.
Ore which is collected on the port is handled by state-of-the-art machinery called MOHP (Mechanical Ore Handling Plant). This includes massive bucket wheel loaders and miles of conveyor belts. The port has berthing facilities for large cruise liners as well as a floating dry dock.






Map of Goa






Harbour of Vasco






Tourism








Bogmalo Beach




 is 9 km from Vasco. This beach is quite risky as it has underwater currents and is therefore usually monitored by lifeguards. Khollant and Baina are two smaller beaches around Vasco.


The people from Vasco love fun and music, so it is a matter of fact that Goa's premier musical group, Diamond Orchestra, hails from Vasco. The town is also home to several English bands from Goa namely, Lynx, Heaven's Touch, and Kollectiv Soul. Vasco is also famous as the abode of Goa's toddy tappers,  Vialli (locally known as Render), holds the world record for staying in a coconut tree for almost two years. []

People from San Francisco, California
People from San Jose, California
House musicians
Club DJs





Julius Papp is a 
house music producer and 
DJ whose roots lie in 
Disco of the '70s and 

New Wave
 of the '80s. 


Julius was born and raised in 

Montreal
, 

Canada
, and got tuned into 
dance music through the city s flourishing club scene and diverse radio broadcasts. He started collecting 
vinyl records in the late '70s and took to the turntables in 1985, scoring his first major club gig 2 years later.


He moved to 
Los Angeles in 1981 and then again three years later, up north, to 

San Jose
 where the 



Bay Area


 has been his home and finally settling into 
San Francisco.


Early DJ influences for Julius came from reading about specific parties that were piloted by talented music programmers that even today, still influence the youngest of aspiring DJ s. Legends like 


Larry Levan

 at the 






Paradise Garage





 in 
NYC to 

Frankie Knuckles
 at The Warehouse in 

Chicago
 to 
Tony Humphries  weekly at 

Zanzibar
 in 

New Jersey
. Always inspired by any track listing in those articles, Julius would hunt down the music that became classics, worshiped by their discerning audiences. To this day, his goal is to keep solidifying his music foundation by being open minded and eclectic in absorbing the music that truly touches him.


That open minded attitude has also groomed Julius into fine tuning his musical palette by giving him a dominant sound which exudes a deep and soulful perspective, which he translates onto the dancefloor. That being said, he blends various styles together (including 
Latin, Afro, Disco, 
Jazz) with such fluidity that it is difficult at times to put a defining stamp on his sound. Contributing to that is his willingness to take a chance. He always tries to push the envelope by introducing music that may or may not go over well, but feels deserves the exposure. He takes his audience on a musical journey with various mood and energy changes.


Not content to limiting his ambitions on the dancefloor, Julius began producing music in 1994. The studio was another outlet for Julius  creative ideas to flow. His early releases were on the downtempo 
Acid Jazz tip.


He drew attention as part of the jazz and 
funk scene in San Francisco via the 




Mushroom Jazz



 parties alongside resident 






Mark Farina





.


As Julius  production catalog grew, so did the amount of labels he released music on including   Nervous (NYC), Maxi (NYC), Large (Chicago), Yellow (Paris), King ST (NYC), Loveslap (SF) and OM (SF).


A veteran DJ and Producer, Julius has refined a style of dance music that has taken him beyond the boundaries of San Francisco to global praise and recognition. Being nominated as  Most Innovative Producer  at the 2004 House Music Awards is a perfect example of that. Putting him in the company of 









Joey Negro








, 






Osunlade





, 
DJ Gregory, 


DJ Spinna

 and 













Ben Watt












 was an absolute honor for him.


Along with working wizardry in the studio, Julius has become a familiar face behind the decks, which has taken him around the world. He has DJ d at popular mainstays like  
Pacha  in 

Ibiza
 and  

Ministry of Sound
  in 

London
, To 





Zouk




 in 

Singapore
.


Currently, Julius has two residencies in San Francisco. A Thursday night event at 
Pink called  Simple  - a party where Julius  innovative talents are more prevalent as his diverse and eclectic style creates a repertoire that subtly changes from week to week. The other, a collaboration with 









Miguel Migs








 which takes place at 
Mighty every Saturday night called  Salted Saturdays  and features other local and international DJ s.


In 2003, Julius Papp ventured into the label arena with NeoDisco Music. Named after the sound that continues to inspire Julius, the label offers him an alternate outlet to release his own productions without feeling pressured into producing formulaic music that might become predictable.


Julius  latest CD compilation mix is on 
Loveslap entitled Heartbeat Vol. 2.

People from the Rhine Province
1985 deaths




Helmut Thielicke (
December 4 
1908 in 

Wuppertal
   
March 5 
1986 in 














Hamburg













) was a 

German
 
theologian and 
rector of the 

University of Hamburg
 from 1960 to 1978.


Biography



Thielicke grew up in Wuppertal, where he went to a humanistic 





Gymnasium




 and took his 










Abitur









 in 1928. After this he began to study 
philosophy and 
theology in 

Erlangen
, but soon had to undergo an operation on his 
thyroid. Despite the negative outcome of this operation (
pulmonary embolism, 
tetanus), which were still causing complications 4 years later, he finished his studies and in 1932 he got his doctorate in philosophy with  Das Verhaltnis zwischen dem Ethischen und dem Astethischen  (The relationship between the ethical and the aesthetic). 


After his health improved, Thielicke listened to 

Karl Barth
 in 

Bonn
, whom he criticized, mainly because of Barth's exclusion of natural 
anthropology. Eventually he did his doctor's degree in theology in 1934 with a work under the supervision of 
Paul Althaus in Erlangen. He took his postdoctoral lecture qualification with  Offenbarung, Vernunft und Existenz. Studien zur Religionsphilosophie Lessings  (Revelation, reason and existence; studies in Lessing's religious philosophy) in 1935 under the growing pressure of the 
Nazi-Regime, which refused him an appointment to Erlangen in view of his activity within the  








Confessing Church







 . In 1936 he obtained a professorship in 
systematic theology in 

Heidelberg
, where he met Marie-Luise Herrmann, to whom he was married in 1937. They had four children.


After repeated interrogations by the 


Gestapo

 from the mid-1930s onwards, he was finally dismissed in 1940. Thielicke was conscripted, but nine months later he was able to take over a church in 



Regensburg


 with the help of regional bishop 
Wurm. In 1942 he assumed theological office in 

Stuttgart
, from where he delivered numerous sermons and went on lecture tours, continually made difficult by the government by means of bans on travel, publication and preaching. Thielicke published a critique of 
Bultmann's composition about the 
demythologisation of the New Testament, which gave rise to a respectful, but inconclusive correspondence between the two. He also contacted the resistance group 
Freiburger Kreis, but without working actively in their plans for a revolution.


The bombing of Stuttgart in 1944 forced Thielicke and his family to go to 
Korntal, where he continued his lecture tours and preaching services in the following years; these were anonymously translated into many languages in Switzerland and read on various fronts of the war. Immediately after the end of the war Thielicke travelled with a group of delegates to 
Frankfurt, where he got involved in talks with the military government about the re-establishment of a faculty and the resumption of academic work in the political and academic vacuum of the postwar period. He took over a professorship at the reopened theological faculty in Tubingen in 1947 and in 1951 was made head of the university and president of the chancellors' conference. In 1954 he was called to 














Hamburg













 to found a new theological faculty, where he acted as a dean and professor, and was also preacher in the main church of Hamburg, 
St. Michaelis.


He got to know 


Billy Graham

 during lecture tours in the 
USA and was received by 







Jimmy Carter






 in 1977. Thielicke travelled to Asia, South Africa, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand in the 1960s and 1970s.


Thielicke died 1986 in Hamburg, aged 77. The 
Thielickestieg behind the  Hamburger Michel  was named after him.

The Art Workers Guild is an organization established in 1884 by a group of young architects associated with the ideas of 


William Morris

 and the 
Arts and Crafts movement. The guild promoted the 'unity of all the arts', denying the distinction between fine and applied art. It opposed the professionalization of architecture   which was promoted by the 




Royal Institute of British Architects



 at this time   in the belief that this would inhibit design. Its first master was the sculptor, 

George Blackall Simonds
.

 since 2002. News World Communications is owned by the church and owns 

The Washington Times
, 
United Press International,  and numerous other publications, including the 






Middle East Times





, and Tiempos del Mundo, a Spanish-language newspaper published in 16 countries throughout the Americas.123He is also the president of the Family Party for the Universal Peace and Unity, a 

South Korean
 political party founded by the Unification Church, one of whose main goals is the 
reunification of Korea.4 He was formerly the President of the Unification Church related organization the 
Family Federation for World Peace and Unification and has been described as Sun Myung Moon's assistant and chief advisor. His daughter, Jun Sook Kwak, is married to Moon's son,

Islamic terrorism and United States support for the 
United Nations.7

Sun Myung Moon coronation













In a ceremony held March 23, 2004 in a United States federal office building in Washington D. C., a bejeweled crown was placed on the head of Sun Myung Moon, who gave a speech saying he was  humanity's Savior, Messiah, Returning Lord and True Parent. 8 Kwak took the stage and proclaimed Moon and his wife  the King and Queen of the second and third Israel  (respectively: Christiandom, and the new worldwide Kingdom of God centered on the Unification Church).9 Kwak explained later that its significance was that  in effect, the crowning means America is saying to Father, 'Please become my king,' 10

Tension of the Times 
Washington Post June 18, 2004,  Sources say that the dominant church official overseeing the publications is now the Rev. Chung Hwan Kwak, a close adviser to the church's founder, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. 

Washington Post,  Insiders say the church's new line is that with the end of the Cold War, it's important to support international organizations such as the United Nations and to campaign for world peace and interfaith understanding. ...He said at a conference in 2002 that the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks  showed the tensions that exist between much of the Islamic world and the United States. To understand the conflict in the world today, we must understand the role of religion.  Many hawkish Times columnists would probably dissent.

Frank Duveneck

October 9, 1848(1848-10-09)








Elizabeth Otis Lyman Boott(1846-1888)



Frank Duveneck (
October 9, 
1848   
January 3, 
1919) was an 








American







 figure and portrait painter.


Duveneck was born in 

Covington, Kentucky
, the son of a German immigrant Bernard Decker. Decker died when Frank was only a year old and his widow remarried Joseph Duveneck. By the age of fifteen Frank had begun the study of art under the tutelage of a local painter, Johann Schmitt and had been apprenticed to a German firm of church decorators.1 While having grown up in Covington, Duveneck was a part of the German community in 

Cincinnati, Ohio
. However, due to his 


Catholic

 beliefs and German heritage, he was an outsider as far as the artistic community of Cincinnati was concerned.2 In 1869 he went abroad to study with Wilhelm von Diez and 






Wilhelm Leibl





 at the Royal Academy of 
Munich, where he learned a dark, realistic and direct style of painting. He subsequently became one of the young American painters   others were 






William Merritt Chase





, 






John Henry Twachtman





, and 






Walter Shirlaw





   who in the 1870s overturned the traditions of the 





Hudson River School




 and started a new art movement characterized by a greater freedom of paint application. 





Portrait of Maggie Wilson, Oil on board, 38.10 x 30.48 cm, 

Museum of Fine Arts, Houston
, Texas, USA





His work, at first ignored, when shown in 
Boston and elsewhere about 1875, attracted great attention, and many pupils flocked to him in 

Germany
 and 



Italy


, where he made long visits. 



Henry James


 called him  the unsuspected genius  and at the age of 27 he was a celebrated artist. In 1878 Duveneck opened a school in Munich, and in the village of Polling in 





Bavaria




. His students, known as the  Duveneck Boys , included Twachtman, 
Otto Bacher, 






Julius Rolshoven





, and 
Herman Wessel.3 In 1886 he married one of his students who was much admired by 



Henry James


, Boston-born Elizabeth Boott. They lived in 








Bellosguardo







 for two years where she produced a son. She died later in Paris of pneumonia. Duveneck was devastated. After returning from Italy to America, he gave some attention to 
sculpture, and modelled a fine monument to his wife, now in the 

English
 cemetery in 

Florence
. Despite this activity, Elizabeth's death marked a slowing in his productivity - a wealthy man, he chose to lead a life of relative obscurity. He lived in Covington until his death in 1919 and taught at the 

Art Academy of Cincinnati
, where some pupils of note were 






Edward Charles Volkert





 and 

Russel Wright
. 


In later years, he often spent summers in 

Gloucester, Massachusetts
.2  


Among his most famous paintings are Lady with Fan (1873) and The Whistling Boy (1872), both of which reveal Duveneck's debt to the dark palette and slashing brushwork of 

Frans Hals
. His work can be seen at the 

Metropolitan Museum of Art
 in New York City, the 

National Gallery of Art
 in Washington, DC, the 

Cincinnati Art Museum
, the 




Richmond Art Museum



 and the 
Kenton County Library in Covington, Ky.


Duveneck is buried at Old Mother of God Cemetery, Madison Avenue and 26th Street, Covington, Kenton County.4

 All Because of You  is a song by 


U2

 which first appeared on their 
2004 album, 

How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb
. 


History


This was the second single from the album in 



North America


. The song was released for airplay in the 








United States







 concurrently with the album release date (the first single,  

Vertigo
 , had been released prior to the album debut).




Chart success


The song debuted at twenty-seven on the 
Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and went on to reach six. It entered at thirty-nine on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart three weeks after its release and reached twenty. However, the single's airplay quickly diminished. The song achieved significantly less success than the second American single released from 


U2's

 previous two albums, both of which spent several months on the Hot 100.


 All Because of You  was released in the 











United Kingdom










 on 
10 October 
2005. It was added to 

Xfm London
's 
playlist and 

BBC Radio 1
's C-list, later moving to the B-list. The song finally made it to the A-list on 
28 September. The song also made it onto 

BBC Radio 2
's B-list. The song jumped to ten on the airplay chart on 
10 October, after lingering around fifty for a month.  All Because of You  entered the singles chart at four, but slipped out of the 
top 40 just two weeks later. It also failed to chart in the 











U.K.










 download chart.




Vertigo tour


 All Because of You  has been regularly performed on the 

Vertigo Tour
, though it has missed a number of shows. It has typically opened the second encore. 



Bono


 has introduced it live as  a love song to 


The Who

 , acknowledging The Who's obvious influence on the song's sound. He also played the tambourine during the live performance of the song.




Music video


The popular 
music video for this song was filmed in 

New York City
. U2 was aboard a flat bed truck riding around 

Manhattan
, playing the song. This was a huge and pleasant surprise to many New Yorkers who had no idea that U2 would be filming this video. U2's journey through New York took them across the 

Brooklyn Bridge
 to 

Brooklyn
, where they would perform a surprise mini-concert. This reached the top spot in Canada, even though it only sold 85 physical records, breaking the record for the lowest-selling Number 1 single ever in the 
Guinness World Book of Records.

cable internet and 
VOIP service in the towns of 

Aurora
 and 









Oak Ridges, Ontario








.


The company uses 
Docsis ver. 2.0 systems.

In early 2008, Rogers received CRTC approval to overbuild portions of Aurora Cable's service area, a move that Aurora had opposed.1 Shortly thereafter, Rogers announced an agreement to purchase Aurora, pending 
CRTC approval. 2


The purchase agreement was finalized and approved on June 12, 2008 and Aurora Cable Internet became part of Rogers Cable services.

Justin Williams (born 
October 4, 
1981 in 
Cobourg, 

Ontario
) is a 

Canadian
 professional 
ice hockey 
right winger who currently plays for the 



Carolina Hurricanes


 of the 

NHL
.



Playing career


Justin Williams played minor hockey in Port Hope, Ontario before gaining a reputation as a skilled playmaker with the Cobourg Cougars in 1998. He finished his Juniors hockey with two seasons played for the Plymouth Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League.


In four seasons played with the Philadelphia Flyers, Williams struggled to live up to expectations (even though he was adored by female fans everywhere), trying to adapt to the varying systems of three separate coaches, 

Craig Ramsay
 (2000), 

Bill Barber
 (2000 02), and 









Ken Hitchcock








 (2002 06). Williams was also frequently injured, perhaps hampering his development. He broke his left hand in his rookie season(hit by David Tanabe, Carolina Hurricanes), and had various sprains and strains in his sophomore year. Williams suffered a left knee injury on January 18, 2003, when he was hit low by Tampa Bay's 

Brad Lukowich
. The hit tore Williams's 

ACL
 and 
MCL, and on January 23, 2003, he had surgery to repair the ligaments. Originally projected to miss 4 8 months recovering from the injury, Williams  made it back into Philadelphia's lineup in just three months.


Williams was traded to Carolina on January 20, 2004, in exchange for defenceman Danny Markov. During the NHL Lockout in 2004 05, he went overseas to play for Lulea HF of the Swedish Elite League, where he posted 14 goals and 18 assists in 49 games.


Williams was signed to a one year deal with the Hurricanes for the 2005 06 season, when he set career highs in games played (82), goals(31), assists(45), points(76), and penalty minutes (60).   


Williams unintentionally injured popular Montreal Canadiens hockey star and team captain 

Saku Koivu
 in Game 3 of the 2006 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, for which he was villainized in some Canadian newspapers and by many Canadiens fans. Williams posted 7 goals and 11 assists on his way to winning the 









Stanley Cup








. Williams scored the final goal of the 





2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs




, an empty net goal at 18:59 of the third period, icing the win as the Hurricanes defeated the 
Edmonton Oilers 3 1 and won the series 4 3. 


On 
July 1, 2006, Williams signed a 5-year deal with the Hurricanes, worth $3,500,000 per season. 


On August 12th, 2006, Williams married his fiancee, Kelly. 


In 2006 07 Williams recorded career highs in goals(33), penalty minutes(73), power play goals(12), and game-winning goals(8). It was Williams' second consecutive season of 82 games played. Williams made his first appearance in an NHL All-Star game at the 2007 NHL All-Star game in Dallas, recording a goal and an assist. Williams also played for Team Canada in the World Championships, winning his second gold medal. 


Williams was off to a good start for his 2007 08 season, with 30 points in 36 games(9 goals, 21 assists), when his luck ran out and his season came to a screeching halt. On 
December 20, 2007, during the first period of a game with the Florida Panthers, Williams suffered a torn 

ACL
 and MCL in his left knee after a hit by Rostislav Olesz. Williams underwent successful surgery for the torn ligaments on December 26, 2007, and returned on April 1, 2008, only to leave the game with an unrelated back injury.


Justin and Kelly Williams celebrated the birth of their son, Jaxon, on July 3, 2008.


On September 17, 2008, Williams was sidelined for 4-6 months when he tore his right Achilles tendon in an off-ice, preseason workout. Williams underwent surgery for said injury on September 18, 2008. Williams will wear a full leg cast for 6-8 weeks.

Roy Williams at the 












National Scout jamboree in 2005











.



Roy Williams (born 1944) is the former 

Chief Scout Executive
 of the 
Boy Scouts of America.  He is the tenth person to hold that position, serving between 2000   2007.

Selected in the Spring of 2000 as Chief Scout Executive, Roy Williams began his career with the Boy Scouts of America as a district executive in 

Fort Worth, Texas
.  Following that, Williams served as district executive in 

Abilene, Texas
, finance director in 

Little Rock, Arkansas
, Scout executive for the Jayhawk Area Council in 

Topeka, Kansas
, and later the Narragansett Council in 

Providence, Rhode Island
. He has also served as director of the Boy Scout Division, BSA National Council and most recently, Western region director. 


Williams' term as Chief Scout Executive was a very challenging time for the Boy Scouts of America.  Shortly after Williams assumed the duties of Chief Scout Executive in 2000, the 

U.S. Supreme Court
 announced its ruling in the 

Boy Scouts of America v. Dale
 case, where the right of the Boy Scouts to exclude known and avowed homosexuals from its membership was upheld. Although initially seen as a major win for the BSA, this decision led to funding issues with several 






United Way





 chapters, government entities and more limited recruiting access to schools.


Membership in the BSA's traditional programs (Boy Scouting, Cub Scouting and Venturing) steadily declined during Williams' tenure. Several Councils, most notably the councils in 
Dallas, Texas, 

Atlanta, Georgia
 and 

Birmingham, Alabama
 were embroiled in charges of false membership claims.  


Williams announced his retirement on 
February 7, 
2007, which was effective 
September 1, 
2007. His successor, 

Robert J. Mazzuca
, was named on 
May 22, 
2007.


Williams graduated in 1971 from the 

University of Texas at Arlington
 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.


He is a veteran of the 










United States Air Force









.


Williams was a Scout while a youth in Dallas, Texas.



Honors and awards


Williams is a Chief in the 

Tribe of Mic-O-Say
 and a 
Vigil Honor member of the 

Order of the Arrow
. He is a recipient of the Order's 
Distinguished Service Award


The Nonprofit Times, a publication covering the field of nonprofit management, named Williams as one the nation's top 50 outstanding leaders of nonprofit organizations for 2005.

Billy Graham (deceased) was an 
African-American 
comic-book 
artist best known for his work on the 

Marvel Comics
 series 








Luke Cage, Hero for Hire







 and on the feature  
The Black Panther  in 
Jungle Action. He is not related to the 
televangelist 


Billy Graham

.


Biography



Early career


Among the artist Graham's earliest comics work was 
writer 
Don Glut's  Death Boat!  in the landmark 







Vampirella






 #1 (Sept. 1969), one of the earliest of 
Warren Publishing's influential black-and-white 
horror-comics 
magazines. Graham went on to 
pencil and self-
ink a story in nearly each of the first dozen issues of Vampirella, and an additional tale in the brethren title 










Creepy









 #32 (April 1970).


Publisher James Warren, in 1999, recalled that he promoted Graham to 
art director shortly after recruiting him as an artist:





 

 I sensed Billy had the ability to handle it; certain artists and writers are great but they can't shift out of their specialty and do something else. Billy could. So I said, 'Billy, you are now art director! Whether you like it or not.' Now you have to understand that all Billy wanted to do his whole life was just be 

Jack Kirby
. I said, ' You'll be the Black Jack Kirby, but not today! Today you are art director of Warren Publishing.' But he said, 'I can't art direct!' And I said, 'I'll show you how. There's your office; you now have a full-time job. A paycheck every Friday. Do you accept?' And he said, 'Yer goddamn right!' And I taught him how to art direct during our slow period, and it only took a couple of issues   and he did pretty well (though I gave him a nervous breakdown).1

 





A 2005 newspaper interview with Warren recalled his tweaking a 

Rolling Stone
 reporter who asked about his decision to hire an African-American art director, a rarity in comics at the time:   'What!?' mock-screamed Warren. 'Is Billy Black? I didn't know that. Get him in here! Billy, are you Black? You're fired!'  2




Marvel Comics





Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #5 (Jan. 1973). Hell up in Harlem by artist Billy Graham.



Graham eventually left Warren and joined the creative team that launched Marvel's Luke Cage, Hero for Hire, inking the premiere issue (June 1972) over pencilers 
John Romita Sr. and 

George Tuska
. He either inked or himself penciled every issue of the book's 16-issue run under its original title, and the first as the retitled 








Luke Cage, Power Man







 (Feb. 1974). Graham is also credited as co-writer of issues #14-15, though as writer 






Tony Isabella





 recalls,  Billy Graham is credited as the co-scripter of my first issue [#14] and, try as I might, I simply do not recall getting anything other than the usual penciled pages to script. I skimmed a little of that issue and, making no judgment as to whether this is a good or bad thing, the writing does strike me as all mine .3


Graham's scratchy yet increasingly lyrical style became honed in collaboration with writer 






Don McGregor





 on the critically lauded  Black Panther  series that ran in Jungle Action #6-24 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1976). Graham penciled issues #10-22, the bulk of that series' run, and went on to illustrate issues #3-9 of McGregor's 1980s 
Eclipse Comics series 






Sabre





, a spin-off of one the first 
graphic novels.


Graham also illustrated a story each by McGregor in Marvel's black-and-white horror-comics magazine Monsters Unleashed #11 (April 1975); an issue of the 1980s anthology Eclipse Monthly; and two issues of the black-and-white Eclipse magazine. Graham both wrote and drew the six-page story  The Hitchhiker  in Eclipse magazine #5 (March 1982).


He additionally illustrated the Marvel story  More Than Blood , scripted by 
science-fiction author 

George Alec Effinger
, in 
Journey into Mystery vol. 2, #2 (Dec. 1972); and two    stories by 

Doug Moench
 in the black-and-white magazine Haunt of Horror #2-3 (July-Aug. 1974), as well as a Moench story in the black-and-white Vampire Tales #2 (Oct. 1974).


Graham's last comics work was co-penciling, with Steven Geiger, 
Power Man and Iron Fist (the again-retitled Luke Cage series) #114 (Feb. 1985), written by Jim Owsley (also known as 
Christopher Priest).




Later career


A playwright and occasional actor, Graham had small roles in the 

New York City
-filmed 
movies Scenes from a Mall, directed by 



Paul Mazursky


, and The Super (both 1991). He also played a role as the artist father of one of the lead characters in McGregor's unreleased, low-budget movie adaptation of his 





Detectives Inc.




 graphic novels.




Bob Almond
, inker for much of the run of the 1998 
The Black Panther series, dedicated its issue #17 (April 2000) to Graham, who died in the late 1990s.





Quotes


Don McGregor:  Billy sadly died a couple of years ago, and this industry has virtually not made a mention of his passing and his contributions. He was a great friend, who first introduced me to many wild places in New York City, and a true talent, from stand-up comedy to artist to actor to playwright .4


Don Hilliard reviewing the reprint collection Essential Luke Cage, Power Man :  The majority of the art is by George Tuska, initially inked by Billy Graham (with several solo pieces by Graham [that] give an intriguing record of his progression as an artist: His initial work has a rough, half-finished look to it, but his later issues are clean and beautifully detailed).... 5


Buzz Maverick, Ain't It Cool News, on Jungle Action:  I know the artist, Billy Graham, was Black. His cool Marvel Bullpen name was 'The Irreverent' Billy Graham. For me, even though I later learned that Jack Kirby created the Panther, Graham will always be the definitive Panther artist. His art, even more than McGregor's writing, made T'Challa one of what I call the 'grown men' of the Marvel Universe, the others being 

















Daredevil
















 and 
Iron Man. Those three seemed like the kind of adult I aspired to be, with cool jobs, cool hobbies (superheroing), and cool chicks .6

Types of cancer
Lymphatic system




Lymphangioma,is a lymphatic malformation,a benign proliferation of 
lymph vessels, or a yellow-ish tumor on the skin, composed of a mass of dilated lymph vessels. It is often removed by surgery or a form of surgery using an electric current(electrocoagulation) for cosmetic reasons. It is rare, incidence estimated to be around 1 per 10 000 live births. They are fluid filled sacs that result from blockage of the lymphatic system. They are often associated with karyotype abnormalities such as 
Turner syndrome.
These tumors may occur anywhere but usually occur in the head and neck (75%), with a predilection for the left side. Most (90%) are either evident at birth or become evident before age 2 years. Other types of Lymphangioma are Cystic lymphangioma, Lymphangioma cavernosum and Lymphangioma circumscriptum. 



The tumor is a 
hamartoma or vascular developmental abnomality arising from lymphatic vessels, manifesting as a raised, soft, shaggy, bubbly, pinkish-white lesion; cosmetic considerations may warrant attempted removal of lymphangiomas.




Types of Lymphangioma


Lymphangioma circumscriptum - Also referred to as cutaneous this is a  kind  of birthmark generally occurring in clusters. They resemble small blisters and range in color from pink to dark red. They are benign and usually require no medical treatment. For cosmetic reasons, some patients may choose to have them surgically removed. Lymphangiomas Simplex is often included in this type.This is also a type of tumor that is commonly seen in younger children. 1


Cavernous lymphangioma - This is an uncommon form generally arising during infancy. These are deep seated underneath the dermis and the external skin is not involved. Because they are deep seated, they form a bulging mass, painless mass. This is also a tumor filled with lymph that is often mixed with blood. It usually affects the tongue and lips. 


Cystic Hygroma - These are soft lymph filled masses within a thin-walled  sac  generally appearing on the neck (75%), arm pit or groin areas. They usually present a swollen bulges underneath the skin. While they generally present at birth, children up to three years old may experience them. There is also disagreement on whether this type is distinctly different enough from cavernous lymphangioma to be classified separately.




Lymph Nodes


One of many small oval structures that filter the lymph, fight infection and in which there are formed white blood cells and blood plasma cells. They come in various sizes, they can range from being as small as a pin head or as big as a bean. Each node is enclosed in a fiberous capsule and consist of closely packed white cells(lymphocytes) connected tissue and lymph path ways.Most lymph nodes are clustered in certain areas, such as mouth, neck, lower armpit and groin.For example visceral lymph nodes filter lymph circulating in the lymphatic vessals of the viscera of the chest, lower body and pelvis. The lymphatic network and nodes of the breast are especially crucial in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in women also called lymph gland.



A Lymph is a clear, watery, sometimes faintly yellowish fluid derived from body tissues that contains white blood cells and circulates throughout the lymphatic system, returning to the venous bloodstream through the thoracic duct. Lymph acts to remove bacteria and certain proteins from the tissues, transport fat from the small intestine, and supply mature lymphocytes to the blood.2


A Lymph Gland is any of the small bodies located along the lymphatic vessels, particularly at the neck, armpit, and groin, that filter bacteria and foreign particles from lymph fluid. During infection, lymph nodes may become swollen with activated lymphocytes.


A Lymphatic Vessel is any of the vascular channels that transport lymph throughout the lymphatic system and freely anastomose with one another.3






 Causes 


There is no known cause for these lymphatic abnormalities. There are some suggested reasons but none are certain. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is one of the most likely causes of this cosmetic deformity.Other hypotheses have been made but most likely are not true. 4





Effects from Surgery



 Eighteen patients were treated. The average age at initial surgery was 22 weeks (median, 5 weeks). All presented with at least unilateral suprahyoid and infrahyoid cavernous (microcystic) lymphangioma. The tongue base was involved in 11 patients, the parapharyngeal space in 12, and the larynx in 8. 
 Neck dissection was performed initially in all patients. Tracheotomy was performed in 9 patients (50%). Macroglossia was treated by V glossoplasty. Parapharyngeal extensions were treated by cervicotomy or endoscopy, and larynx and tongue base extensions by carbon dioxide laser photocoagulation. Supraglottic laryngectomy was performed in 2 patients. 
 Main Outcome:Residual disease, decannulation, duration of tracheotomy, and persistent respiratory symptoms. 
 Conclusion:Involvement of the upper airway seems to be the determining prognostic factor in extensive lymphangioma. Patients with dyspnea by external compression of cervical lymphangioma on the airway responded well to surgery. Aggressive surgical treatment did not seem to significantly improve the prognosis in patients with intrinsic involvement of the upper airway. The natural evolution of untreated massive lymphangioma has not been documented. Less aggressive, symptomatic therapy may be an alternative to avoid mutilating surgery in patients with intrinsic involvement of the airway. 5




Treatment


Lymphangioma Circumscription is usually succesfully healed when treated with a flashlamp pulsed dye laser. This is cause port-wine stains and other vascular lesions.  6

Names of God
Hindu philosophical concepts




Parameshwara or Parameshwar, also transliterated from 

Sanskrit
 in other ways, is a 
Hindu concept literally meaning the Supreme 
God. The word  param  meaning the highest is added to 


Ishwara

 to intensify the title of God.


Conceptualization



Same as Absolute Reality or Absolute Truth (See 


Para Brahman

). The term Parameshwara (Supreme Lord) is used specifically indicate The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is also the  supreme controller . This is generally so in order to stress superiority over a contrasting term 
Maheshvara (Great Lord), or the term 


Ishvara

 (Lord). And yet it is common that in many Vedic scriptures the term 


Ishvara

 is used as a short form for Parameshwara. 

Brahma Samhita
 declares 














Krishna













 as Parameshwara:


isvara paramah krishna sac-cid-ananda vigrahah anadir adir govindah sarva karana karanam


Lord Krishna is the supreme absolute controller, whose form comprises immortality, omniscience, and bliss. He is without beginning, the origin of all, the cause of all causes and the source of the Vedas. (

Brahma Samhita
 5.1)

Desks





An escritoire is a small, portable writing 
desk with a sloping front door, 
hinged at the bottom edge, that can be opened downwards to provide a writing surface.  It is usually larger than a 
lap desk.  The interior may contain small drawers designed to hold the traditional ink pot, sand container, blotter and writing feathers or pens.  This type of antique appeared in the 16th century in 
Europe and was produced in large quantities in 

France
 in the 18th century.  Modern reproductions are sometimes made of this compact desk form.

Wedmore

3145





Wedmore, is a village and 
civil parish in the county of 
Somerset, 

England
. It is situated on raised ground, in the 







Somerset Levels






 between the 
River Axe and 





River Brue




, often called the Isle of Wedmore. It forms part of 



Sedgemoor


 district. The parish consists of three main villages, Wedmore, 

Blackford
 and Theale, with fourteen hamlets including Bagley, Cocklake, Mudgley and Panborough. Wedmore has a population of 3,145 according to the 2001 census,


Its facilities include doctors, a dentist, butchers, a village store, three pubs and several other small shops. It is located 4 miles (6 km) south of 
Cheddar, 7 miles (11 km) west of the city of 
Wells and 7 miles north west of 

Glastonbury
.



History


Iron Age remains have been found in the area and there are a number of Roman sites in the district.


The name Wedmore in Old English probably means hunting lodge and there was a Saxon royal estate in the area. After winning the 

Battle of Edington
 Alfred the Great caused the Viking leader 









Guthrum








 and his followers to be baptised at 

Aller
 and then celebrated at Wedmore. After this the Vikings withdrew to East Anglia.


The 









Treaty of Wedmore








 is a term used by Historians for an event referred to by the monk 


Asser

 in his Life of Alfred, outlining how in 
878 the 
Viking leader 
Guthrum accepted 


Alfred the Great

 as his adoptive father.  No such treaty still exists but there is a document that is not specifically linked to Wedmore that is a 
Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum.1


In 1853 a hoard of 200 silver coins dating from the 










Saxon









 period was found in the churchyard. In 1998 a Saxon ring, made of 
copper alloy with a unique knot design, dating from the 
6th or 
7th century was found in the village by Tim Purnell. It has been authenticated by the 

British Museum
 and a modern copy made by local 
jeweller Erica Sharpe.2


According to 












Domesday Book











, Wedmore was one of the holdings of the Bishop of Wells with 18 cottages, woodlands, pasture and two fisheries.


The Church of St Mary is predominantly from the 15th century, although some 12th and 13th century work survives. The tower, with its set-back buttresses, includes triple 2-light bell chamber windows, those to centre are louvred, those to each side blank.3 There is a 14th century wall painting of St Christopher.


In the medieval period Wedmore was the centre for the surrounding agricultural area, with weekly markets as well as a larger annual one. The market cross dates from the 14th century.


In the 17th century Dr John Westover built a mental hospital to which patients came from all over the West Country. This is believed to have been England's first private lunatic asylum. Apparently the doctor treated his patients compassionately, ensuring that they had luxuries such as playing cards and tobacco.  He also kept a record of the ailments of Wedmore people over a period of 15 years.


The Post Office dates from Georgian times while the Old Vicarage was built at the end of the 15th century. The George Hotel was a 16th century coaching inn and the Chemist's shop in Church Street was a Victorian department store.


Between 1881 and 1898 the Rev Hervey produced the Wedmore Chronicle which gives a picture of the people and area at the time.




Culture


Wedmore has a number of annual village festivals, a summer street fair, Wedmore by Lamplight street fair at Christmas, and a large 
Harvest Home and village parade on the playing field each year. Local people created and host the original 



Turnip Prize


, a parody of the 






Turner Prize





. Wedmore hosts Somerset's largest beer festival, the Wedmore Real Ale Festival.




 Notable residents





 

Gary Glitter
, disgraced rock star, once had a country home in Wedmore.4

Shi'a and 

Ali




(This article is an encyclopedia entry on Ali ibn Abi Talib that is to be compiled with the objective of providing an alternate, but equally qualified, historical biography from the overlooked historical records and personal accounts of 
Orthodox Shi'a sources.)


 Al  ibn Ab  T lib (

Arabic
:                 lrm;) b. (13 
Rajab, 24 

BH
 21 
Ramadan, 40 AH) (approximately: 
March 17 
599 - 
February 28 
661) was cousin and son-in-law to 
Prophet 





Muhammad




, as well as a member of the Prophet's 
Ahl al-Bayt 
http://al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter1a/3.html. He is regarded as the first 
Imam and is considered, along with his descendants, to be one of the









divinely appointed successors of Muhammad








 who are the only legitimate religious and political leaders of the Muslim community.
http://al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter3/6.html Though Imam Ali was regarded, during the lifetime of 





Muhammad




, as the Prophet's initial successor, it would be 25 years before he was recognized with the title of 
Caliph (successor).


Tradition states that Ali was born in 
Mecca (inside the 
Ka'ba 
http://www.jafariyanews.com/articles/2k3/11sep_birthinkaaba.htm), to the tribe 



Quraysh


. Ali's father, 
Abu Talib ibn  Abd al-Muttalib, was custodian of the 
Ka'ba and a 
Sheikh of 
Banu Hashim; an important branch of the powerful tribe of the Quraysh. His mother was 
Fatimah binte Asad who was also from Banu Hashim. In Arab culture, this was a great honor for Ali that both of his parents were belong to Banu Hashim. Ali was also one of descendants of 
Ismail the son of 
Ibrahim.


During his childhood, Ali had spent his first six years under his father's house until, as a result of famine in and around Mecca, he was requested by the Prophet to leave his father's house and come to the house of his cousin, the 
Prophet 





Muhammad




. 
http://www.balagh.net/english/shia/shia/10.htm#00011 It would be another four years until Muhammad would announce his 
Prophethood. When the divine command came for Muhammad to begin to preach, Imam Ali, only a child of ten years, arose and was the first male to publicly announce his support for his cousin. 
http://www.al-islam.org/kaaba14/4.htm Over the coming years, Ali stood firmly in his support of Muhammad during the 
persecution of Muslims in 
Mecca.


Ali 
migrated to 
Medina shortly after 





Muhammad




. There 





Muhammad




 told Ali that he had been ordered by God to give his daughter, 

Fatimah
, to Ali in marriage. 
http://www.al-islam.org/gracious/26.htm For the ten years that Muhammad led the community in 
Medina, Ali was extremely active in his service, leading parties of warriors on raids, and carrying messages and orders. With the exception of 
Tabuk, Ali took part in all the battles fought for Islam during this time.


After the assassination of the third Caliph, 




Uthman Ibn Affan



, the Companions of Muhammad in Medina selected Ali to be the new Caliph. He encountered defiance and civil war (

First Fitna
) during his reign. Tragically, while Ali was praying in the 
mosque of 









Kufa








, 
Ibn Muljam, a 
Khawarij assassin, struck him with a poison-coated sword. Ali died on the 21st of Ramadan in the city of Kufa in 661 CE. Imam Ali is highly regarded for his knowledge, belief, honesty, devotion to Islam, loyalty to Muhammad, his equal treatment of all Muslims, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies. In addition, he is respected as the rightful successor of 
Prophet 





Muhammad




. 
http://www.al-islam.org/kaaba14/4.htm#Designation%20of%20Ali%20as%20successor%20to%20the%20Prophet. Ali retains his stature as the foremost authority on the 

Tafsir
 (
Quranic 
exegesis), 
Fiqh (
Islamic jurisprudence) and religious thought.


The compilation of sermons, lectures, and quotations attributed to Ali are compiled in the form of several books. 


Nahj al-Balagha

 is the most revered of them. It is considered by historians and scholars to be an important work in Islamic literature.

Early life



Fatimah binte Asad, the wife of 
Abu Talib, pregnant with Ali, completed her pregnancy term of 270 days but had not yet been induced into labor to give birth to the post-term baby. Abu Talib suggested to his wife that she perform circumambulations around the 
Ka'ba and pray for divine assistance. In the midst of performing her rounds, she went into labor; at one corner of the Ka'ba, designated as the 
Rukne Yamani, the Ka'ba split open and she was given a push from behind towards the direction of the opening.


Inside the Ka'ba Fatimah gave birth to Ali, and it wasn't until 





Muhammad




 had looked upon the infant that the infant's eyelids opened. At the time of Ali's birth a special relationship was hence imparted between Muhammad and Ali, and would be manifested from the time of the 
Prophet's Call in the year 610 A.D. until the Prophet's demise in the year 632. 
http://www.bohra.net/archive/successor.html Imam Ali would be given the privilege of being to only person to be born inside the Ka'ba. 
http://www.victorynewsmagazine.com/TheLifeofImamAliA.htm#History%20of%20The%20Holy%20Kaaba


In a Muslim tradition regarded as authentic by Shias and included in 
Mawaddat al-Qurba and 
Peshawar Nights, Alis mother 
Fatima bint Asad named him after her father, Asad. 
Abu Talib did not agree with her and said:




 O Fatima! Let us go to the Qubais hills, and invoke Allah (some reporters say that he said they should go to the 
Al-Masjid al-Haram). He may tell us the name of this child. 


The answer to the prayer was Ali, derived from one of 
99 Names of God, Al Ali (The Exalted) 
ref.




Upbringing


When Ali was about six years of age, Muhammad was granted permission from his uncle 
Abu Talib to bring him up as his own child. From his earliest days, Ali came directly under the tutelage of the Apostle of Allah, to share his high ethics and morals. For ten years, Imam Ali remained in the care of 





Muhammad




. The 
Prophet had kept him so close and inseparable that he was one with him in character, knowledge, self-sacrifice, forbearance, bravery, kindness, generosity, oratory and eloquence. From his very infancy, he prostrated himself before God along with the Holy Prophet, as he himself said, 
http://www.victorynewsmagazine.com/TheLifeofImamAliA.htm#Imam%20Ali's%20A.S%20Upbringing




 I was the first to pray to God along with the Holy Prophet.

http://www.victorynewsmagazine.com/TheLifeofImamAliA.htm#Ali%20(A.S.)%20was%20Born%20a%20Muslim. His announcement came with the Prophet's first speech, directed to his family, about his divinely appointed mission. Tradition states that when the 
verse  And warn your close tribe (
Quran 26:214)  was revealed to the Prophet, he called Ali and said to him,




 Ali, God has commanded me to warn my tribe of near kindred. I was troubled by this, since I knew that when I discuss the matter to them they would respond in a way which I would not like. I kept silent until Gabriel came to me and said  If you do not do what you are commanded, your Lord will punish you.  So prepare a measure of wheat for us, add a leg of lamb to it, fill a large bowl of milk for us, and then invite sons of Abd al-Muttalib for me so that I may speak to them what I have been commanded to tell them. 


Once the Prophet had gathered the members of 





Banu Abd al-Muttalib




 he spoke to them, saying,




 Banu Abd al-Muttalib, I don't know of any young man among Arabs who has brought for his people something better than what I have brought to you. I bring the best of this world and the world after, since God has commanded me to summon you to him. Which of you will aid me in this matter, so that he will be my brother, my executor (Wasi), my successor (Caliph) among you? 


They all held back from the words of the Prophet, and though Ali was the youngest, he replied,




 I will be your helper, O' Prophet of Allah.  He put his hand on the back of Ali's neck and said  This is my brother, my executor (
Wasi), my successor (
Caliph) among you, so listen to him and obey him. 


Some Banu Abd al-Muttalib rose up laughing and saying to Ali's father, Abu Talib,




 He has commanded you to obey your son and to obey him!

Boycott of Banu Hashim


Muhammad s denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe, the 



Quraysh


, as they were the guardians of the 
Ka'aba. So they persecuted Muslims. According to the tradition, the leaders of Makhzum and Abd Shams, two important clans of Quraysh, declared a public boycott against the clan of Banu Hashim, their commercial rival in order to put pressure on the clan.


At this time, Muhammad arranged for some of his followers to emigrate to Ethiopia. The boycott lasted for three years. Ali stood firmly in support of Muhammad during the years of 
persecution of Muslims and 
boycott of Banu Hashim in Mecca.




Migration to Medina





See also: 
Hijra (Islam)

In 622 CE, the year of Muhammad's 
migration to 
Yathrib (now Medina), Ali risked his life by sleeping in Muhammad's bed to impersonate him and thwart an assassination plot, so that Muhammad could escape in safety.12
This night is called  Laylat Al-mabit . According to some 
hadith a verse was revealed about Ali concerning his sacrifice on the night of 
hijrah which says  And among men is he who sells his NAFS (self) in exchange for the pleasure of Allah 3 4


Ali survived the plot, but risked his life again by staying in Mecca to carry out Muhammad's instructions: to restore to their owners all the goods and properties that had been entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping. Then he went to Medina with Fatima binte Asad (his mother), 

Fatimah
 (the daughter of Muhammad), and two other women. 1


The Muhammed went on his final hajj (pilgrimage) and whne returning, he called all those who where ahead to come back and those who were behind to come ahead. they had stopped at a place called khumm. The prohet sat on a pulpit made of saddles. he then said  man kuntu mawla hu fa hadha aliun mawla.  which is translated as whoevers master i am ali is also his master. the sunni's translate it however as howevers 'friend' i am ali is also his friend.




Succession to Muhammad


After Mohummad's death, a sudden panic overcame the many tribes within the 


Arabian Peninsula

. The question of succession as to who would receive the 
Caliphate. Though it was well known through many 
traditions related by the 
Prophet and 







Qur'an






 as to who was to succeed Muhammad (Imam Ali 
http://www.al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter4/4.html), a small number of prominent 
companions took to the  Saqifah Bani Sa'ida  or 
Saqifah, a roofed building used by the tribe of Sa'ida, in the city of 
Medina, to decide amongst themselves as to who was going to lead the 
muslims. 
http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/index.php Such companions as 




Abu Bakr



, 
Umar ibn al-Khattab, and 
Sa'd ibn Ubadah ,who was killed at Saqifah 
http://www.al-shia.com/html/eng/books/beliefs/root-of-the-religion/ror27.htm, were present. The small secret band of companions exchanged arguments until the majority gave their 
bay'at (allegiance) to Abu Bakr.




Abu Bakr's era


Shia believe that the reason Ali did not aid Abu Bakr in the Rida wars was that those getting killed by Abu Bakr were his Shia.




Umar's era



Ali Asgher Razwy, a 
20th century 
Shi'a 
Twelver  
Islamic scholar states:





 

 

Umar
, on his deathbed, 
had appointed six 
Muhajireen as members of 
a panel which was to choose one out of themselves as the future khalifa of the Muslims. They were 

Ali ibn Abi Talib
, 
Uthman, 
Talha, 
Zubayr, 
Abdur Rahman bin Auf and 
Saad bin Abi Waqqas. Except Ali, all other members of the panel were 
capitalists, or rather, neo-capitalists. When they came from 
Makkah, they were penniless and homeless but within twelve years, i.e., from the death of 





Muhammad Mustafa




 in 632 to the death of Umar in 644, each of them, except Ali, had become 










rich like Croesus









. Between these two dates, they had accumulated immense wealth, and had become the richest men of their times.

Ali did not qualify as a member of this exclusive  club  but Umar admitted him anyway. Apart from the fact that Ali made his living as a gardener whereas his other five co-members lived on the revenues of their lands and estates, there was another gulf, even more unbridgeable, that separated him from them. In character, personality, temperament, attitudes, philosophy and outlook on life, Ali and the rest of them were the antithesis of each other. 5


 







Uthman's era




A 
narration attributed to 

Ali
  reports:



 

 `Othman ordered that I should have audience with him on a very hot day. I placed my garment on my head and went to see him. I entered, and he was on his bed, a rod in hand, surrounded by rich wealth: two heaps of gold and silver. He said, `Take of this whatever you wish so you may have enough (i.e. buy enough food) to fill your stomach, for you have burnt me.  I said to him, `You have surely been kind to your kin! If this wealth is an inheritance which you have inherited, or a giver gave it to you personally, or you earned it from a trade deal, I would then be one of two: I may either take of it or simply thank you for your offer [but not accept it], or I may refrain so I may work hard (to earn my living). But if it is a wealth that belongs to Allah, and the Muslims are to partake of it, and so are the orphans and the wayfarers, then by Allah, you have no right to give me any of it, nor do I have any right to take any of it.  He said, `I, by Allah, insist that you should do what you have refused to do.  Then he kept hitting me with the rod. By Allah, I did not keep his hand away from me till he had enough. I pulled my garment over my head and went back home. I said, `Allah is between you and me if I enjoined on you to do what is right or prohibited you from doing wrong.6

 


 





Titles


The Shi'a give these titles to Ali:



 Al-  diq (The Truthful)''


 
Imam (commander/leader)''


 Imam Al-Muttaqin (Leader of those established in the faith)


 Al-Murtadh  (Murtaz  in Persian) (The chosen one)''


 Al-Naba' ul 'Adh m


 Haydar








 Safder


 Al-Almd r (The standard bearer)''


 Mushkil-Kush  (The solver of problems)''


 Al-Furuq






Please note that translation from Arabic to English may change the way the words are interpreted


Ali is given an additional pious modifier. When Ali's name is mentioned, along with  May Allah be pleased with him , Shi'a add  Allah has honoured his face , a reference to the Shi'a belief that Ali converted to Islam at such a young age that he never joined in any worship of the traditional Meccan gods, whom the Muslims believe to be 
idols. His face, they say, was never defiled by prostrations before idols.

Thapsacus

Hebrew Bible places




Thapsacus (Hebrew: Tiphsah [        ]), meaning 
ford or passage) was an ancient town along the western bank of the 



Euphrates


 river that would now lie in modern 

Syria
 or 
Turkey. Thapsacus was the Greek and Roman name for the town. The town was important and prosperous due to its river crossing, which allowed east-west land traffic to pass through it.


Location





King David's Empire and A, B, C: three alternative locations of Thapsacus (referred here as Tipsah)



Its exact location is unknown but is said to be 100 miles north-east of 
Tadmor. This is most commonly associated with the modern town of 
Deir; however the only ford in the region is at 
Suriyeh where the town is now assumed to have been. Another possible location described by 
Conder in 










Easton's Bible Dictionary of 1897









, however, identifies this place with 
Khurbet Tafsah, some 6 miles west of 








Shechem







; this however is unlikely. There is further suggestion that the town may be associated with 
Carchemish 1; however this may be unlikely as the towns referenced as 
Europus and 












Amphipolis











 are separate and there is no other indication that the cities could be the same as Thapsacus. Another reference does suggest that the town was near  Jarablos , another name for 
Carchemish 2 .


The city's identification with Carchemish is supported by its similar role. In neo-Assyrian times the city of Carchemish was the main crossing point on the Euphrates. For many centuries it had been the capital city of the major neo-Hittite kingdom in north-western Syria. Trade between east and west past through it and because of this its system of weights and measures became a standard that was later adopted by the Assyrians and referred to as the Carchemish standard. This standard in trade with Syria (known as 
Ebir-nari,  across the river , in cuneiform texts) continued into neo-Babylonian and Persian times as illustrated by a letter from year 9 of Kura /Cyrus where this standard was then known as the measure of Tapsu #x1e2b;u.3 The continued importance of the city is the reason Eratosthenes choose Thapsakos as one of the reference points for his system of latitude and longitude.


Thapsakos' identification with Europos (the Hellenistic name of Carchemish) finds some support from a corrupt passage in 





















Plinius




















' 









Naturalis Historia''








. In his description of places along the Euphrates, from source to mouth, he gives the following account of the right bank of the Euphrates between Zeugma and Sura.4  And in Syria [it flows past the following] towns: Europus formerly Thapsacus, now Amphipolis, the Tent-Dwelling Arabs. Thus it continue to the place called Sura . The passage reads as if there should be a list of towns and we know from classical references that there were other towns along this strip.5 In addition it is known that Amphipolis was different from Europus as Stephanos of Byzantine says it was called Tourmeda by the locals. One solution is to read the town list as  Europus formerly Thapsacus, ..., [Tourmeda] now Amphipolis, ...  (where the remaining towns have fallen out of the passage).6 


A second classical source which supports the identification of Thapsakos with Carchemish is the 401 B.C. marching itinerary of Cyrus the Younger as given by 


















Xenophon

















, in his 








Anabasis







. Farrell has shown that the march rates support a crossing at Carchemish, then across to the Balikh and then down hat river to its junction with the Euphrates.7 It is the same road outlined in 
Isidoros of Kharax'  Parthian Stations , except that there the route started from Zeugma.8 


The town has also been linked with Dibse/Al-Dibsi 9 . Further it has been linked with the town of Balis in Halab district in Syria 10 11 12.




References to Thapsacus



Classical References





Thapsacus is mentioned in 


















Xenophon

















's 








Anabasis







 as the a  large and prosperous city  where 










Cyrus the Younger









's armies stayed five days and where Cyrus revealed to his generals that they would be marching on 










Babylon









.

















Arrian













's Anabasis of Alexander mentions that Darius Codomannus  made a forced march toward the city of Thapsacus and the river Euphrates  and later that Alexander arrived there to find two boat-bridges had been erected across the river.  


 








Strabo







's 
Geographika states that there was a bridge over the Euphrates at Thapsacus, and postulates that the width of Mesopotamia may have been measured from this point to a bridge on the Tigris.


 





















Pliny the Elder




















's 









Naturalis Historia''








 states that Thapsacus later became known as Amphipolis.  In their 
1855 translation of this text, John Bostock and H.T. Riley note that Amphipolis'  ruins are to be seen at the ford of El Hamman, near the modern Rakkah. 






Biblical References


There are two references to Tiphsah in the 
Bible, both of which are the subject of debate over whether or not they refer to Thapsacus:



 In 1 Kings 4:24, Tiphsah is mentioned as one of the boundaries of 


Solomon

's dominions.  
Easton's Bible Dictionary holds that this is probably a reference to Thapsacus, but the 
1911 Encyclopadia Britannica relates that  it is impossible to determine whether the one phrase 'from Tiphsah to Gaza', where the name seems to occur, is as early as the Persian Period: the Greek text is quite discrepant. 


 










Menahem









, King of Israel, undertook an expedition and  smote Tiphsah and all that were therein  (2 Kings 15:16). Easton's states that this expedition implied a march of some 300-400 miles from 





Tirzah




 , apparently indicating their belief that this Tiphsah also refers to Thapsacus.  They acknowledge, however, that some scholars identify this as a reference to Khurbet Tafsah, six miles west of 








Shechem







. The 1911 Britannica states that this verse  cannot possible refer to any place on the Euphrates. 






Babylonian References





 A town called Tapsuhu is mentioned in two Babylonian clay tablets dating in the reigns of 










Nabonidus









 and 


Cyrus the Great

. It has been recently argued that it could be identified with Tapsacus.13






Modern References





 The 1911 Britannica notes that  after various attempts at identification, it has apparently been correctly identified by J. P. Peters (Nation, May 23, 1889) and B. Moritz (Sitz.-Ber. d. Berl. Akad., July 25, 1889). The name may survive in Kal'at Dibse,  a small ruin 8 m[iles] below Meskene, and 6 m[iles] below the ancient 
Barbalissus.

Marvin Gaye







 Romantically Yours  was the second posthumous release for 








American







 
soul music legend 


Marvin Gaye

, also released by 

Columbia Records
 in 1985.


While his previous posthumous album, 
Dream Of A Lifetime, showcased some of Marvin's appetite for 
funk rhythms, this album focused on his attempts at being a pop crooner in the style of idols such as 
Nat  King  Cole. The collection showcased a growth in Gaye's vocal styling as he slowly found his footing as a crooner with songs such as  Just Like ,  Why Did I Choose You  - a track he had originally recorded in 1966 to failed result and later revived for an album he was working on in 1978 titled Ballads (later released as 

Vulnerable
 in 1997) and  Walking in the Rain  which showcased his perfecting falsetto croon to a jazz setting. Most of the collection was recorded for the album with  Why Did I Choose You ,  I Won't Cry Anymore  and  The Shadow of Your Smile  making the Vulnerable album.

In 
atomic physics, the Brackett series is one of several 
series of 
spectral lines produced by 
hydrogen.  The series is named after the American physicist 








Frederick Sumner Brackett







 who first observed the spectral lines in 1922.

The lines appear in emission when hydrogen atoms' electrons descend to the fourth 
energy level from a higher level, and they appear in absorption when the electrons ascends from the fourth energy level to higher levels. These lines lie in the 
infrared part of the 
electromagnetic spectrum, with 
wavelengths ranging from 4.05 
micrometres (
Brackett-alpha) to 1.46 micrometres (the series limit).

Chilcotin Country
Plateaus of British Columbia







Location of the Chilcotin Plateau


The Chilcotin Plateau is a major subdivision of the 





Interior Plateau




 of 

British Columbia
, also known as the Fraser Plateau.  The Chilcotin Plateau is physically near-identical with the region of the same name, i.e. 
 the Chilcotin , which lies between the 



Fraser River


 and the southern 


Coast Mountains

 and is defined by the basin of the 








Chilcotin River







 and so includes montane areas beyond the plateau.   East of the Chilcotin Plateau, across the 



Fraser River


, is the 
Cariboo Plateau, while to the north beyond the 







West Road (Blackwater) River






 is the 





Nechako Plateau




.  West and south of the Chilcotin Plateau are various subdivisions of the 


Coast Mountains

, including the 




Chilcotin Ranges



 which lie along the plateau's southwest.

Included within the definition of the Chilcotin Plateau are the 







Rainbow Range






, near 












Bella Coola











 and the similarly-volcanic 







Ilgachuz Range






 and 







Itcha Range






 both of which are major 
shield volcanoes. The 


Camelsfoot Range

, north of 

Lillooet
, is included in the Chilcotin Plateau by some systems of classification.


The plateau is nearly entirely drained by the 








Chilcotin River







 and its tributaries, the largest of which are the 
Chilanko and 



Chilko River


s.  Also draining the plateau on its eastern edge is 
Churn Creek, which forms the east flank of the 


Camelsfoot Range

 and enters the 



Fraser


 directly.  On the west side of the plateau, the basins of the 



Dean


, 








Homathko







 and 
Atnarko Rivers penetrate the massifs of the 


Coast Mountains

 and have their beginnings, or the early part of their courses, on the Chilcotin Plateau.


The Chilcotin Plateau includes part of the 






Chilcotin Plateau Basalts





, an eroded 
volcanic plateau running parallel to the 









Garibaldi Volcanic Belt








 in southwestern British Columbia. The volcanism within the Chilcotin Plateau Basalts is considered to be a result of extension of the crust behind the costal 











Cascadia subduction zone










.

Quotes





  Lowest average cost wins. 


 How do I know when I'm wrong? When I can no longer get a quote. 


  Countrywide's long term business value... we think is in the $40's compared to its current price of about $14-15. 6


  As for the so-called streak, that s an accident of the calendar. If the year ended on different months it wouldn t be there and at some point the mathematics will hit us. We ve been lucky. Well, maybe it s not 100% luck maybe 95% luck. 7

Structural system
Auto parts




A subframe is a structural component of a vehicle, such as an 
automobile or an 
aircraft, that uses a discrete, separate structure within a larger 
body-on-frame or 
unit body to carry certain components, such as the 
engine, drivetrain, or 
suspension. The subframe is 
bolted and/or 
welded to the vehicle. When bolted, it is sometimes equipped with 
rubber 
bushings or 
springs to 











dampen










 
vibration.

The principal purpose of using a subframe is to isolate vibration and harshness from the rest of the body. For example, in an automobile with its powertrain contained in a subframe, forces generated by the engine and transmission can be damped enough that they will not disturb passengers. As a natural development from a car with a full chassis, separate front and rear subframes are used in modern vehicles to reduce the overall weight and cost. In addition a subframe yields benefits to production in that subassemblies can be made which can be introduced to the main bodyshell when required on an automated line.


There are generally two basic forms of the subframe.



 A simple  axle  type which usually carries the lower control arms and steering rack.


 A perimeter frame which carries the above components but in addition supports the engine.




A subframe is usually made of pressed steel panels which are welded or spot welded together. The use of 
Hydroformed tubes may also be used.



The sub frame saw regular production in the 60's and 70's General Motors X and F cars.

Labour Thanksgiving Day (      , Kinr  kansha no hi) is a national 






holiday





 in 
Japan. It takes place annually on 
November 23. The law establishing the holiday cites it as an occasion for commemorating 
labour and production and giving one another thanks.

Events are held throughout Japan, one such being the 
Nagano Labour Festival. The event encourages thinking about the 
environment, 
peace and 
human rights.


It is not unusual for early grade elementary students to create drawings for the holiday and give them as gifts to local 
kobans, or police stations.



History


Labor Thanksgiving Day is the modern name for an ancient 
rice 
harvest festival known as Niiname-sai (   , Niiname-sai), believed to have been held as long ago as November of 678. Traditionally, it celebrated the year's hard work; during the Niiname-sai ceremony, the 
Emperor would dedicate the year's harvest to 
kami (
spirits), and taste the rice for the first time.


The modern holiday was established after 







World War II






 in 1948 as a day to mark some of the changes of the postwar 
constitution of Japan, including fundamental human rights and the expansion of workers rights. Currently Niiname-sai is held privately by the Imperial Family while Labour Thanksgiving Day has become a national holiday.

Republic of Ireland
. Like the books, the TV series is a number of short stories around a few central characters. The house used as Assolas Castle, the residence of the erstwhile Mrs. Knox (located at Newhall, Naas in Kildare) was badly damaged by fire following completion of filming for the series, it has since been returned to its former glory.
Johnstown Kennedy - the house used as Major Yeates' residence, Shreelane House -  was situated near Rathcoole, Co. Dublin. It was demolished soon after the 3rd series was completed and a golf course now stands on the site.


The various stories concern the life of an Irish ex-
British Army officer 
Resident Magistrate (R.M.) recently appointed to his position in Ireland, which at that stage was still wholly a part of the 











United Kingdom










, and before the creation of the present day Republic of Ireland.


The RM has to deal with all sorts of everyday events with colourful characters, often being outfoxed by the machinations of his 


Anglo-Irish

 friend, Flurry Knox (

Bryan Murray
).


The humour in the series is greatly enhanced if the viewer has a broad understanding of the history of Ireland s relationship with England, and how Ireland was governed, as well as the Irish country way of life. The show is, however, not political, although caricatures of people are used for humorous purposes.


The R.M., Major Yeates, is played by 

Peter Bowles
, who also starred in 

To the Manor Born
   the light-hearted humorous style of the Irish RM has often been compared with To the Manor Born, although in a period Irish context instead of a present-day (as then was) English context.


In one scene, the major s English wife, Philippa (
Doran Godwin) is dancing with a stable-hand, Slipper (







Niall Toibin






), at a servants  ball. Slipper ventures to say that  The English and the Irish understand each other like the fox and the hound,  to which the lady replies in good humour,  But which is which?  The answer is,  Ah well, if we knew that, we d know everything!

 A Break with Charity: A Story about the Salem Witch Trials (ISBN 0-15-204682-8) is a novel by 






Ann Rinaldi





 released in 



1992


, and is part of the Great Episodes series.








 Fictional and Historical Characters in the Novel 



The author of A Break With Charity uses fictional and historical characters both in order to better relate the story of the Salem Witch Trials.  Susanna English, for instance, is a fictional observer: she is the narrator telling the story of the Witch Trials from both inside and outside of the proceedings.  She interacts with historical characters, but did not in fact exist.  Her parents, Mary and Philip English did, and were considered the richest people in Salem. They were both arrested separately, but they were given more privileges in jail.  In the novel, the Englishes (excluding Susanna) fled Salem, leaving Susanna and her sister, Mary, with Joseph and Elizabeth Putnam, aunt and uncle of Ann Putnam. In the end the accuser of the with hunt pleads forgivness and is in turn forgave for her wrong past.


Historical personages featured within the novel include the twenty men and women executed for witchcraft; see 
The Salem Witch Trials for a full list.  Additionally, Betty Parris (Reverend Parris' daughter) and Tituba also existed. The Procters, Putnams, and Parrises were all important historical figures in the history of the Witch Trials.

I N D E X




Drift netting is a 
fishing technique where 
nets, called drift nets, are allowed to drift free in a sea or lake. Usually a drift net is a 
gill net with floats attached to a rope along the top of the net, and weights attached to another rope along the foot of the net. 

Drift nets can range in length from 25m to 2.5 miles. Nets of up to 50km have been set in recent times
http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Drift_netting#endnote_Jennings. Because drift nets are not anchored to the sea bottom or connected to a boat, they are sometimes lost in storms and become 
ghost nets.



Controversy


Controversy around the use of drift nets stems not from their impact on fished populations, which, due to the selectivity parameters of the nets, are well understood, but from their impact on non-target species, particularly 
dolphins and 
turtles.


Driftnets have been commonly used by many countries in coastal waters. However, 
Japanese drift net fishing began to draw public attention in the mid-1980s when Japan and other Asian countries began to send large fleets to the 
North Pacific Ocean to catch mainly 
tuna and 
squid. Japan operated about 900 drift net vessels earning around $300 million a year.
Those fishing boats were blamed not only for the indiscriminate destruction of marine life, but also for the poaching of North Pacific salmon, harming the US and Canadian fishing industries, and threatening the jobs of fishermen who did not use such methods. The first 
Bush administration opposed a U.S. driftnet ban because it would allegedly conflict with a treaty with Japan and Canada regarding salmon fishing in the North Pacific
http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Drift_netting#endnote_US. 


The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which bans drift net fishing in 
international waters effective December, 1992.  The United States still permits drift gillnet fisheries within US waters, and as of March 2007, there are over 1300 vessels fishing with drift nets in European waters 
http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Drift_netting#endnote_Fleet.  The use of drift nets in EU waters is, however, carefully regulated.  Drift nets exceeding 2.5km in length have been banned since the early 1990s.  The use of drift nets of any length in fisheries targeting certain specific species, including tuna and swordfish, was banned in 1998. 
http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Drift_netting#endnote_EU The prohibition on the use of drift nets will be extended to EU waters of the Baltic Sea from 1 January 2008.

Bidborough is a village and 
civil parish in the 



borough of Tunbridge Wells


 in 

Kent
, 

England
, north of 

Tunbridge Wells
 and south of 

Tonbridge
.  According to the 2001 census it had a population of 958.

The village has an active community of residents, well represented across all ages, and village life revolves around the well-ranked primary school, the 'Hare and Hounds' pub, the historic 11th century church of St Lawrence and nearby community hall. The village has its own amateur dramatic group, 'BADS', which puts on well-attended productions twice a year, as well as a youth group, Women's Institute and a gardening association. The village also has its own garage, shop and post office.


Parish sports facilities are good, and the village boasts a tennis court, a bowls green and two recreation ground areas, which are available for cricket and five-a-side football.   


Bidborough has many families who have lived there for generations. However, the village attracts a growing number of London commuters with young families, combining as it does proximity to Gatwick airport, fast rail connections into London and easy access to the M25 with all the benefits of living in rural Kent. The highly rated local grammar schools of Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells, alongside the many prestigious public schools in the area, also make the village an attractive prospect for those who can afford it.

 New Avengers  features 



Mike Gambit


 (

Gareth Hunt
), Purdey (


Joanna Lumley

) and the ubiquitous John Steed (Patrick Macnee).



The New Avengers was a 











British










 
secret agent fantasy adventure television series produced during 
1976 and 
1977. It is a sequel to the 1960s series, 

The Avengers
 which was created by 



Sydney Newman


, and the new version was developed by original series producers 

Brian Clemens
 and 






Albert Fennell





.

A joint UK-

France
-

Canada
 production, the series picks up the adventures of 





John Steed




 (again played by 

Patrick Macnee
) as he and his team of  Avengers  fight evil plots and world domination. Whereas in the original series Steed had almost always been partnered with a woman, in the new series he had two partners: 



Mike Gambit


 (

Gareth Hunt
), a top agent, crack marksman and trained 
martial artist and 



Purdey


 (


Joanna Lumley

), a former trainee with The Royal Ballet (which she claimed was where she learned the high-kicking skills she frequently used in the series) who was an amalgam of many of the best talents from Steed's female partners in The Avengers.



Overview


As he did for most of the original series, Steed is once again acting without a direct superior (in many ways his character takes on the duties of  Mother  from the Tara King era of the 1960s show).  Steed is seen as the mentor to Gambit and Purdey, taking on a paternal role towards them (especially in the episode  Hostage ).  Gambit is the athletic action hero, while Purdey, aside from being the show's resident 
fashion plate, incorporates the wit and fighting skills of her predecessors.  The verbal interplay between Gambit and Purdey, with her humorously keeping his romantic advances at bay, hearkens back to the Steed/Gale era of the original Avengers.


One reason for the addition of Gambit was the question of whether Macnee, at age 53 when the series began production, could handle the potential stuntwork and action scenes.  Macnee was able to increase his role's visibility as the series progressed, losing weight to improve his athleticism and to 'keep up' with his new partners.


The first series featured several episodes using 
science fiction themes similar to those of the classic  Emma Peel  Avengers era.  The new trio had to deal with suspended animation ( The Eagle's Nest ), biological warfare ( The Midas Touch ), robotics ( The Last of The Cybernauts? ), mind transfer ( Three-Handed Game ) and even giant rats ( Gnaws , a title patterned after the hit movie 

Jaws
).  Second series episodes, with the exception of the artificially-intelligent super-computer of  Complex , dealt with more realistic plots.


An attempt to get 

Diana Rigg
 to appear as 





Emma Peel




 in the new series was unsuccessful;  however, archival footage of her from the 1960s was used in order to allow the character to make a cameo appearance in the episode  K Is For Kill Part One: The Tiger Awakes .  

Ian Hendry
, who played Steed's original partner, David Keel, also guest-starred in one episode,  To Catch A Rat , playing a different role.   Obsession  features two of the stars of the Brian Clemens/Albert Fennell British crime-fighting action series 
















The Professionals















 - 

Martin Shaw
 and 

Lewis Collins
.


Two series totalling 26 episodes were produced, which were aired on 

CBS
 in the 








United States







, 
CTV in Canada, 

ITV
 in Britain, 
RTE in Ireland, 

TF1
 in France and in 
syndication elsewhere. 












Laurie Johnson








, who had composed the theme for the original Avengers series (starting with the Emma Peel era in 1965, at least), returned to compose a new, updated theme for the revival.  The new theme, however, begins with the same fanfare as the original.


Fans are divided on the merits of the revival, with many suggesting the show lost its magic. To some extent The New Avengers is a victim of its age, particularly the fashions and the general financial malaise of the 1970s. 

Brian Clemens
 claimed that interference from backers ultimately determined The New Avengers' fate. The French contingent, IDTV of Paris, was unhappy about certain aspects of the show's character, insisting on an injection of outright violence into the action and that Purdey should become more sexually overt. The British team fought back but as relations became increasingly frosty, the flow of agreed funding started to dry up. This resulted in 

Brian Clemens
 having to not only produce the series but also write the majority of stories, as little money was available to hire other writers.  ITC veteran 



Dennis Spooner


 contributed several scripts, though it is rumoured these were largely done as an unpaid favour. 


Committed to completing the planned 26 episodes, finance was sought from other sources. Production company Nielsen Ferns came on board but was understandably keen to promote their own country, so the final four stories, titled The New Avengers in Canada, saw the action move to 

Toronto
, 

Ontario
 (with scenes for the episode  Forward Base  shot at 








Ward's Island







).  By this time 

Brian Clemens
 was heavily committed to another project and control of the series passed to a largely local crew.  The results attracted heavy criticism - from fans and Clemens himself.


The financial problems continued and plans for a third series were abandoned. Subsequently, however, strong sales to many countries - notably 

CBS
 in the 








United States







 - saw two attempts to revive the show (in 1979 and 1980), though co-financing arrangements proved impossible to agree. 


Meanwhile 

Brian Clemens
 was invited to write a pilot for Quinn Martin Productions. Entitled Escapade - Avengers USA it starred 






Granville Van Dusen





 and 


Morgan Fairchild

 as Joshua and Suzy - Gambit and Purdey equivalents.  Airing in 1978 it was deemed unsuccessful and no series followed. 


In 1994 


Joanna Lumley

 and 

Gareth Hunt
 publicised the launch of the series on domestic videocassette.  Sales were stronger than expected, prompting Brian Clemens to consider reuniting the two actors in a  spin-off  series. Although both were keen to participate and a script was written, plans stalled at an early stage for undisclosed reasons. 


In 1995/96, the series was picked up by the 

BBC
, leading to the only time it has received a genuine  network  transmission in the UK. (


Joanna Lumley

 subsequently claimed it is the only screening for which she received repeat fees.)  At the time, French company Canal Plus held transmission prints for the series, but upon delivery the BBC deemed that those for several early episodes were not of  broadcast quality .  As a result, the final four episodes were actually the first to be screened, whilst superior prints were made up.  Nevertheless notable variations in picture and audio quality across the series remain and it awaits genuine remastering from the original negatives.

Wyndham is the oldest and northernmost town in the 






Kimberley region





 of 




Western Australia



, located on the 

Great Northern Highway
, 3,224 
kilometres (2,003 
mi) northeast of 

Perth
. It was established in 1885 as a result of a gold rush at 

Halls Creek
, and it is now a port and service centre for the east Kimberley with a population of 800. Wyndham is split into two areas. The original town site of Wyndham Port is situated on 


Cambridge Gulf

, while Wyndham Three Mile (also known as Wyndham East) is the residential and shopping area of the town. Wyndham is part of the 

Shire of Wyndham-East Kimberley
.



History



The first European to visit the area was 



















Phillip Parker King


















 in 1819. He was instructed to find a river 'likely to lead to an interior navigation into the great continent'. He sailed in to Cambridge Gulf, which he named after the 


Duke of Cambridge

, and then sailed down a river which was subsequently named after him. Finding no fresh water on the mudflats, he departed.


The town of Wyndham was established by 


John Forrest

 in 1885 as the major port and trading station of the East Kimberley, after finds of gold in Halls Creek a year earlier. By 1886, the town was booming. There were six pubs, one of which was a two-storey building. Ships brought in at least five thousand miners who headed off to the Halls Creek goldfields. It is known that during this boom there were times when up to 16 vessels were moored in Cambridge Gulf.


However, by 1888, the gold rush at Halls Creek had ended and the fortunes of Wyndham declined. Wyndham became a tiny settlement serving the pastoral interests in the East Kimberley. By 1912, money had virtually disappeared from the Wyndham economy, and purchases were paid for using promissory notes known as  shinplasters . 


In 1913, the Western Australian government started to construct the Wyndham Meatworks to restart the town's economy. The construction efforts were interrupted by the 







Nevanas affair






 and 

World War I
, but the meatworks were completed in 1919.


During 







World War II






, the town was attacked several times by 

Japanese
 aircraft.


Wyndham's significance as a service centre was also reduced by the construction of the town of 

Kununurra
 in the early 1960s.


The meatworks continued to be the mainstay of the town's economy until their closure in 1985.




Geography and climate


Wyndham is located at the west arm of 


Cambridge Gulf

, an inlet of 


Joseph Bonaparte Gulf

 of the 
Timor Sea. It is surrounded by the Durack, Pentecost and King rivers to the south, Forrest River to the west and 

Ord River
 to the north. Much of the land around Wyndham is inhospitable, and includes the jagged hills of the Bastion Range and the 
mudflats of the Cambridge Gulf.


The climate of Wyndham is 
tropical, with the wet season from late November to March and the dry season from April to early November. The hottest month is November with an average maximum temperature of 39.4 C (102.9 F), and the coolest months of June and July have an average maximum of 31.2 C (86.4 F). The annual average maximum temperature is 35.6 C (96.1 F,), one of the highest in Australia. In 1946, Wyndham recorded 333 consecutive days of temperatures over 32 C (90 F).

Facilities





View from Bastion Lookout, Wyndham



There are two schools, Wyndham District High School (k-12)   St Joseph's Catholic School (k-6), one 
TAFE campus, and a daycare centre. There is also an outdoor swimming   recreational centre for leisure. For tourists, there are two hotels and a caravan park. Wyndham is served by Wyndham Airport. The nearby Bastion lookout provides  sweeping vistas of the surrounding country including the five rivers named above which emerge into Cambridge Gulf.

Jersey Airport (
IATA: JER, 
ICAO: EGJJ) is located in the parish of 

Saint Peter
 in 
Jersey, one of the 

British
 
Crown dependencies in the 
Channel Islands.


History


Air service to Jersey before 1937 consisted of biplane airliners and some 
seaplanes landing on the beach at 
Saint Aubin's Bay.  Jersey Airways and 




Imperial Airways



 were among those who operated to the island before the war, but conditions were difficult as timetables were governed by tides. It was also difficult to prevent members of the public from walking across the landing area, and any aircraft which had mechanical problems had to be dragged up the slipways until the tide receded.


The 








States of Jersey







 decided to build an airport which opened on 
10 March 
1937 with four grass runways, the longest of 2,940 feet (896 metres) with a concrete centreline. Concrete taxiways were added during the 





World War II occupation




 by the 

Luftwaffe
   they also built hangars, one of which is still in existence.  A 4,200 feet (1,280 metre) 
tarmac runway was opened in 1952 and the grass strips were closed. A feature of the airport in the 1950s was the traffic control system   traffic-lights were in place to prevent vehicles using the road from Les Quennevais to the Airport when planes were being moved to or from the hangar used by 






B.E.A.








The runway was lengthened several times over the years, reaching its current length in 1976.  Additional taxiways were added several years later to improve access to the one end of the runway. However, due to its restricted length, in October 2007 

Thomsonfly
 announced the removal of some services as it introduces the larger 
Boeing 737-800 to its fleet.1


Approximately 80,000 aircraft movement annually and 1.5 million passenger movements take place at the airport.2




Terminal





Arms and date on the original 1937 tower



The 1937 terminal was designed with the control tower between the arrivals and departures areas.  The terminal was extended in 1976 and again in 1997.

Sri Lanka independence struggle
History of Sri Lanka
Politics of Sri Lanka




The Suriya-Mal Movement was formed in 











British










 ruled 
Ceylon (

Sri Lanka
) to sell Suriya (
Portia tree) flowers on 
Poppy Day for the benefit of Sri Lankan 
ex-servicemen. The movement became 
anti-imperialist in character. It was also involved in relief work during the Malaria epidemic of 
1934-
1935.


 Beginnings 



In protest against the proceeds of 
Poppy sales on 















Armistice Day














 (
11 November) being used for the benefit of the British ex-servicemen to the detriment of Sri Lankan ex-servicemen, one of the latter, Mr 
Aelian Perera, had started a rival sale of Suriya flowers on this day, the proceeds of which were devoted to help needy Ceylonese ex-servicemen.


In 
1933 a British teacher 







Doreen Young






, wrote an article, The Battle of the Flowers which appeared in the Ceylon Daily News and exposed the absurdity of forcing Sri Lankan schoolchildren to purchase poppies to help British veterans at the expense of their own, which caused her to be vilified by her compatriots. 


The South Colombo Youth League now got involved in the Suriya Mal Movement and revived it on a new anti-imperialist and anti-war basis. Yearly until the 
Second World War, young men and women sold Suriya flowers on the streets on Armistice Day in competition with the Poppy sellers. The purchasers of the Suriya Mal were generally from the poorer sections of society and the funds collected were not large. But the movement provided a rallying point for the anti-imperialist minded youth of the time. An attempt was made by the British colonial authorities to curb the movement's effectiveness through the 'Street Collection Regulation Ordinance'.


Doreen Young was elected first President of the Suriya Mal Movement at a meeting held at the residence of 
Wilmot Perera in Horana. 
Terence de Zilva and 
Robin Ratnam were elected Joint Secretaries, and Roy de Mel Treasurer.




 Malaria Epidemic and floods 



There had been a drought in 
1934 which caused a shortage of rice, estimated at 3 million bushels. From October on there were floods, followed by a malaria epidemic in 1934-35, during which 1,000,000 people were affected and at least 125,000 died. The Suriya-Mal Movement was honed by volunteer work among the poor during the Malaria Epidemic and the floods. The volunteers found that there was widespread 
malnutrition, which was aggravated by the shortage of rice, and which reduced resistance to the disease. They helped fight the epidemic by making pills of '
Marmite' yeast extract. 
N.M. Perera became known as Parippu Mahathmaya ('Mr. 
Dhal') because of the lentils he distributed as dry rations to the people affected in those days.


As Sybil reminisced in Forward: The Progressive Weekly many years later: 'Work in connection with malaria relief was an eye-opener to many of these people who were just getting to know the peasant masses. The poverty was incredible, the overcrowding even more so, fifteen, twenty or more people crammed into tiny huts, dying like flies. This was what colonial exploitation meant: worse than the worst that prevailed in England when Marx and Engels analyzed the conditions of the working classes. This was what had to be fought.'

Commodore 64 software




Color64 is a computer 
BBS system that was very popular for the 
Commodore 64 during the 1980's. It was written by 
Greg Pfountz. Color64 was advanced for its time.  The I/O was all written in 
machine language.  It was also composed in modules, each written in basic.  Each module would be loaded into memory as a user went from one part of the system to another. For example, the login module was what handled the answering of the phone and the verification of login info.  It would then load the main menu module.  Going into the message boards would load the message board module. Online games worked the same way.

Because the 
Commodore 1541 and 
Commodore 1571 disk drives were slow, most BBSs would use memory expansion module. This would serve as a RAM disk and allow all modules to be loaded quickly.

2006-06-06; 1045 days ago


Apache License 2.0




The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) is a project sponsored by the 
Apache Foundation under their 
Jakarta charter to provide a simple API for decomposing, modifying, and recomposing binary 


Java

 classes (I.e. 
bytecode). The project was originally conceived and developed by Markus Dahm prior to officially being donated to the Apache Jakarta foundation on 27 October 2001. BCEL is Java-centric at present, and does not currently have a backend that exposes other bytecode implementations (such as .NET bytecode, 

Python
 bytecode, etc.).


Uses


BCEL provides a simple library that exposes the internal aggregate components of a given Java class through its API as object constructs (as opposed to the disassembly of the lower-level opcodes). These objects also expose operations for modifying the binary bytecode, as well as generating new bytecode (via injection of new code into the existing code, or through generation of new classes altogether.) The BCEL library has been used in several diverse applications, such as:



Java Bytecode Decompiling, Obfuscation, and Refactoring


Performance and Profiling


Instrumentation calls that capture performance meterics can be injected into Java class binaries to examine memory/coverage data. (For example, injecting instrumentation at entry/exit points.)


Implementation of New Language Semantics


For example, 
Aspect-Oriented additions to the Java language have been implemented by using BCEL to decompose class structures for point-cut identification, and then again when reconstituting the class by injecting aspect-related code back into the binary. (See: 
AspectJ)

A keyline irrigation channel



Keyline design is a technique for maximizing beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land, and the Keyline refers to a specific 
topographic feature linked to water flow.  Beyond that however, Keyline can be seen as a collection of design principles, techniques and systems for development of rural and urban landscapes.

Keyline design was developed in Australia by farmer and engineer 











P. A. Yeomans










, and described and explained in his books The Keyline Plan, Water For Every Farm and  The Challenge of Landscape. 


The basic idea behind Keyline is to examine the topography of the site identifying several features namely 
ridges and 
valleys and the natural water courses.
In a valley, a point called the Keypoint can be found where the lower and flatter portion of a primary valley suddenly steepens. A contour line   the Keyline   is formed by plotting all the points on the slope that are at the same elevation as the keypoint. Plowing parallel to the Keyline, both above and below will tend to drift rainwater away from the valley centre and prevent erosion. As opposed to 
contour plowing, this technique has the plow go up in the valleys and down along ridges which keeps rainfall up at the ridge tops longer, rather than allowing it to run down the slope into water courses, thus improving soil nutrition and health. In Australia, it is important to get the most from the scarce instances of rainfall. The Yeomans technique differs from traditional contour plowing in several important respects and the limitations of the traditional systems was an important motivational factor in the development of the system.















David Holmgren











, one of the founders of 














Permaculture













, used Yeoman's Keyline principle extensively in the formulation of Permaculture concepts and the design of sustainable human settlements and 
organic farms. A 
topographical example can be seen on (
37 09 33 S 144 15 08 E  /  -37.159154, 144.2522481). 


Keyline also includes concepts for rapid soil fertility enhancement and these concepts are explored in Priority One by P. A. Yeomans' son Allan. Yeomans and his sons were also instrumental in the design and production of special plows and cultivating equipment for use in conjunction with the keyline methodology.

Grizzlor




Grizzlor is a 
fictional character from the popular toy line 


Masters of the Universe

 by 

Mattel
.

A member of the 

Evil Horde
, Grizzlor is a hairy man-beast creature from the wild, covered in thick brown fur and sharp claws, who attacks his opponents with the power of brute strength. Most story media have portrayed him as a mindless brute with little in the way of intelligence.



Character Profile



Toy line/Mini-comics


Grizzlor is introduced into the Masters of the Universe toy line in 
1985 among the first wave of Evil Horde figures. His figure was packaged with the mini-comic  
Grizzlor: The Legend Comes Alive!   which portrays him as a kind of 
urban legend among the 

Eternia
ns, a product of apparent  tall tales  about a wild man-beast which roams the night stalking its prey. After 

Buzz-Off
 disturbs his Heroic comrades with tales of the creature, it later transpires that Grizzlor is a real creature and has been hired by 










Hordak









 to fight against 
He-Man and the Heroic Warriors. Grizzlor is portrayed as a mindless, savage killing machine, who is defeated by being shown his own reflection in a mirror; he apparently fears nothing but the sight of his own gruesome visage.


Grizzlor also appears in several of the Masters of the Universe comic series. A notable one of these are the UK comics published by London Editions, which portray him as one of the least intelligent of all the evil characters. In this series he is frequently used for comic relief and has a child-like mentality, implying he ias not actually evil and has merely been misled by Hordak into helping with his schemes. An origin story in a later issue explains that he comes from the 
jungle world of Jungulia  on the outer edge of the spiral arm of the N24 galaxy  and is a member of a race of man-beast creatures. Although his race was peaceful, by the age of 428 he had developed a savage anger that shocked his family, and stumbled across a range of powerful weapons in a cave. His youthful nature led him to see them as toys, and play with them as such. When detected with the weapons by 
















Horde Prime















's sata-spies, they mistook him for an evil warrior and reported him to 










Hordak









, who beamed him on board his ship, erasing all memories of Jungulia from his mind so he would willingly serve him. At first, upon seeing the advanced weapons, Hordak mistakenly believed Grizzlor must possess an incredible mental genius, but subsequently Grizzlor proved to have no remote intelligence, rendering Hordak confused as to why Horde Prime wanted him in the Horde.




She-Ra cartoon series


Grizzlor appears in animated form in the cartoon series , in which the Horde are the main villains. The cartoon series plays down his savagery, presumably to make his character more suitable for a children's audience. At times it even seems as though he may be more human than animal, particularly in the early episode  Beast Island  in which he is competent enough to operate a computer console and command a series of Destructotanks. However, he is far from intelligent and is usually portrayed as a generic bumbling villain, constantly fouling up Hordak's schemes. Although he appears frequently in the cartoon he has no spotlight roles and is mostly consigned to background appearances.




2002 series


Grizzlor also features in animated form in the updated Masters of the Universe cartoon series, produced in 2002 by 





Mike Young Productions




, to promote the relaunched toy line. Mattel had intended to release the Horde characters among the next wave of villains, and they were intended to fill the role of main opposition to He-Man in the show's third season. The second season episode  The Power of Grayskull  features the Horde in a flashback sequence, as an evil force from Ancient Eternia. Grizzlor was seen amongst Hordak, 

Leech
, and 

Mantenna
 in a non-speaking role, and was imprisoned by 













King Grayskull












 in the dimension of Despondos together with Hordak and the rest of the Horde. However, since the toy line and cartoon were cancelled shortly afterwards, the third season was never made. Despite the cancellation of the line, a Grizzlor mini statue figure has been sculpted and issued by toy sculptors the 
Four Horsemen.





Other media





 Grizzlor appears in the 

Robot Chicken
 episode  1987 , voiced by 


Seth MacFarlane

. He alongside 

Beast Man
 try to prevent Mo-Larr from reaching 
















Skeletor















, only for the Eternian Dentist to use a drill on Grizzlor's eye. 















Tom Root














 voices Grizzlor in the episode  Slaughterhouse on the Prairie  where he accompanies Mantenna into attacking the Whispering Woods and slaughtering the Twiggets only for She-Ra to stop them and Grizzlor ends up stuck underneath She-Ra's foot.

Religion in Malawi




Public Affairs Committee (PAC) was founded in 1992 by the religious community and other pressure groups in 
Mala i to enter into a dialogue with 
Kamuzu Banda's Presidential Committee on Dialogue in the transition period from the one-party to the multiparty system of government in Mala i. Most accounts of the transition credit PAC with a major role at this crucial point in the younger history of Mala i. 

After the referendum on multipartyism was won in 1993 and the first multiparty elections were scheduled to take place in 1994, a number of pressure groups (notably the 

United Democratic Front
 and the 

Alliance for Democracy
) split from PAC to form political parties to contest in the elections. PAC has since carried on as an umbrella organisation for the major faith communities represented in the country by the 
Muslim Association of Malawi, the 
Quadria Muslim Association of Malawi, the 
Malawi Council of Churches, the 
Evangelical Association of Malawi and the 
Episcopal Conference of Malawi . As such, it is the oldest and most well-known nongovernmental organisation in the country. PAC also is the national chapter of the 
World Conference on Religion and Peace (WCRP). The organisation s mission statement is  to mobilise the general public through the religious community and other stakeholders in promoting democracy, development, peace and unity through civic education, mediation and advocacy . After existing for over a decade, PAC has worked with a large number of partners (both local and international) in pursuance of this mission, and has put into practice a wide variety of activities.


The organisation has a national secretariat in 

Lilongwe
,  Mala i's capital city.

December 15, 
1921) was a 

German
 mathematician, and 
historian of science.  He is best known for his three-volume biography of 


Hermann von Helmholtz

, which remains the standard reference on the subject.

Konigsberger was born in 
Posen (now in 

Poland
), the son of a successful merchant.  He studied at the 
University of Berlin with 


Karl Weierstrass

.  He taught at the 

University of Greifswald
, the 

University of Heidelberg
, the 
Technische Universitat Dresden, and the 

University of Vienna
 before returning to Heidelberg in 1884, where remained until his retirement in 1914.  In 1919 he published his autobiography, 
Mein Leben (My Life). The biography of Helmholtz was published in 1902 and 1903.


Konigsberger's own research was primarily on 
elliptic functions and 
differential equations.  He worked closely with 

Lazarus Fuchs
, a childhood friend.

A pledge pin is a common custom of 








United States







 
fraternities and sororities in which a pin is worn by 
pledges for the duration of the pledging period, usually during all times not considered dangerous to do so (during 
sports, etc.). In the context of fraternities and sororities, the 
Phi Beta Kappa society founded on 
December 5th, 
1776 was the first .1 This organization's earliest emblem of recognition was a silver square medal with the initials S.P. and the date December 5th, 1776 engraved on the one side, with the 
Greek letters     (Phi Beta Kappa) engraved on the other side. This emblem from the first  American Greek  organization would be the first use of an emblem in identifying a member of the organization.


Exceptions



Some fraternities, such as 

Sigma Phi Epsilon
 and 

Lambda Chi Alpha
, no longer have a strict  pledging process;  rather they have  new membership  or  associate membership  levels. These new members are generally still endowed with a pin, though often referred to as  new member pins  instead of  pledge pins.

The Cornelia Street Cafe, in 

New York
's 









Greenwich Village








, first opened its doors in July of 1977. It quickly became a magnet for the artistic and highly creative folk who loved their art just off the beaten path. On any given night, one might hear writers, or poets, or musicians, spilling their musings to a standing room only crowd in the tiny cafe. Exotic and edgy art hung from the freshly painted white walls. The tables and chairs were wooden, and the coffee was stronger than the legs that held them up. A fine glass of wine could be savored along with an item chosen from the small but clever and delectable menu.

The 











Cornelia Street Cafe










 was also the birthplace of the Monday night songwriter's workshop started by singer/songwriter/and then cafe waitress 

Carolyne Mas
, in December of 1977. The group became known as The Songwriter's Exchange, and released an album on Stash Records in 1980. The one rule for the songwriters was that the song had to have been written   or at least heavily worked on   within the past week. The song was performed and then critiqued by fellow songwriters. The following week, the song was brought back in its improved-upon, and hopefully final stage. The cafe was a venue in which songwriters like 




Suzanne Vega



, the group's most famous alumna, perfected their craft, sometimes receiving private comments from other songwriters, but often just having a chance to watch reactions to the song in a supportive environment. The Songwriter's Exchange, over time and under the guidance of  









Jack Hardy








 eventually evolved into the 
cooperative that formed the 
Fast Folk Musical Magazine.


Other regular contributors to the workshop included

Robin Hirsch, a successful author himself, and who nurtured the cafe's artistic reputation over the past 31 years, is still one of the owners and continues to display a unique flair for finding and presenting the finest talent that New York City has to offer. Singer/songwriter/pianist 
Valerie Ghent now runs The Songwriter's Beat, the current incarnation of The Songwriter's Exchange.

2006.4


The primary purpose of the congestion tax is to reduce 
traffic congestion and improve the 
environmental situation in central Stockholm.4 The funds collected will be used for new road constructions in and around Stockholm.


A referendum was held in September 2006 a couple months after the end of the trial period. In the referendum the residents of Stockholm municipality voted yes and in 14 other municipalities voted no to implement it permanently. On 
October 1, 
2006, the leaders of the winning parties in the 

2006 general election
, declared they would implement the Stockholm congestion tax permanently.5 The 

parliament
 approved this on 
June 20, 
2007,6 and the congestion tax came into effect on August 1, 2007.23



Affected area


The congestion tax area encompasses essentially the entire 



Stockholm City Centre


, which includes 
Sodermalm, 
Norrmalm, 
Ostermalm, 
Vasastaden, 





Kungsholmen




, 





Stora Essingen




, 





Lilla Essingen




 and 
Djurgarden.7


There are unmanned electronic control points (in Swedish: betalstation, literally payment station)1 at all entrances to this area. The congestion tax is applied on both entry and exit of the affected area.7




Amount of tax to pay


The amount of tax payable depends on what time of the day a motorist enters or exits the congestion tax area. There is no charge on Saturdays, Sundays, 






public holidays





 or the day before public holidays, nor during nights (18:30   06:29), nor during the month of July.89 The maximum amount of tax per vehicle per day is 60 

SEK
 (6.34 
EUR, 9.85 

USD
).

Method of payment


Payment of the congestion tax cannot be made at the control points   they merely register which vehicles have passed them. A 



bill


 is sent to the vehicle owner at the end of each month, with the tax descisions for the preceding month's control point passages. The bill must be paid before the end of the next month. The vehicle owner is responsible for the payment of the tax, even if the bill does not arrive.12


The bill can be delivered in three different ways. By default delivery by mail to the vehicle owner's 
registered address, or opting for electronic delivery to the vehicle owner's 







Internet bank






, or opting for a 
direct debit arrangement called Autogiro13 which allows the tax to be automatically deducted from the vehicle owner's bank account when the bill is due.12


Failure to pay the tax within the allotted time results in a reminder bill being sent with an added 500 

SEK
 fee. If the tax along with the reminder fee is still unpaid within 30 days after the reminder bill was sent, the case will be forwarded to the 


Swedish Enforcement Administration

 which adds an additional fee of at least 600 SEK, and the vehicle owner will be noted in the Enforcement Register unless payment is made.14




 Tax deductibility 


The congestion tax is 
deductible for both private individuals and businesses. Private individuals may deduct the congestion tax for business journeys, and for traveling between the home and workplace according to the usual rules of car cost deduction (1:80 SEK/km), that is the distance is at least 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) and the time saved by traveling by own car compared to public transport is at least 2 hours per day.  Businesses may deduct all congestion tax expenses.15





 Exemptions from the congestion tax 



 Exempt vehicles 


Some classes of vehicles are exempt from the congestion tax:16



 Emergency services vehicles


 
Buses with a total weight of at least 14 
tonnes


 
Diplomatic corps registered vehicles


 
Motorcycles


 Foreign-registered vehicles


 Military vehicles


 Cars that according to the 

Swedish Road Administration
's vehicle registry are equipped for propulsion with entirely or partially with electricity, or other 
fuel gas than 
liquefied petroleum gas, or with a fuel mixture that predominantly consists of 
alcohol. This exemption is valid only until 
July 31, 



2012


.


 Cars with parking permit for disabled persons, after application to the 
Swedish National Tax Board.  This exemption is not valid if the car is used for professional purposes.






 Geographic exemptions 


As the island 
Lidingo has its only access to the mainland through the congestion tax affected area, all traffic to and from Lidingo to and from the rest of the 



Stockholm County


 is exempt from the tax, provided that one passes one of the 



Ropsten


 control points (located at Gasverksvagen, Lidingovagen, and Norra Hamnvagen) and some other control point within 30 minutes of each other.16


The 





Essingeleden




 motorway, part of 



European route E4


, that goes through the congestion tax affected area is also exempt, as it is the main route by-passing central Stockholm with no other viable alternatives present in the vicinity.  All exits and entrances of Essingeleden that are within the congestion tax area have control points placed at them.





 Technology 


The vehicles passing the control points are identified through 
automatic number plate recognition. The equipment, consisting of cameras, laser detectors, antennas, and information signs are mounted on a set of 




gantries



 at each control point.17
There are no payment booths at the control points, they are all unmanned and payment is done by other means later (see 
Method of payment above). At a traditional toll booth, a substantial percentage of the toll goes to costs for the staff, which is avoided here.


For those living on the island of 
Lidingo or otherwise often traveling there, an optional 
DSRC 
transponder can be used also to more accurately identify the vehicles, as an incorrect identification results in the Lidingo exemption rule not taking effect (see 
Geographic exemptions above). The DSRC transponders that were used during the congestion tax trial period are useless now and should be returned to the 

Swedish Road Administration
.18




History



Debate


The congestion tax was before its inception a highly debated proposition, especially in the peripheral parts of Stockholm county where residents who lived outside of the control points but worked in the city center argued that they should also have a say in whether the proposition was to be accepted. In the time since the control points were put in place, however, the debate has calmed down considerably as the system works smoothly and the actual cost of passing these stations is acceptable to most residents, as well as the fact that central Stockholm has been getting cleaner since the proposition went into action.
The debate has instead in many instances shifted toward the political reasons behind the proposition, where some argue that the proposition is simply a way to punish the residents of Stockholm for the centralized Swedish political system, which reportedly many people in rural parts of Sweden feel favours Stockholm above other regions.


Initially this was planned as a congestion 
fee, not a 
tax. But the 
Swedish government ruled that this kind of endeavor was considered a tax and not a fee, and thus this was made a governmental tax, not a local tax, as municipalities in Sweden are not allowed to create new taxes.




Trial period


A seven-month trial period of the congestion tax , called The Stockholm trials (Stockholmsforsoket)4, took place between 
January 3, 
2006 and 
July 31, 
2006. In addition to the optical recognition of license plates, 
DSRC transponders were used to identify vehicles, and opting to use one was a precondition for using direct debit for the payment of the tax.


The Road Administration have claimed that traffic passing in and out of the cordon reduced by between 20 and 25% during the period of the trial, and that air quality improved; after the trial, traffic volumes built up again. 96% complied with paying the tax on time, which raised 399 m SEK during the period19.

Referendum


Local consultative 
referendums regarding whether to permanently implement the congestion tax were held in 







Stockholm Municipality






 and several other municipalities in 



Stockholm County


 on 
September 17, 
2006.


It was only the referendum in Stockholm Municipality that the at the time reigning government would use as a basis for the decision. 
The municipalities surrounding Stockholm in 



Stockholm County


, especially those which are part of the 




Stockholm urban area



, showed discontent with the fact that the people of those municipalities get no say whether the congestion taxes will be implemented permanently. A substantial number of the inhabitants of the nearby municipalities travel to and from work through the congestion tax area. Therefore several of these municipalities decided also to have local referendums. A municipality is allowed to hold a consultative referendum at any time, but as the congestion tax had to be decided at the national parliament level it was unclear how the results would be interpreted if the government there changed after the 

2006 general election
 which was held the same day as these referendums were held.


The question asked on the ballots were in Stockholm (translated from Swedish): 
http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%A4ngselskatt_i_Stockholm#F.C3.B6rdelning_och_demokrati
Environmental fees/congestion tax means that fees will be charged in road traffic with the purpose to reduce queuing and improve the environment. The incomes will be returned to the Stockholm region for investments in public transport and roads.


In the other municipalities the question on the ballots were (translated from Swedish):
Do you believe that congestion tax should be permanently introduced in Stockholm ?

Interpretation of the results


Prior to, and a short while after, the election day it was not clear how big of an effect the results of the municipal referendums would have, especially for the referendums held in the municipalities other than Stockholm.


The 

Social Democratic
 government prior to the 

2006 general election
 (
cabinet Persson) stated that they would only take into consideration the results of the referendum held in Stockholm Municipality, while the opposition parties (



Alliance for Sweden


) stated that they would take into consideration the results of referendums the other municipalities as well if they won the election.


The opposition parties won the election and before they formed government (




cabinet Reinfeldt



)  their party leaders announced on 
October 1, 
2006 to implement the congestion tax permanently, and that the revenue would go entirely to new road constructions in and around Stockholm instead of entirely to 
public transport in Stockholm as it was during the trial period.5 The 

parliament
 approved the congestion tax on 
June 20, 
2007, for reintroduction on 
August 1, 2007.6






Criticism



Double-charging Essingeleden Bromma


Due to the asymmetric exit and entrance placement on the tax exempt 





Essingeleden




 motorway, southbound vehicles exiting from Essingeleden towards 
Bromma in the west, have to pass through two separate control points (No. 9 Lindhagensgatan Interchange and No. 8 Fredhall/Drottningholmsvagen Interchange),7 effectively doubling the charge.

 Any Way You Want It  is a popular song performed by 


Journey

 released on the album  

Departure
 as the opening track, and as a single in 
1980. The song is sung by 




Steve Perry



 and 

Neal Schon
 is the guitarist. It peaked at #23 at 
Billboard 100. With its catchy lyrics and rhythm (including Schon's 
guitar solo for the bridge), the song proved to be an instant classic and the band would indeed often play it to close their concerts. It appears on all three live albums released by Journey up to now (

Captured
, 

Greatest Hits Live
, ).



Genesis



According to cowriter 




Steve Perry



, the song was heavily influenced by Irish rock band 

Thin Lizzy
 and more particularly by bassist leader 




Phil Lynott



. In July 
1979, Journey was touring with Thin Lizzy across the 








United States







 when Lynott, Perry and Schon decided to share rhyme scheme exercises during a hanging out in 
Miami. The  basic  work on  the guitar-vocal-guitar-vocal interchange thing that happened between Phil and his lyrics and the guitarist and his arrangements, inspired the Any Way You Want It sorta give and take thing. It s guitar-voice, guitar-voice, more guitar-guitar-guitar-voice. It be voice-voice and back and forth and that s something that Neal and I think just instinctually picked up by hanging out with him 1 commented Perry. Schon and Perry would then rework on the song in the band bus, with Schon on acoustic guitar and Perry for vocals2.
Lynott's contribution was eventually quite decisive for Journey since it also influenced other songs built on the same scheme such as '

Stone In Love
'.


For the studio version, keyboardist 

Gregg Rolie
 originally used a 
mellotron but since it was defective, co-producer 
Geoff Workman decided to fix the sound by doubling it with Rolie's regular organ in the final mixing, creating then the unique sounding background support for the song.3




 In popular culture 






It was in an advertisement for Heinz Beans in the 1990s







In his book 

A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius
, 

Dave Eggers
 mentions the song in his list of symbolism, saying  Anyway You Want It is not a symbol, simply a great song. 







In the 1980 movie 

Caddyshack
, Al Czervik (

Rodney Dangerfield
) plays  Any Way You Want It  on the 
stereo on his 
golf bag while he waits for Judge Smails (

Ted Knight
) to play ahead of him on the golf course.







This reference was used again in the 
Simpsons episode  

Burns, Baby Burns
 , where 'Any Way You Want It' is played in the final scene as Dangerfield's character, Larry Burns, proclaims  Let's party,  and can be heard again briefly in the later episode  

Viva Ned Flanders
. 







In the 2003 movie , the song is playing during the ending credits while a switch between Drew, Cameron, and Lucy are washing a car and blooper reels are showing.








McDonalds used the song in their commercials for a period of time.








Ford used the song in a string of commercials that were ran in Fall 
2003.







In the skateboarding video Almost Round 3,  Any Way You Want It  was used as the music for the intro credits.







The song was featured in a 

Toyota
 and the Northland Ford commercial in the summer of 2003.











Rise Against


, a 

Chicago
 hardcore punk band, made a cover of the song on their 2003 album 
Revolutions Per Minute 







The song has strong social standing among teenagers, many regarding it as a classic song to dance to.







The band 
The Hammerheads remixed the song for the movie 

Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter
. The lyrics were changed to  Its Okay, Its Alright, Everybody gets laid tonight! 







Chuck, the 
nerd hero of the 

eponymous show
 which premiered on NBC in September 
2007, uses the song as a 
ringtone for his 
mobile phone in the pilot episode.







The song is a downloadable track for the video game  and is a playable track in 





Rock Band 2




.''






Other Songs






The Ramones also have a song called Any Way You Want It. However, it isn't a cover of the Journey song, but rather the Dave Clark Five song, which was also covered by KISS in 1977 for their second live album 

Alive II
.


Irish band  Dance to Tipperarry  did a cover of the song.

He made two more films with him and then moved to Mexico to participate in Los hijos que yo sone ( The sons I dreamed of ) and the telenovela San Martin de Porres that made him famous in this country. He made his last film in the Mexico/United States production The Bees and focused on working on telenovelas. In 1987 he wrote his first scripts for telenovelas for Como duele callar and the first story written for a young audience 
Quinceanera. Quinceanera was the telenovela of the year, it featured singer 
Thalia in one of the main roles and catapulted the career of 


Adela Noriega

 in her first starring role. In 1992 he wrote the script for De frente al sol, a telenovela starred by 
Angelica Aragon in the role of an indigenous woman and its sequel Mas alla del puente. In 1986 he adapted the script for Monte Calvario and in 1997 for its remake Te sigo amando. He took the role of Padre Murillo in both productions.


He died of cancer in May 2000 in Mexico City.


He has a look alike in the Philippines.

Mythology-based video games

Norse mythology in popular culture
1992 video games
Roguelikes






Not to be confused with the 
MMORPG 





Ragnarok Online




.





Title screen of Ragnarok.




Ragnarok is a 
freeware 
roguelike 
computer game for 

DOS
, created by Norsehelm Productions from 
1992 to 
1995, also going by the name Valhalla.  It is distinct from many other roguelikes in having a 
graphical interface, a historical/mythological setting, set quests, the ability to change classes, and the ability to permanently change one's race by polymorphing.



 Mythology 


Ragnarok is firmly set within the bounds of 
Norse mythology, with many of the gods, realms, items, and quests drawing directly from it.  A few of these present in the game are:





 



Thor


, god of thunder


 
Jormundgand, god, the world serpent


 

Loki
, god, mischievous troublemaker


 
Balder, fair god murdered by Loki


 

Hela
, god, queen of 

Niflheim



 
Mjollnir, Thor's hammer


 





Gungnir




, Odin's spear


 Mimming, 

Freyr
's sword


 Gjall, 



Heimdall


's Horn


 
Skidbladnir, a boat belonging to the gods


 
Ravens, benevolent monsters, messengers of Odin


 
Nidhogg, monster, a dragon-like being who chews on the roots of 





Yggdrasil







 
Dwarves, monsters, mythological smiths


 
Giants, monsters, 


Ymir

's kin


 

Midgard
, location, realm of men


 

Niflheim
, location, realm of the dead




However, other items and monsters are of a more  generic fantasy,  Japanese-inspired or Tolkienesque nature, such as orcs and katana.




 Character development 


Character development is one of the chief draws of Ragnarok. Throughout the game, the player may change forms, to obtain the powers and abilities of almost any monster in the game, with the exception of god and demi-god level creatures.  The player can also modify his own body, changing the number of fingers and eyes, and the gender of the character.  The player also has the option of changing his class every ten levels, and can gain powers, skills, abilities and permanent status effects.  Therefore, it is quite possible to begin the game as a male sage, and end the game as a 
lycanthropic female Fire Giant conjurer with 14 fingers, 3 eyes, and the ability to form giant paper whales using origami.


Some ways to develop your character are:





 Scroll of Knowledge, grants the player one active ability.







 Eating a dead body, there a many different creatures in the game and when killed and eaten give you a variety of different passive abilities. And in a few rare cases causes transformation.







 Wand of Polymorph, cast on yourself to transform yourself. Be warned however, the transformation is random and sometimes makes your situation worse. You can become any creature in the game, that includes weak monsters such as rats, who cannot carry a proper inventory or wield weaponry.







 Potion of Transformation, works just like the Wand of Polymorph but is made with the use of the Alchemy skill.







 Werewolves, pass on the curse of Lycanthropy when they attack you.






 Class system 



In the beginning of the game, the player must choose a 
character class.  These classes all have intrinsic statistics.  At level ten, the player  masters  a class, and gains all the skills that the class can use.  The player can then choose a new class, or continue as the old class for another ten levels.  There are six classes:





 
Viking - a physically strong character who gains the weaponmaster ability. Weapon mastery allows the player to do maximum damage with all weapons, and gives the player a free second turn from time to time.


 
Blacksmith - a physically powerful character who gains the ability to work metals into weapons and armor. The blacksmith is able to forge The Runesword, a powerful one of a kind weapon.


 
Woodsman - a moderately powerful character, who learns to make arrows from trees, to tame lesser (beast) monsters, to swim, and to terraform the terrain.


 
Conjurer - a physically weak character who learns to cast spells. In addition to using spells like the touch of death, the conjurer is able to teleport, and fuse staffs.


 
Alchemist - a physically weak character who learns to mix potions. A master alchemist is able to make the Potion of Second Life, which as the name suggests brings the player back to life as soon as he is killed.


 





Sage




 - a physically weak character who learns to write scrolls. A master sage can write a powerful one of a kind Switch Bodies scroll.




After the player has mastered every class, their class matters much less.  Initially, it is more important, since being a stronger fighter makes the beginning of the game easier, and some classes become powerful once mastered.




Ghosts


One element of Ragnarok gameplay is that slain player characters leave behind 'ghost data' for the next adventurer to encounter. This data includes the current adventurer's inventory (minus a few rare items) and the map state as it was at the time of death, including all opponents. From time to time such ghosts present a play challenge, such as might be the case in 'choke point' maps where a player cannot advance due to the large number of ghosts in the area.




Quests


The game consists of six quests based on Norse mythology.  They are:





 Free 
Balder's soul


 Locate and return 
Mjollnir to 



Thor





 Locate and return 

Gjall
 to 



Heimdall





 Locate and return Mimming to 

Freyr



 Locate and return 





Gungnir




 to 

Odin



 Find a manner for 
Tyr to fight with one arm

Miles: The New Miles Davis Quintet is an album recorded on 
15 November 
1955 by 





Miles Davis




, for 






Prestige Records





.  As the name suggests, it was the first to feature his now-famous  first great quintet  (though in fact they had recorded a session for 

Columbia Records
 three weeks earlier, eventually released on the album 

'Round About Midnight
).  The album is often known as Miles, since that is the only word on the cover.  As with the other albums recorded for Prestige the following year, the quintet was playing familiar material in a fairly straightforward manner.  Coltrane does not play on  There is No Greater Love .

Pop Up Canopies



Pop up canopies are portable shelters that collapse down to a size that is portable.   Typically canopies of this type come in varied sizes from 5'x5' to 10'x20'.

Most pop up canopies come in two pieces, the canopy frame and the canopy top. Canopy Frame are constructed of either 
Steel or 
Aluminum. Steel framed canopies are heavier and typically cost less than the superior aluminum frames.   


Top for most canopies are made from a 
Oxford polyester blend of fabric. This fabric is rated in denier. Any denier rating of 500 is acceptable and most rating above 500 will only increase weight and give no value to the fabric itself. Top are also fire retardant and water resistant. Due to seams sown into the top they will never be  water proof . Most companies offer a wide variety of colors for their tops.


Pop up canopies have become very popular for outdoor events and trade shows. Some commercial canopy companies are even beginning to silk screen and digitally print on the custom canopy tops to promote the company using them.


A straight leg canopy offers the same amount of square footage from the base of the legs to the top of the valance. A 10x10 canopy straight leg would offer 100 square feet (9.3 m2) of shade.  A slant leg canopy offer about 20 percent less square footage from the base of the legs to the top of the valance. A 10x10 slant leg would offer only 80 square feet (7.4 m2) of shade due to the angle of the legs.

Doges of Venice
Italian nobility
8th century births




Giovanni Galbaio was the eighth 









Doge of Venice








 (787 804) according to tradition, but only the sixth historically verifiable one. He succeeded his father 

Maurizio Galbaio
, who had associated him as doge in 778. The 
Byzantine emperor 

Leo IV the Khazar
 recognised his title in that year, though the attempt to set up a hereditary monarchy endangered Maurizio's own dogeship. 

Giovanni had been briefly held captive by the 


Lombard

 king 










Desiderius









 after a campaign in 


Istria

, but his father, through the pope, sent ambassadors to 

Charlemagne
, the 
king of the Franks, to petition for getting Giovanni's release. 


Upon his inheriting, without election, the full office of his father, he immediately began a vendetta against the 
patriarch of Grado, who represented the church and its opposition to the slave trade. Charlemagne, a dutiful son of the church and now king of Lombardy, supported the abolition of slavery in his domains and thus came to resent the Venetian commerce in the 
Adriatic. The patriarch, in the reign of Maurizio, had even instigated the expulsion and confiscation of goods of the Venetian merchants in the 
Pentapolis. Giovanni had the 
Empress Irene name his son 
Maurizio co-doge. 


Trying to counterinfluence the patriarch, Giovanni appointed his sixteen year-old nephew Christopher bishop of 
Olivolo. The patriarch refused to consecrate him, officially due his age, but actually because of his anti-Frankish stances. Maurizio II was sent to attack Grado with a flotilla of ships. There the elderly patriarch was thrown to his death from the tower. The opposition to the Galbaii family fled to Treviso while the nephew of the patriarch, 
Fortunatus, was elected in his stead and immediately fled to the Frankish court. The opposition crystallised under the leadership of one 

Obelerio degli Antenori
 and returned to Venice. Giovanni, with Maurizio and Christopher, fled to 
Mantua in 803, where they all probably died. Obelerio succeeded them.

Carving




Chalk carving is essentially 
carving in 
chalk. This article covers some methods, types of chalk, tools used and the benefits (and ramifications) of this material.

The benefits of this material are also its drawbacks. Its main benefit, its softness, makes it very easy to manipulate. This is also a serious disadvantage, however, as chalk structures tend to be very delicate. This material is also extremely brittle and dusty. However it is cheap, readily available, easy to work with the simplest of tools, and able to hold a reasonable amount of detail.


The main types of chalk, for the purposes of the carver, are processed and non-processed (natural). Processed chalk has several advantages over natural chalk; it is softer, more consistent and comes ready finished in neat cylinders of varying sizes. However, natural chalk is available in more interesting shapes, the size is not limited, and it holds detail better. 


Tools for chalk carving are numerous. In fact any small file, stone carving equipment (no mallet is needed), and even needles can be used. Some of the best hand carving equipment are an etching needle, a selection of small files, and a miniature carving tool designed for 
soapstone.


The methods are very simple. Once the carver has a feel for the material, it is possible to construct fairly complex shapes, and make figurative work. It is possible to coat the chalk in button polish to produce a finish. 


Chalk is considered by seasoned stone carvers as one of the most difficult of stones to shape, as the material may literally powder away in your hands, if you are not delicate with the handling.



 Types of Chalk Carving



There are two types of chalk carvings.


1. Using a single chalk
In this case we use a single chalk to carve an item. This can be face of a celebrity, tool, or other small object.


2. Using multiple chalks
Using multiple chalks we can create beautiful monuments. here are few examples

For information about the former cricketer born in 1963, see 

R. P. Singh (cricketer born 1963)
.

Rudra Pratap Singh  ( 


info


) (born 6 December, 1985 in 

Raebareli
, 

Uttar Pradesh
, India) is a left arm 
fast-medium bowler who has represented 
India in 
one day cricket and Test cricket.


R.P. Singh first came into contention during the under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2004, when he took eight wickets for a very impressive average of 24.75. He later performed consistently in the 




Ranji Trophy



 for Uttar Pradesh and impressive performances saw him earn a place in the 
ODI side in 2005. 


In his third one-day match, Singh got his first man of the match award as he played his part as India restricted Sri Lanka to a modest 196 all out. Swinging the ball on a batting wicket, he took 4 important wickets to rattle Sri Lanka. His bowling figures of 8.5 overs, 2 maidens, 35 runs and 4 wickets announced his arrival on the international stage.


Singh was selected to make his Test debut in the 2nd Test against 
Pakistan in 



Faisalabad


, 

Pakistan
 in January 2006. He won the man of the match award on his debut after taking 5 wickets in the match.


Singh's 4 wicket-haul in the fourth match of the 
one-day series against Pakistan in 2006, helped India take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series, and won him the man of the match award. India went on to win the series 4-1. In his first 11 ODI matches, he was awarded the man of the match award 3 times.


Singh was favoured to 






Sreesanth





 for the 
2006 ICC Champions Trophy due to his superior economy rate. However, he was unable to maintain his level of performance, and was dropped from the side.


In 2007 it was announced that Singh would be signing for 
English side 

Leicestershire
 as their second overseas signing. He was however unexpectedly recalled to the Indian side following their poor World Cup campaign and only made a handful of appearances.


Singh was included in the Test squad for the tour to England and has performed well, taking 5/59 at Lord's his first five-wicket-haul in Tests. In the one-day series he took seven wickets at 31.71 from five matches.


Singh was selected to play in the 

2007 ICC World Twenty20
 tournament in South Africa in September 2007. Singh emerged as the second-highest wicket-taker in the entire competition, taking 12 wickets in 7 matches at an average of 12.66 runs per wicket.  India won the 12-nation tournament after beating Pakistan in the final.  R.P. Singh's best figures were 4/13 in 4 overs in India's final Super-8 stage match in which they eliminated South Africa from the tournament.


Singh was then selected for India's one-day home series against Australia and Pakistan that followed, playing four games in each series and picking up a total of 11 wickets.

Reportedly, Singh has also hit  149kpmh. In home series against Australia in October 2007 he regularly bowled at late 140s and repeated his hostile spells in the home soil of Aussies.
However his last two tests against South Africa in his home soil was very dissapointing.

Hyacinthe-Louis De Quelen (
October 8, 
1778 - 
December 31, 
1839) was 
Archbishop of Paris. 



Biography


Born in 

Paris
, he was educated at the 
College of Navarre. Ordained in 1807, he served a year as Vicar-General of 






Saint-Brieuc





 and then became secretary to 










Cardinal Fesch









. When the latter was sent back to his diocese, de Quelen exercised the sacred ministry at 
St. Sulpice and in the military hospitals. Under the 
Restoration of 1814 he became successively spiritual director of the schools in the archdiocese, Vicar-General of Paris, and coadjutor archbishop to the Cardinal de Talleyrand-Perigord, succeeding the latter in 1821. 


The favours of 

Louis XVIII
 and  

Charles X
 did not make him subservient. As a 
peer of the realm he opposed, on behalf of the middle classes, the conversion of the national debt. At his reception into the 
French Academy he publicly lauded 
Chateaubriand, then in disgrace. While blessing the corner-stone of the 






Chapelle Expiatoire





 he demanded, though in vain, an amnesty for the exiled members of the Convention; and the ordinance of 1828, disbanding the 
Jesuits and limiting the recruiting of the clergy, was issued against his advice. 


Although de Quelen had not approved the royal ordinance of July 1830, which aimed at restoring absolute monarchy, he was nevertheless held in suspicion by the 
House of Orleans. On one occasion 


Louis-Philippe

 said to him:  Archbishop, remember that more than one mitre has been torn asunder .  Sire , replied the archbishop,  God protect the crown of the king, for many royal crowns too have been shattered . 


Apart from some official functions such as the christening of the 
Comte de Paris, the obsequies of the 
Duke of Orleans and the Te Deum sung in honour of the French victory in Africa, he confined himself to his episcopal duties, visiting the parishes of his jurisdiction, looking after the religious instruction of military recruits, and organizing the metropolitan clergy. In the outbreaks which followed the 








Revolution of 1830







 the archbishop was twice driven from his palace. However, when the epidemic of 1832 broke out, he transformed his seminaries into hospitals, personally ministered to the sick at the 
Hotel-Dieu, and founded at his own expense the  uvre des orphelins du cholera . 


He died shortly after, having the joy of witnessing the conversion of the apostate 
Bishop of Autun, the 
Prince de Talleyrand. 






Ravignan





 eulogized him at 






Notre-Dame





, and 
de Mole at the French Academy. From de Quelen's episcopate date the  Societe de St. Vincent de Paul , the  Conferences apologetiques de Notre-Dame  and several religious institutes, among which are the nursing Sisters of Bon-Secours. 




Legacy


Besides the eulogies on 


Louis XVI

 (Paris, 1816), on 
Madame Elizabeth (Paris, 1817), on the 


Duke de Berry

 (Paris, 1830), his  Discours de reception a l'academie francaise  (Paris, 1824), and some 120 pastoral letters, we have from his pen  Manuels pour l'administration des Sacrements de l'Eucharistie et de l'Extreme-Onction: du Bapteme des Enfants: du Mariage  (3 vols., Paris, 1837-38) collected in the  Rituel de Paris .

Manuel de Jesus Alexander (born

1971 in 
San Pedro de Macoris, 

Dominican Republic
) is a professional baseball 
infielder who is currently a 
free agent. He last played for the 








Columbus Clippers







, the Triple-A affiliate of the 



Washington Nationals


. He has played for the

 (

 (

Texas Rangers



 (
2004) and 


San Diego Padres

 (
2005-
2006). He bats and throws 
right-handed.



Baltimore Orioles


Alexander was signed as a 16-year-old amateur free agent by the 




Baltimore Orioles



 on 
February 4, 
1988.


Alexander made his big league debut with the Orioles at the age of 21 on 
September 18, 1992, during a 12-4 loss to the 




Milwaukee Brewers



. Alexander appeared as a defensive replacement for 
Cal Ripken Jr. in the bottom of the seventh inning and 
struck out in his only 
at bat of the game.




New York Mets


Alexander was traded by the Orioles along with 

Scott McClain
 to the New York Mets for 


Hector Ramirez

 on 
March 22, 1997. He appeared in many games that spring, 
hitting .248 with two 
home runs and 14 
RBI, 
stealing 11 bases in 11 attempts, in 54 games with the Mets before being named on 
August 14 as the player to be named later in an earlier trade. The Mets sent Alexander, 








Lance Johnson







, and 
Mark Clark to the Chicago Cubs for 








Brian McRae







, 









Mel Rojas








, and 









Turk Wendell








.




Chicago Cubs


Alexander hit .293 with a homer and seven RBI in 33 games with the Cubs in his six weeks with the team in 1997. In 
1998, he hit .227 in 108 games with Chicago, belting out a career-high five home runs. In 1999, Alexander appeared in 90 games with the Cubs and hit .271, the highest batting average of his career.


His relative success in the regular season did not translate to post-season glory as Alexander went 0-for-5 in two games during the 













1998 National League Division Series












 against the 










Atlanta Braves









.


The Cubs traded Alexander on 
December 12, 1999, to the Boston Red Sox for 
outfielder 








Damon Buford







.




Boston Red Sox


Alexander hit .211 with four home runs and 19 RBI in 101 games with the Red Sox in 2000, his lone season in Boston.


On 
June 30, 
2000, during a traffic stop, police discovered a bottle of anabolic 
steroids and two hypodermic needles in a 

Mercedes-Benz
 owned by Alexander that had been loaned to team bat boy Carlos Cowart, a high school student. Cowart was arrested for driving without a license and previous charges of driving without a license and failing to stop for police. Massachusetts State Police initially sought steroid possession charges against Alexander, but opted not to after the ballplayer's lawyers provided evidence that at least five people had access to the vehicle.1 Alexander's named appeared in the 
Mitchell Report, released on 
December 13, 
2007, as a result of the incident.




Texas Rangers


After the 2000 season and steroids incident, Alexander bounced around with minor league affiliates of the 


Seattle Mariners

, 




New York Yankees



, and 




Milwaukee Brewers



 - as well as a brief stint playing in Mexico - before being purchased by the Texas Rangers on 
March 24, 
2003. He spent the 
2003 season in the Rangers' minor league system before returning to the big leagues after a three-season absence in 2004. His return was brief, however, as Alexander appeared in 21 games with Texas, hitting .238 (5-for-21) with three RBI and a pair of 
doubles.




San Diego Padres


He started the 2005 season in the minor leagues before he was traded by the Rangers on 
August 31 to the San Diego Padres for minor leaguer 
Juan Jimenez.


Alexander appeared in 11 games with San Diego in 2005, hitting just .111 (2-for-18) with a double, playing each infield position at least once. He was released at the end of the season, but re-signed less than a month later.


In 2006, Alexander reported late to 
spring training with the Padres due to visa problems in the 

Dominican Republic
. Upon joining the team, he was optioned to San Diego's 
Triple-A affiliate, the 








Portland Beavers







. He split the 2006 season between Portland and San Diego, but was released by the Padres on 
October 12, 2006.2


In 2007, Alexander attended spring training with the Padres, but did not make the Major League club. Assigned to Triple-A Portland for the third straight season, he played just 7 games before being released.




Washington Nationals


He then signed a minor league deal with the 



Washington Nationals


 playing for their Triple-A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers. Alexander became a minor league free agent at the end of the season.


In an eleven-season career, Alexander has posted a .231 
batting average with 15 home runs and 115 RBI in 594 
games played with six teams.

The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs is a two-part 

BBC
 documentary, presented by 








Bill Oddie







, in which a group of scientists test out the strength of 
dinosaur weaponry using 
biomechanics. The first episode determines the winner of a battle between 
Tyrannosaurus and 
Triceratops, and second compares the strength of an 
ankylosaur and 
Velociraptor.

The programmes were broadcast on 
BBC 1 in August and September 2005.


In the US, The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs was known as Dinosaur Face-Off.



Episodes   Evidence


These are the episodes and the evidence revealed in them.



Tyrannosaurus VS Triceratops''



 Tyrannosaurus 





Evidence of head injuries on Triceratops indicates Tyrannosaurus attacked living Triceratops.


Using a steel Tyrannosaurus 
skull, scientists learned that Tyrannosaurus could easily crush a 
small 
car.


Scientists learn that Tyrannosaurus could run at a maximum of 25 mph.


Scanning an 
endocast from Tyrannosaurus's skull, scientists theorise that Tyrannosaurus had a brain similar to that of a modern-day 
alligator.


Tyrannosaurus had good 
vision, and a good sense of smell.


Tyrannosaurus could bite through bone, at a bite force of at least 4 tons per square inch.






 Triceratops 





Doing a 
crash test with an 
artificial Triceratops skull, made of resin, scientists learn that Triceratops probably didn't charge at predators, for its skull would likely break.


Triceratops may have gored its predators.


Triceratops was slower (15 mph) than  Tyrannosaurus, but more agile.






 Outcome 


An even match. In the episode, Triceratops managed to win the fight.





Velociraptor VS an unidentified 
ankylosaur



 
Velociraptor 





Velociraptor was only the size of a 
turkey.


 Velociraptor had 
feathers.


A 
robotic Velociraptor leg provides evidence that Velociraptor didn't 
disembowel its prey.


The fossil of a Velociraptor fighting a 
Protoceratops shows that the Velociraptor pierced the neck of its prey, possibly to stab the vital 
arteries or the 
jugular vein.


Velociraptor's wings were used for balance and agility, like an 
ostrich.


Along with its claws, Velociraptor's teeth were useful weapons.


Velociraptor most likely hunted in small packs.


Teeth of this dinosaur were found among its victims.


The biomechanical claw provides evidence that the Velociraptor couldn't penetrate the ankylosaur's 
armour, when tested on a 
crocodile 
skin, it would break.






Unidentified 
ankylosaur





Ankylosaur 
armour was similar to a crocodile's, though significantly harder.


Young crocodiles have no armour, especially on the neck. Baby 
ankylosaurs were probably similar.


A robotic ankylosaur tail shows that the tail club could break wood and bone with ease.


This dinosaur's armour and club was used only on more threatening predators than Velociraptor.


In the U.S version, it was known as the Ankylosaurus.






 Outcome 


The ankylosaur would win, although Velociraptor could easily kill young ankylosaurs.




 Minor Appearances 



 Tarbosaurus 













Tarbosaurus






 appears in the second episode briefly, fighting the ankylosaur, and losing.


It was related to Tyrannosaurus, and had almost the same 
bite force, which was still not enough to break the 
herbivore's armor.


The top 
predator in the 

Mongolia
n plains.






 Protoceratops 





Appears briefly in two fights against Velociraptor. The first is a re-enactment of the fighting dinosaurs scene. The second has it up against two Velociraptor and losing.


Its beak and bony head were powerful weapons, but because of its small size, 
Protoceratops was most likely preyed upon by many Mongolian predators.

This guide contains the monsters seen in  that were used by 






















Lothor





















 and his minions.

There were some monsters that look like they would be associated with some of Lothor's generals like they were in 

Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger
:





 If a monster would resemble an animal, they would be under Choobo's category.


 If a monster were robots, they would be under Zurgane's category.


 If a monster were body-part inspired, they would be under Shimazu's category.


 If a monster would resemble Phantom Beasts, they would be under Vexacus' category.




Anytime a monster appears defeated, Lothor or one of his other minions would send down a Scroll of Empowerment from his base to the Earth, which would then recreate the monster in gigantic form. It turned out that when a monster is destroyed, they end up in the Abyss of Evil waiting for it to be opened. In the final episode of the season,  Storm Before the Calm (Part 2),  where the abyss was finally opened, nearly every single one of these monsters makes a reappearance (Furthermore, while a few monsters were thrown back into the Abyss by the Rangers, most were not seen being returned, and the Abyss was not shown or said to have been re-sealed after Lothor and various minions of his broke free in  Thunder Storm.  Therefore, it is quite possible that every monster and general ever used in Power Rangers Ninja Storm is alive and free).

insect beast recruited by Motodrone (whom he also has a close resemblance to) and has the ability to make people face their worst fears by latching collars onto his victim's necks. Unlike most of Lothor's other monsters, Eyezak did not speak. Motodrone claimed, to Lothor, that Eyezak was the most terrifying monster in his(Lothor's) entire army. Eyezak even managed to swallow the Thunder Rangers, but they are rescued by the Blue and Yellow Rangers. It takes the power of the new Hurricane Megazord formation to finally destroy Eyezak. Eyezak does not fall under any of the villains' categories.


NOTE: In Ninpuu Sentai Hurricanger, this was the final form of Motodrone's Japanese equivalent. He was also not one of the monsters that appeared from the Abyss of Evil in  Storm Before the Calm .




Condortron





 First Appearance:  A Gem of a Day  (10/18/2003)




Condortron is a 
raven/
condor monster who was built and sent by Vexacus to attack the Rangers, and has the upper hand until the Green Ranger shows up. Condortron is destroyed by the Hurricane Megazord. Fits the category of Vexacus' monsters, since he was summoned from Vexacus fan.




 Catatonia 





 First Appearance:  Storm Before the Calm, Part 2  (11/15/2003)




 Catatonia  was an 
ocelot-themed Evil Space Ninja that appeared when the Abyss of Evil was opened in 2003. She was defeated by the Ninja Storm Rangers. Fits the category of Vexacus' monsters.




 Chin Dragon 





 First Appearance:  Storm Before the Calm, Part 2  (11/15/2003)




This 



Chinese dragon


 monster appeared when the Abyss of Evil was opened in 2003. He was defeated by the Ninja Storm Rangers. Chin Dragon also returned in  as one of the monsters in Lothor and Mesogog's army although he wasn't seen guarding the Samurai Amulet with Zurgane and the other monsters. Fits the category of Vexacus' monsters.





Zords/Giant Robots


During the course of the series, Zurgane built his own zords to battle the Rangers. Near the end of the series Marah, Kapri and Shimazu piloted their own zords.



ZurganeZords





 First Appearance: ZurganeZord #1:  Thunder Strangers, Part 3  (3/22/2003), ZurganeZord #2:  Shane's Karma, Part 1  (8/9/2003), ZurganeZord #3:  General Deception, Part 1  (10/4/2003), Hyper ZurganeZord:  General Deception, Part 2  (10/4/2003)







ZurganeZord #1: The first of Zurgane's Zords was a green-colored mecha that appeared in  Thunder Strangers, Part 3 . It was a tough opponent but the Rangers managed to destroy it by combining the Lion Laser and the Squid Drill.







ZurganeZord #2: Zurgane's second zord was a red-colored, upgraded version of his first Zurganezord that appeared in  Shane's Karma, Part 1 . This form even had is own version of the Storm Megazord's Lightning Mode. It was used to distract the Rangers while Lothor dealt with Vexacus and Shane. This Zord was significantly stronger than the first Zurganezord and it required the Thunderstorm Megazord to destroy.







ZurganeZord #3: Zurgane's third zord was a blue-colored version of his previous models. This zord's true purpose was to scan the Rangers' Megazords' powers so that the Hyper Zurganezord could use the data to adapt. It was easily destroyed by the Hurricane Megazord.







Hyper ZurganeZord: The Hyper Zurganezord was a blue and silver mecha, the culmination of the data that Zurgane collected from his previous battle with the Rangers and was the last of Zurgane's zords. It had a significantly different design to the other ZurganeZords and had a more humanoid shape. With the data that Zurgane collected it was adapted to the Rangers' weapons and had its own Power Sphere, the Hyper Sword and was so powerful that it bested the other Rangers' Zords. It wasn't until the Rangers used a completely new Zord formation, combining the Hurricane Megazord, the Mighty Mammoth Zord and all of the Rangers' Power Spheres, were they able to finally destroy the Hyper ZurganeZord.






Marah, Kapri and Shimazu's Zords





First Appearance:  Down and Dirty  (10/18/2003)




In  Down and Dirty , Marah and Kapri recruited Shimazu in a fake scheme to overthrow Lothor and threatened to turn him over to Vexacus (who was scheming to destroy Shimazu at that point as well). All three of them piloted their own Zords against the Power Rangers. Kapri was the first to appear, hers was a modified, feminine version of the Lightning Mode of Zurgane's second zord. Later in the battle Marah and Shimazu ambushed the Rangers. Marah's zord resembled a giant, recolored version of Beevil while Shimazu's zord resembled a giant, robotic 
flying squirrel. The Rangers were able to destroy Marah and Shimazu's Zords simultaneously, then destroyed Kapri's Zord by combining the Mammoth Zord and Power Spheres with the Hurricane Megazord.




Lothor Zord





First Appearance:  Storm Before the Calm, Part 2  (11/15/2003)




Lothor piloted his own zord during the Season Finale. It resembled a 
demonic, humanoid 
centipede that wielded a 
crossbow-like weapon. Lothor used it, along with the Samurai Amulet to open the Abyss of Evil. It fought against the Storm Megazord but was destroyed, but managed to destroy the Storm Megazord along with it.


NOTE: Lothor's Zord is based on Hurricanegers' main villain, Tau Zanto, in his second form.

An elaborate sand sculpture.




A 
sand castle is a type of sand sculpture which resembles a miniature 
building, often (but not always) a 
castle. The two basic building ingredients, 
sand and 
water, are available in abundance on a sandy 
beach. A variant on the sand castle is the drip castle, made by mixing extra water in with the sand, and dripping this wet sand from a fist held above. When the slurry of sand and water lands on existing sand structures, the water is rapidly wicked away leaving the blob of sand in place. The effect is 
Gaudi-esque. Although sand castles are typically made by children, simply for the fun of making them, sand sculpture is also a form of art. Sand art can be large and/or complex, such as the sophisticated 
mandala in 
Buddhist art. 
Ice and 
snow are also utilised for art in the form of 
ice sculptures and 
snow sculptures.

Essays in London and Elsewhere is a book of 
literary criticism by 



Henry James


 published in 
1893. The book collected essays that James had written over the preceding several years on a wide range of writers including 

James Russell Lowell
, 



Gustave Flaubert


, 

Robert Browning
 and 





Henrik Ibsen




. The book also included an interesting general essay on the role of the 
critic in 
literature and a piece of 
travel writing about 

London
.


Summary and themes


James wrote many of these essays while he was busy with his ultimately disastrous effort to become a successful playwright. So it's not surprising that two of the essays deal with the 
theater. One of them is a graceful eulogy for his friend, the great actress 
Frances Anne Kemble, with  her fine, anxious humanity, the generosity of her sympathies, and the grand line and mass of her personality.  The other is a surprisingly emphatic defense of Henrik Ibsen, whose work caused 

London
 audiences to  sweep the whole keyboard of emotion, from frantic enjoyment to ineffable disgust. 


James shows his usual interest in French writers with three essays including a perceptive appreciation of 











Pierre Loti










, who  speaks better than anything else of the ocean, the thing in the world that, after the human race, has most intensity and variety of life.  James also writes generously of his old friend James Russell Lowell:  He had his trammels and his sorrows, but he drank deep of the tonic draught, and he will long count as an erect fighting figure on the side of optimism and beauty. 


The book closes with an amusing dialogue called An Animated Conversation. The characters talk long and wittily of the literary relationship between 











Britain










 and 








America







. The wisest speaker finally concludes: 




 A body of English people crossed the 
Atlantic and sat down in a new climate on a new soil, amid new circumstances. It was a new heaven and a new earth. They invented new institutions, they encountered different needs. They developed a particular physique, as people do in a particular medium, and they began to speak in a new voice. They went in for 
democracy, and that alone would affect--it has affected--the tone immensely. C'est bien le moins (do you follow?) that that tone should have had its range and that the 
language they brought over with them should have become different to express different things. A language is a very sensitive organism. It must be convenient--it must be handy. It serves, it obeys, it accommodates itself.

Critical evaluation


James' ability to understand and appreciate writers very different from himself shines through this book's essays on Ibsen and Loti. He brings to each a deep appreciation of their outlook on life and their harsh but effective techniques for presenting it. James is never afraid to point out what he considers faults or omissions in the writers he discusses. But his criticism is never captious, never a wish that a writer was somebody he is not.


The essay on Ibsen has biographical relevance and even poignance for James, who would experience a very public failure in the theater just a few years after this book was published. The respect James pays to the renowned playwright betrays how much he wanted to succeed in the theater himself, and how bitter his eventual defeat would be.

Bagramyan in 1938







Hovhannes Bagramyan
 was a 



Soviet


 
Armenian military commander and 







Marshal of the Soviet Union






. During 







World War II






, Bagramyan became the first non-
Slavic military officer to become a commander of a 








Front







. Bagramyan's previous experience in military planning as a chief of staff officer allowed him to distinguish himself as a capable commander during the war in the early stages of the Soviet counter-offensives against 

Nazi Germany
. He was given his first command of a unit in 1942 and in November 1943, received his most prestigious command as the head of the 
First Baltic Front. As head of the Baltic Front, he participated in the offensives which moved westwards to push 

German forces
 out of the occupied Soviet Union and 
the recapturing of the 
Baltic republics. After the war, he served as a deputy member of the 





Supreme Soviet




s of the 
Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic and 
Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and was a regular attendant of the 










Party Congresses









. In 1952, he became a candidate for entry into the 
Central Committee and, in 1961, was inducted as a full member. For his contributions during the war, he was widely regarded as a national hero in the Soviet Union, and continues to hold such esteemed status among many Armenians today.

History of New Jersey
Official documents




Concession and Agreement was a document that provided 
religious freedom in the colony of 

New Jersey
. It was issued as a proclamation for the structure of the government for the colony written in 
1665 by the two proprietors, Lord 
John Berkeley and Sir 
George Carteret. 

The document promised religious freedom to all inhabitants of New Jersey, and also declared that the proprietors would be in charge of appointing the 
New Jersey governors. The first such governor to appointed was 






Philip Carteret





. 


The goal of the document was to entice more settlers to farm in New Jersey, so that the two proprietors could earn more profit by collecting 
quitrents, annual fees paid on granted lands. To encourage such settlement, they allowed religious freedom, which was not available underneath the English government.

In the 
sport of 
cricket, side on describes the position of a 
bowler or 
batsman.



Side on bowling


A side on bowler has chest and hips aligned at ninety degrees to the batsman at the instant of 
back foot contact. Australian pace bowler 


Dennis Lillee

 used a side on technique to great effect.




Side on batting


A batsman is side on when imaginary lines through hips and shoulders point towards the bowler. Most shots, such as forward defence, backward defence and front and back foot drives, are taught with a side on technique. The combination of a side on technique and hands staying close to the line of the body allow the bat to travel in a simple arc from the top of the backlift, through the point of contact and on to the follow through. The motion and timing of the movement of the joints becomes more complex if the hips or shoulders rotate into a 
chest on position.


A side on batting 
stance is also known as a  closed  stance.

Sephirot (Kabbalah)

:See also 
Tree of life (disambiguation) for other meanings of the term.


The Tree of Life, or Etz haChayim (        ) in Hebrew, is a mystical symbol within the 
Kabbalah of esoteric 
Judaism used to describe the path to 
God1 and the manner in which He created the world 
ex nihilo (out of nothing). The Kabbalists developed this concept into a full model of reality, using the tree to depict a  map  of 






creation





. The tree of life has been called the  
cosmology  of the Kabbalah.


Some believe the Tree of Life of the Kabbalah corresponds to the 
Tree of Life mentioned in 
Genesis 2:9. 


This mystical concept was later adopted by some esoterically inclined 
Christians as well as 
Hermeticists.







 The 
Sefirot in 
Jewish Kabbalah















Sephiroth






The Tree Of Life is a diagram representative of the process by which Kabbalists believe the universe came into being. On the Tree of Life the beginning of the universe is placed at a space above the first Sephiroth, or Kether, which means the Crown in English. It is not always pictured in reproductions of the Tree of Life, but is referred to universally as Ain Soph Aur (Ain - Nothing, Soph - Limitless, Aur - Light).  To the Kabbalists, it symbolises that point beyond which our comprehension about the origins of Being cannot go any further; it is considered to be an infinite nothingness out of which the first 'thing' (thought of in science and the Kabbalah to be energy) exploded to create a universe of multiple things. 2 3 Kabbalists also do not envision time and space as pre-existing and place them at the next three stages on the Tree of Life. First is Kether, or the Crown in English, which is thought of as the product of the contraction of Ain Soph Aur into a singularity of infinite energy or limitless light. In the Kabbalah, it is the primordial energy out of which all things are created. The next stage is Chokmah, or Wisdom, which is considered to be a stage at which the infinitely hot and contracted singularity expanded forth into space and time. It is often thought of as pure dynamic energy of an infinite intensity forever propelled forth at a speed faster than light.  It is considered to be the primordial masculine energy, which is also referred to in Chinese 
Taoist philosophy as Yang. Next comes Binah, or Understanding, which is thought of as the primordial feminine energy, the Supernal Mother of the universe which receives the energy of Chokmah, cooling and nourishing it into the multitudinous forms present throughout the whole cosmos. 4It is also seen as the beginning of Time itself. It is analogous to the Chinese concept of Yin which together with Yang are considered to be the basis of all of creation. There are many parallels between 
Taoist philosophy and the Kabbalistic conceptions of the Tree of Life. 5 


Numbers are very important to Kabbalists and the Hebrew letters of the alphabet also have a numerical value for the Kabbalists. Each stage of the emanation of the universe on the Tree of Life is numbered meaningfully from one, or the 
Sephiroth of Kether to ten, or the Sephiroth of Malkuth.  The nature of each number is thought to express the nature of its Sephiroth. 6


The first three Sephiroth, called the Supernal Sephiroth, are considered to be the primordial energies of the universe.  The next stages of evolution on the Tree of Life are considered to exist beyond a space on the tree, between the Supernals and the other Sephiroth, called the Abyss, because their levels of being are so distinct from each other that they appear to exist in two totally different realities.  The Supernal Sephiroth exist on a plane of divine energy.  This is why another correspondence for Binah is the idea of suffering, because the Supernal Maternal energy gives birth to a world that is inherently excluded from that Divine Union. After Binah the universe gets down to the business of building the materials it will need to fulfill its evolution and creating new combinations of those materials until is so dense that by the stage of Malkuth the initial pure limitless energy has 'solidified' into the physical universe.  Since its energies are the basis of all creation the Tree of Life can potentially be applied to any area of life, especially the inner world of man, from the subconscious all the way to what Kabbalists call the higher self.


But the Tree of Life does not only speak of the origins of the physical universe out of the unimaginable, but also of man's place in the universe.  Since man is invested with Mind, consciousness in the Kabbalah is thought of as the fruit of the physical world, through whom the original infinite energy can experience and express itself as a finite entity.  After the energy of creation has condensed into matter it is thought to reverse its course back up the Tree until it is once again united with its true nature.  Thus the Kabbalist seeks to know himself and the universe as an expression of God, and to make the journey of Return by stages charted by the Sephiroth, until he has come to the realisation he sought.



Similarities


The Treejjjj of Life bears many similarities to the 
Christian 
Gnostic conception of the 
Pleroma, emanations from the ineffable and self-originating Divine Parent that offer the best possible means of describing 
God. Each emanation in the 
Pleroma is born from a more complex emanation before it. Most notably between these two allegories is the final 
Sephirah on the Tree,  
Malkuth, and the last emanation in the 
Pleroma, 
Sophia, whose fall from grace resulted in the physical world.

August 22, 2005




This article is about the Atlantic tropical storm of 2005. For other uses, see 
Hurricane Jose.

Tropical Storm Jose was a short-lived 
tropical storm which made 
landfall in central 








Mexico







 during August 2005. Jose was the tenth named storm of the 

2005 Atlantic hurricane season
 and the fourth of six 
tropical cyclones (three hurricanes and three tropical storms) to make landfall in Mexico in that year.


Tropical Storm Jose formed in the 


Bay of Campeche

 on August 22 and made landfall in the Mexican state of 

Veracruz
 the next day. It retained tropical characteristics for less than one day before dissipating, but still brought heavy levels of rainfall to the region. Mudslides caused by the rainfall killed eight people, six of those directly, and caused $45 million (2005 
USD) in damage.1 



Meteorological history





Storm path



On August 17 a 
tropical wave, probably the same wave from which 
Tropical Depression Ten had developed from earlier in the month, began to 
organize in the central 





Caribbean




. 
Convection gradually increased as it moved towards the 
Yucatan Peninsula, but the system did not develop beyond a tropical wave. The system weakened as it crossed the peninsula, and when it entered the 


Bay of Campeche

 on August 21 it had hardly any convection remaining. However, early in the morning of August 22, convection rapidly increased under highly favorable upper-level conditions, and the system became Tropical Depression Eleven about 110 miles (175 km) east of 
Veracruz.2


The depression rapidly intensified as it moved to the west, becoming Tropical Storm Jose just six hours later. The 
global model guidance initially failed to resolve the storm's track well, with some models indicating that it would stall offshore.3 Jose continued to strengthen as it moved towards the coast and made landfall in the state of 

Veracruz
 early on August 23 with winds reaching a peak of 60 mph (90 km/h).2 As Jose made its landfall an 
eye was beginning to form, although the storm was still well short of 
hurricane intensity.4


Tropical Storm Jose quickly weakened after 
landfall and dissipated that afternoon in the mountains of central Mexico only 24 hours after forming.2




Preparations


As Tropical Storm Jose formed so close to shore there was a lead time of less than 9 hours on the 
tropical storm warning for the 

Veracruz
 coastline. The area covered by the warning issued on September 22 was extended southwards as Jose intensified, before being canceled soon after landfall on September 23. The advisories issued by the 














National Hurricane Center













 emphasized that rainfall from Jose was the primary threat.2

Tropical Storm Jose was responsible for damaging 
crops, 
highways and 
homes; flooding districts in several cities in the state of 

Veracruz
, and the evacuation of 80,000 people to 
shelters. The government of that state estimated the damages caused by the storm to be approximately $45 million (2005 
USD). Approximately 120 municipalities were affected by the torrential rain, but the majority of the damage was concentrated to eight of them: 
Martinez de la Torre, 
Misantla, 

Nautla
, 
San Rafael, 
Vega de la Torre, 
Actopan, 
Cardel and 
Ursulo Galvan. Damage to the highway infrastructure was estimated at $33 million (2005 USD).1


It was also reported that the storm damaged at least 16,000 homes and about 250 
square kilometers (60 thousand 
acres) of land used for 
cattle. In addition over 420 square kilometers (103 thousand acres) of various crops, including 
sugar cane, 
corn and 
bananas, were flooded. Many boats were also lost as a result of Jose. 90 active medical brigades were sent to the region to reduce the risk of 
infections amongst the affected population.1


Jose was responsible for six direct casualties. One of these deaths was the result of a mud slide that killed a man was in 

Xalapa, Veracruz
. The other five deaths were also due to mudslides in 

Oaxaca
.2




Naming and records


When Tropical Storm Jose formed on August 22, it was the earliest date for the formation of the tenth tropical storm in an Atlantic hurricane season, beating the previous record held by Tropical Storm Jerry of the 

1995 season
 by 1 day. This was also the third time the name  Jose  had been used to name a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic. As Tropical Storm Jose did not have a major impact, the name was not retired by the 






World Meteorological Organization





 and will be on the list of names for the 2011 season.

Scientific terminology





Organic describes forms, methods and patterns found in living systems such as the organisation of 
cells, to 
populations, 
communities, and 
ecosystems. 


Typically organic models stress the interdependence of the component parts, as well as their differentiation. Other properties of organic models include:



the growth, life or development cycle


the ability to adapt, learn, and evolve



emergent behaviour or 
emergent properties


steady change or growth, as opposed to instant change


regulatory feedback


composed of heterogeneous (diverse) parts




Organic models are used especially in the design of artificial systems, and the description of social systems and constructs.



Uses



In the social sciences, the organic model has been drawn upon for ideas such as 
organic solidarity, 
organic society and 
organic unity. 





Carl Ritter




 forwarded the idea of 
Lebensraum through the concept of an organic, growing 
state. 


In 
computer science, organic networks grow in an ad hoc manner, while 
organic computing is 
autonomous and able to self-organise and 
heal. 



Bionics (biomimicry) is the engineering of technology through the use of systems found in 
biology.



Organic architecture stresses interrelatedness as it the combines the site, buildings, furnishings, and surroundings into a unified whole, each adapted to the others. Examples include the use of 
passive solar and wind energy as elements of design so that the building can be easily adapted to maintain the desired levels of human comfort within the structure.


In economics and business, 
organic growth refers to market growth that has happened gradually, and not through a sudden buyout or acquisition. An 
organic organisation is one which is flexible and has a flat structure, or one of minimal height.


In military, 
organic refers to mixtures of 
military unit types.

Harry Cassidy (1900 - 1951) was a 

Canadian
 academic, social reformer, civil servant and, briefly, a politician.

Cassidy was a pioneer in the field of social work. He was the founding dean of the School of Social Welfare at University of California, Berkeley in the early 1940s before resigning to work for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. He subsequently became dean of the School of Social Work at the 

University of Toronto
. 


In the 1930s he was involved with the 


League for Social Reconstruction

 and was a founding member of the 

Co-operative Commonwealth Federation
, however, in 1950 he ran for the leadership of the 

Ontario Liberal Party
 coming in second in the 
party leadership convention. 


Cassidy conducted studies of welfare services beginning in the 1930s and 1940s and influenced the creation of a Canadian  
welfare state and improved social services as a means of improving society and alleviating poverty. During the 





Great Depression




 he argued that the government of 
R.B. Bennett should create a broad system of social services such as Unemployment Insurance as a shock absorber against poverty. His research influenced Bennett's decision to try to emulate 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 
New Deal and some of his ideas were ultimately taken up by the 

Liberal
 government of 


William Lyon Mackenzie King

 in the 1940s, particularly after Cassidy published his 1943 study Social Security and Reconstruction in Canada. He continued to criticize Canada's social security system as inadequate, writing in 1947 that   The provisions for general assistance are limited, restrictive, mean, and antiquated ... .[T]hey are literally disgraceful and unworthy of a nation of Canada's status . 


He also worked for a period in the civil service as deputy minister of welfare in 

British Columbia
.

physicist. He was known in 










the West









 as Georg Rumer.


He spent some years in 
Gottingen (

Germany
) during the 1930s and had contacts with many of the prominent physicists and 
mathematicians of that time, including 


Einstein

, 


Hilbert

, 


Born

, 


von Neumann

, 

Landau
, and 

Gamow
.


Most notably, in 1932, Rumer wrote   in conjunction with

Valence bond theory, which is a 
quantum explanation of the 
chemical bond in 
molecules.


Later, Rumer was 
imprisoned then 
exiled during 
Stalin's regime. While in exile, he worked on Einstein's 
Unified Field Theory.

Elaine Lee (born 1937 in 

South Africa
) is an 

Australia
-based theatre and 
television actor best known for her long-running role in the 1970s television 
soap opera 

Number 96
. 

Her acting career began in the 1960s in South Africa where she acted extensively in the theatre and on 
radio. Emigrated to Australia in 1970 and became well-known playing the purpetually unlucky-in-love Vera Collins in Number 96 starting 1972. Lee was an original cast member of the serial and the sophisticated Vera emerged as a key character in many of its storylines. Vera suffered several failed love affairs and was raped three times as the story progressed - including once in the feature film version of the serial released in 1974 - and was occasionally seen semi-nude in the series. Lee's then husband, South African-born actor 







Garth Meade






, also had a brief role in Number 96.


Elaine Lee remained in the role of Vera for four and a half years, finally leaving in mid 1976 of her own volition. A few months later the producers of the show briefly returned her to the series as part of an attempt to launch a 
situation comedy spin-off following the further adventures of Vera Collins away from Number 96, however this series never eventuated. Soon afterwards Lee played the regular role of the senior mistress in school-based drama series 












Glenview High











 (1977) however the series was not a major success and was not renewed beyond its single season.




She subsequently appeared in several productions of the 

Australian Broadcasting Corporation
, in 
TV movies and panel shows, and made guest appearances in drama series such as 

A Country Practice
. She also continued her stage work, including the challenging one-woman show Turn on the Heat, loosely based on the last two hours of 



Marilyn Monroe


's life.


She made sporadic appearances in Australian feature films during the 1990s, in 1997 played a regular role in critically panned situation comedy series 
Bullpitt, and had a recurring role in series 




























Heartbreak High



























. In the 2000s Lee has continued to make occasional guest appearances in Australian films and drama series, and opened an acting school in Sydney with fellow thespian 






Judi Farr





. In 2005 she acted in soap opera 
Home and Away. She also presents a commentary on the 2006 DVD release of the Number 96 feature film.

Meat
Cooking




For other uses, see 
Temperature (disambiguation).
 Medium rare  redirects here. For the album by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, see 

Medium Rare (album)
.

Temperature, or doneness, is a description of how thoroughly cooked a cut of meat is based on the color, juiciness and internal temperature when served. The gradations of cooking are most often used in reference to 
beef (especially 
steak) but are also applicable to 
lamb, 
pork, 
poultry, 
veal, and sometimes 
fish.


The gradations in common use in most English-speaking countries are specified in the  Traditional  column below.  See below the table for details of the 
USDA recommendation.




Term

Description

Traditional temperature range


USDA recommendation



Raw

not cooked at all; thoroughly red/bloody inside

115 F

46 C

Room temperature



Very rare/ Blue

very red and cold ( blue rare )

115 125 F

46 52 C




Rare

a cool red center; pink otherwise

125 130 F

52 55 C




Medium rare

a warm red center, otherwise pink

130 140 F

55 60 C

145-150 F



Medium

warm pink center, otherwise brown

140 150 F

60 65 C

150-165 F



Medium well

mostly brown with a gray center, very little if any pink

150 160 F

65 71 C

165-170 F



Well done

Brown throughout with no sign of pink

 gt;160 F

 gt;71 C

 gt;170 F





As meat is cooked, it turns from red to pink to brown to black (if burnt), and the amount of 
myoglobin (not blood) and other juices decreases. Well done cuts are drier and contain little or no juices. 


The interior of a cut of meat may still increase in temperature 5 10 F (3 5 C) after being removed from the 




grill



 or 
oven, and the meat is therefore allowed to  rest  before being served, which allows its temperature to stabilize. This is caused when the hot exterior continues to cook the comparatively cool inside- in short, heat moves from the hot exterior into the cooler interior. The temperatures indicated above are for when the meat should be removed from the heat source, not its ultimate desired temperature.


The 
USDA 
recommends a temperature of at least 145 F (63 C) for beef, veal, and lamb steaks and roasts, or fish to prevent 
foodborne illness.  Other meats require higher temperatures; see 
Critical Control Point.

Charles Hesterman Merz (
5 October 
1874 - 14 or 
15 October 
1940) was a British 
electrical engineer who pioneered the use of high-voltage 
three-phase 
AC power distribution in the United Kingdom, building a system in the North East of England in the early 20th century that became the model for the country's 
National Grid.


Life


Merz was born in 

Newcastle upon Tyne
 and attended Armstrong College in the town. He then entered an apprenticeship at the 
Newcastle Electric Supply Company (NESCo), which had been founded by his father, the industrial chemist 

John Theodore Merz
, in 1889.  In 1899 he set up a consulting firm which, with the arrival of 




William McLellan



 in 1902, became 


Merz   McLellan

. His first major project was the 
Neptune Bank Power Station in 

Wallsend
 near Newcastle. It was the first three-phase electricity supply system in Great Britain, and was opened by 
Lord Kelvin on 
18 June 
1901.


In 1901 Merz toured the USA and Canada.  In 1905 he first attempted to influence Parliament to unify the variety of voltages and frequencies in the country's electricity supply industry, but it was not until 

World War I
 that Parliament began to take this idea seriously, then appointing him head of a Parliamentary Committee to address the problem.  


Between 1907 and 1913 Merz was hired by 





Thomas James Tait




 to electrify the railway system in 

Melbourne
, 

Australia
. The new system began operation in 1919.


In 1916 Merz pointed out that the UK could use its small size to its advantage, by creating a dense distribution grid to feed its industries efficiently. His findings led to the Williamson Report of 1918, which in turn created the Electricity Supply Bill of 1919. The bill was the first step towards an integrated system. He also sat on the Weir Committee, which produced the more significant Electricity (Supply) Act of 1926, leading to the setting up of the 
National Grid. 


Merz's own system ran at 40 hertz, 20,000 volts, but he was forced to convert it to 50 hertz to match the European system. 


In 1940 Merz designed the electric drive equipment for the 

TOG 1
 
tank. In the same year, he and his two children were killed at their house in 

Kensington
, 

London
, by a German bomb.




Legacy


The Faculty of Engineering at 

Cambridge University
 manages a Charles Hesterman Merz Fund.


The 
School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne is named Merz Court.

Carry On Cabby is the seventh 

Carry On film
 released in 



1963


 and the first one written by series mainstay 













Talbot Rothwell












.  This was the first film in the series to feature Carry On regular 




Jim Dale



.  The previous film in the series, 

Carry On Cruising
, was filmed in 
technicolor, this movie marked the series' return to a black and white format.  Carry On Cabby was originally planned as a non-Carry On film, called Call Me A Cab (after a stage play) but midway through it became part of the Carry On series.


Plot summary


Charlie Hawkins is the workaholic owner of a thriving cab company named Speedee Cabs. But his beloved yet neglected wife Peggy is sick of playing second fiddle to her fanatic husband's business. When he fails to remember to take her out on their anniversary, she decides she's had enough and secretly launches a rival cab firm to teach her obsessed husband a lesson. And what's the secret of her success? She specialises in employing only the finest, and most beautiful young women as her drivers.


Peggy's company becomes a thriving success due to the large number of male taxi passengers preferring to ogle her sexy drivers during journeys. Charlie does not realise who runs this competing company and plans to sabotage their success.

Status


Evans (1932) records the Orange-tail Awl as 'Rare' in India and 'Very Rare' in the Andaman islands. He records the butterfly as 'Not Rare' in South Myanmar, the Malay peninsula and parts of the Indonesian archipelago.4




Description




See 
glossary for terms used.

Both sexes: The butterfly has a wingspan of 45 to 50mm.4 Above, both sexes are an unblemished dark-brown. The hindwing has an orange fringe.The abdomen is orange towards the rear of the butterfly. Below, the wings have white patches; the forewing having having a large white central patch, and the hindwing having a broad pure white discal band.3


The male has no brands.3



Detailed description


Watson (1891) gives a detailed description as follows :-5




Male. Upperside dark chocolate brown. Cilia of hindwing carmine-red. Underside maroon brown ; forewing with a large buff-white patch from the middle of posterior margin, bordered above with purple ; hindwing with a broad transverse purple white band terminating before the anal angle, the inner border of which is sharply defined, the outer suffusing itself on the disk. Cilia carmine-red. Palpi and thorax in front, beneath and anal tuft dull yellow. Thorax beneath greyish brown.

:The female is described by Mr. 






Moore





 in his  Lepidoptera of Ceylon  as not differing from the male.





Taxonomy


The skipper has two subspecies:



 B. sena sena (






Moore





, 1865) - Type locality Bengal. Distribution: Sri Lanka, S.India - Burma, Thailand, Laos, Hainan, Andamans.2 


 B. sena uniformis 











Elwes










   Edwards 1897 - Type locality Java. Distribution: Burma, Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Java, Kangean, Bali, Lombok, Bawean, Sumba, Sumbawa.2






Habits


Diurnal.6 The butterfly is confined to heavy jungle of low elevations, typically up to 4000 to 5000 ft. The male can be seen in the early mornings, basking on the top of leaves in forest glades and hilltops, chasing off intruders. The typical resting position of the Orange-tail Awl is the underside of the leaf. He does not mud-puddle or visit flowers. The female is usually found close to the host-plants.3




Life cycle


The larva has been recorded on 
Combretum latifolium2 and 
Combretum extensum in Kanara3.

For other persons named John Hastings, see 
John Hastings (disambiguation).
John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (October 1372   
December 30, 
1389), was the son of 


John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke

 and 
Anne Manny, 2nd Baroness Manny. He was also 
Baron Abergavenny.


 Infant Inheritance 



He succeeded his father as an infant in 1375. 




 Marriage 



He married Elizabeth, the daughter of 
John of Gaunt, in 1380, but the marriage was 
unconsummated and was 
annulled in 1383. 


He subsequently married 
Philippa Mortimer, daughter of 

Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March
, but had no children.




 Death in a Joust 





Richard II
 held his Christmas court at 








Woodstock Palace







 in 1389, and Pembroke took part in the Christmas sports, including 
jousting. While running a course against 
Sir John Des, he was struck in the groin by his opponent's lance and subsequently died of his injuries. Upon his death, the 
Earldom of Pembroke and the 
Barony of Manny  became extinct, while the 
Barony of Hastings passed to a cousin.


He was described by the chronicler as being mourned by the common people as well as the nobility, by reason of his kind and generous nature.

La Salle Military Academy was a 
Catholic school with 
middle school/
junior high school and 
high school divisions located in 

Oakdale, New York
. It closed in 2001, and the school's rather extensive campus is now owned by 
St. John's University, New York.

The school was founded by the 
Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, or  Christian Brothers  (sometimes called the  De La Salle Brothers,  having been founded by St. 

Jean-Baptiste de la Salle
 in 

France
 in the 1600s as an organization of Catholic men under vows dedicated to teaching; the term  De La Salle  brothers distinguishes them from the Irish 






Congregation of Christian Brothers





 and other, similarly-named and purposed groups).


The school was actually founded in 
Westchester, New York in 1883 as Westchester Institute. Soon thereafter, the school relocated to 





Clason Point




 in the 
Bronx, New York, and was renamed Clason Point Military Academy. In 1926, the school purchased the estate of 

Frederick Gilbert Bourne
, of the 






Singer sewing machine company





, which featured a 110-room mansion, 







Indian Neck Hall






, overlooking 



Great South Bay


, 







Long Island






 (the building had been designed by 


Ernest Flagg

).


The school had extensive boarding facilities and attracted many sons of the wealthiest Catholic families in the 
northeastern United States. In the mid-1990s, the school decided to begin admitting girls as well as non-military students.  


Alumni include numerous famous people, including Hollywood movie director 


John Frankenheimer

, former New Hampshire Governor and White House Chief of Staff 

John H. Sununu
, former Nicaraguan President and dictator 













Anastasio Somoza Debayle












, and former U.S. Congressman from New York 
John M. Murphy (1965 graduation speaker). It also had a large New York mafia family patronage, including sons of the Gambino crime family.

Hidden subgroup problem

Group theory
Quantum algorithms
Quantum information science




The hidden subgroup problem (HSP) is a topic of research in 
mathematics and 
theoretical computer science. 


Problem statement


Given a 
group G, a 
subgroup H   G, and a set X, we say a function f : G   X separates 
cosets of H if for all g1, g2   G,
f(g1) = f(g2) if and only if g1H = g2H.


Hidden subgroup problem: Let G be a group, X a finite set, and f : G   X a function such that there exists a subgroup H   G for which f separates cosets of H. The function f is given via an oracle. Using information gained from evaluations of f via its oracle, determine a generating set for H.




Motivation


The importance of this problem is due to two facts:





 







Shor's quantum algorithm






 for factoring and discrete logarithm (as well as several of its extensions) is a special case of HSP;


 Designing an efficient quantum algorithm for HSP for arbitrary groups would result in efficient quantum algorithms for two major problems: the 
graph isomorphism problem and certain 
shortest vector problems (SVPs) in lattices. (More precisely, an efficient quantum algorithm for HSP for the 
symmetric group would give a quantum algorithm for the graph isomorphism. An efficient quantum algorithm for HSP for the 
dihedral group would give a quantum algorithm for the poly(n) unique SVP (Aharonov, Regev).)






 Algorithms 



There is a 
polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving HSP over 


Abelian group

s. (In the case of hidden subgroup problem,
 a polynomial time algorithm  means an algorithm whose running time is a polynomial of the logarithm of the size of the group.) Shor's algorithm is one particular case of this quantum algorithm.


For arbitrary groups, it is known that the hidden subgroup problem is solvable using a polynomial number of evaluations of the oracle (Ettinger, Hoyer and Knill), if the running time (including non-oracle operations) can be exponential. However, to design efficient algorithms for the graph isomorphism and SVP, one needs an algorithm for which both the number of oracle evaluations and the running time are polynomial. 


The existence of such algorithm for arbitrary groups is open. Quantum polynomial time algorithms exist for certain subclasses of groups, such as semi-direct products of some 


Abelian group

s.   


Most current approaches to this problem involve partial measurement after a quantum Fourier transform. This approach has been shown to be insufficient for the hidden subgroup problem for the symmetric group (Hallgren, Moore, Roetller, Russell, and Sen).

Essays on Philosophical Subjects, by the 

Scottish
 economist 


Adam Smith

. A history of 
astronomy down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on 
ancient physics and 
metaphysics.

This work was published posthumously, in 1795, using material which 


Adam Smith

 had intended to publish eventually but had not prepared at the time of his death in 1790.  This was done by his literary executors, two old friends from the Scottish academic world; physicist/chemist 

Joseph Black
 and pioneering geologist 


James Hutton

.  A brief account of their work appears in a section entitled 'Advertisement by the Editors'.


The book consists of three distinct works:



 The History of Astronomy


 The History of the Ancient Physics


 The History of the Ancient Logics and 
Metaphysics




The History of Astronomy is the largest of these and is thought to have been written in the 1750s, before Smith's major works.  The overall understanding is excellent, though the 

Glasgow
 Edition of 1976 includes some detailed criticism of his use of sources.  But also defends him for calling 


Newton

 a philosopher rather than a 
scientist; the word 'scientist' did not exist before 1839.


It is also interesting for containing Smith's first mention of the 
Invisible Hand:




For it may be observed, that in all 
Polytheistic religions, among savages, as well as in the early ages of 
heathen 
antiquity, it is the irregular events of nature only that are ascribed to the agency and power of the gods.  Fire burns, and water refreshes; heavy bodies descend, and lighter substances fly upwards, by the necessity of their own nature; nor was the invisible hand of Jupiter every apprehended to be employed in those matters.  (III.2, page 49 of the Glasgow Edition.)

Wild Oats Markets was an operator of 
natural foods stores and 
farmers markets in North America.  The stores offered dry grocery, meat, poultry, seafood, dairy, frozen, prepared foods, bakery, vitamins and supplements, health and body care, and household items. As of February 21, 2007, it operated 110 stores in 24 states and British Columbia, Canada.  Wild Oats Markets was the nation's second largest natural and organic foods chain. Wild Oats Markets was founded in 1987 and was headquartered in 
Boulder, Colorado.


On 
February 21 
2007, Wild Oats' rival 

Whole Foods Market, Inc
 announced that it had agreed to acquire Wild Oats for an estimated $565 million.  After an extensive regulatory battle with the 

FTC
, a federal appeals court consented to the deal.  Whole Foods officially completed their buyout of Wild Oats on 
August 27 
2007. The company is currently in the process of converting their remaining Wild Oats locations to the Whole Foods name.



History


Wild Oats was founded in 1987 with the purchase of 
Crystal Market in Boulder, Colorado.  Crystal Market was re-named Wild Oats Vegetarian Market in 1992.  


Wild Oats Markets acquired the 11-store Boulder-based 
Alfalfa's Markets chain in July 1996. Three 
Capers Community Market natural foods stores, located in British Columbia, were part of the Alfalfa's acquisition and have maintained the Capers name.  In 1999, Wild Oats acquired several divisions, including 11 San Diego-based 
Henry's Marketplace stores (rebranded Henry's Farmers Market in 2004), the Nature's Northwest chain of stores in Portland, OR, and nine San Antonio-based 
Sun Harvest stores. 


In 2001, 
Perry Odak became President and Chief Executive Officer of Wild Oats Markets, coming from 
Ben   Jerry s. Odak resigned in October 2006 after he and the company were unable to reach an agreement for a new employment contract. Gregory Mays, Chairman of the Board, was named interim chief executive officer. Mays is a former chief financial officer of 

Ralphs
 Grocery Co.1 


Wild Oats announced that it would close all five of its Henry's Farmers Market stores in Arizona on December 16, 2006, and would instead focus on the Wild Oats banner in that market.2



Partnership with Pathmark


Wild Oats Markets partnered with 

Pathmark Stores
 beginning in February 2007 when Pathmark added Wild Oats brand private-label goods to all of its 141 northeast U.S. stores. About 150 different natural and organic products were included in the partnership, including specialty products such as imported Italian sodas, 
balsamic vinegar, 
organic fruit spreads and 
flatbread crackers.3




Sale to Whole Foods Market


On 
February 21, 
2007, 

Whole Foods Market
 announced that it had agreed to acquire Wild Oats for an estimated $565 million.456  Following a two-year integration period, the Wild Oats banner will eventually disappear.


On June 27, 2007, the 

Federal Trade Commission
 issued an administrative complaint challenging the acquisition. According to the complaint, the FTC believed that the proposed transaction  would violate federal 
antitrust laws by eliminating the substantial competition between these two uniquely close competitors in the operation of premium natural and organic supermarkets nationwide  and contended that  if the transaction goes forward Whole Foods would have the ability to raise prices and reduce quality and services. 7  On 
August 23 
2007, the 
federal appeals court for the D.C. circuit refused to block the deal, citing increasing competition in the organic grocery business from traditional grocers like 

Safeway
 and 

Kroger
 as reasoning for allowing the deal.8


Whole Foods officially completed their buyout of Wild Oats on 
August 27 
20079 Whole Foods plans to upgrade and improve some Wild Oats locations before rebranding them to the  Whole Foods  name.  Other Wild Oats locations will either be relocated or closed. In October 2007 the company completed the sale of all 35 Henry's Farmers Market and Sun Harvest Market stores to a subsidiary of Los Angeles grocer Smart   Final Inc. for $166 million.10

Notable achievements





Supermarket News ranked Wild Oats No. 63 in the 2007  Top 75 North American Food Retailers  based on 2006 fiscal year estimated sales of $1.2 billion.11 







Wild Oats was included in Corporate Responsibility Officer (CRO) magazine s annual  100 Best Corporate Citizens  list for 2007, ranking No. 59 out of 1,100 U.S. public companies surveyed.1213 The ranking is based on measures of corporate service to eight groups: shareholders, community, governance, diversity, employees, environment, human rights and product.







Wild Oats made a big contribution in the start of 
Fair Trade bananas by making a commitment to TransFair USA to replace their organic bananas by Fair Trade organic bananas. TransFair needed this back-up of a big retail-chain to be able to start this business, because of needed economies of scale and turnover speed.14

 (21 February 1844   25 June 1908) was a career British colonial governor, serving as Governor of 

Sierra Leone
 from 1880, of 
Natal, of 
Madras, of 
Ceylon from 1890 to 1895, and of 






Tasmania





 from 1901 to 1904.


Early life and family


Havelock was born in 1844 in 

Bath
, 
Somerset, the fifth surviving son of Lieutenant-Colonel 
William Havelock and Caroline Elizabeth Chaplin, and the nephew of 











Sir Henry Havelock










. The family moved to 

India
 in 1844, where his father commanded the 



14th Light Dragoons


 but was killed in action at the 

Battle of Ramnagar
 on 22 November 1848. The Havelocks returned to England briefly, but settled in 

Ootacamund
 in 1950, where Havelock attended school until he completed his education in 

London
.1




Military career


In 1860, Havelock entered the 
Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, and on 14 January 1862 was gazetted an 




Ensign



 in the 



32nd (Cornwall) Light Infantry


. He was promoted 









Lieutenant








 on 10 April 1866, and was stationed at 

Gibraltar
 (1866 7), at 

Mauritius
 (1867 8), then at the 

Cape Colony
 (1868 72).1 He returned to Mauritius in 1872 as the colony's 
paymaster, and was promoted to 




Captain



 on 1 February 1873, serving as 
aide-de-camp to Selby Smith, the acting governor, and later to the 
Governor of Mauritius, 

























Sir Arthur Hamilton-Gordon
























.1


He held several key posts in the colonial civil service from 1874: Chief 
Civil Commissioner of the 

Seychelles
 (1874 75), and 
Colonial Secretary and 
Receiver General in 

Fiji
 (1874 75). He returned to England in 1876, and retired from the 
British Army as a captain in March 1877.1




Colonial service


Havelock joined the colonial civil service upon leaving the army, and was sent to the 
West Indies in 1877 as 
President of Nevis. In 1878, he was transferred to 

Saint Lucia
 as the colony's 
Administrator, before returning to the 

Seychelles
 as Chief Civil Commissioner.



Governor of Sierra Leone


In February 1881, Havelock was assigned his first governorship in 

Sierra Leone
 and the 
West African settlements. In addition, he was appointed British consul to 

Liberia
, and became involved in a major border dispute between Liberia and 

Great Britain
.


The area in question was known as the 
Gallinas territory, an area lying between the 
Sewa River and the 



Mano River


, and the vague border between Sierra Leone and Liberia had been unsettled for years. On 20 March 1882, Havelock led a flotilla of four British gunboats to the Liberian capital 

Monrovia
, issuing a demand that Liberia cede all territories up to the 
Mafa River to Great Britain, and pay an indemnity of  8,500 to British merchant traders for injuries inflicted in 1871 by tribes inhabiting the area of the British claim. A treaty was signed, but its ratification was refused by the 





Liberian Senate




, and Havelock and his gunboats returned to Monrovia in September that year, demanding immediate acknowledgement of the British claims, and ratification of the treaty. The senate refused once more, and although Havelock's diplomacy prevented a bloody conflict, British troops from Sierra Leone marched into the disputed territory several months later. Despite the support of the 








United States







, Liberia realised that resisting the British claim was futile, and signed the treaty in London on 22 November 1885.2 The border was finally settled in 1903 by a mixed commission from both countries.




Governor of Trinidad, Natal


In 1885, Havelock was appointed 
Governor of Trinidad, and in 1886, 
Governor of Natal, where he dealt with the 
annexation of 




Zululand



 in 1887, and an unsuccessful rebellion led by 










Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo









 in 1888. He returned to England in 1889, and served on the international anti-slavery commission in 

Brussels
.1




Governor of Ceylon, Madras


In March 1890, Havelock was appointed Governor of Ceylon (now 

Sri Lanka
)3, where his actions included extending 
the country's railways to 

Kurunegala
 and 

Bandarawela
, and abolishing the 'paddy tax', a levy on rice cultivation.4 He returned to his childhood home of India as 
Governor of Madras from 1896 to 1900.




Governor of Tasmania


Havelock left Madras in 1901, and was offered the governorships of the 

Straits Settlements
 in 
Malaya and 




Victoria



 in 

Australia
, which he declined due to ill health caused by many stressful years in tropical climates. He was then offered the post of 
Governor of Tasmania, which he accepted, arriving in 

Hobart
 on 8 November. His health, however, continued to decline and he made the decision to cut short his term as governor to only two-and-a-half years. He notified the premier, 

William Propsting
, of his resignation on 6 January 1904, and left 






Tasmania





 on 16 April.5





Later life


Havelock returned to 

England
, and retired to 

Torquay
, 

Devon
. His wife, Anne Grace, nee Norris, died in early 1908, and Havelock himself died at 

Bath
, 
Somerset less than six months later on 25 June. He was survived by a daughter.5




Honours


Havelock was appointed 
CMG in 1880. He was knighted KCMG in 1884, and GCMG in 1895. He was awarded the 






GCSI





 (1896), and 






GCIE





 (1901) for his work in India.5

Fly by Night







Best I Can is a rock song by the Canadian trio 





Rush




 that is featured on their 
1975 release, 

Fly by Night
. It differs from many other Rush songs in their post-debut era, as it has little of the classical influence that defines many of Rush's other works. Rather, it focuses on a catchy, blues-oriented, re-occurring riff, and contains standard verses and choruses, and a guitar solo section over the chorus chord progression.  Best I Can  is thought by many Rush fans to be a remnant of their debut album, 

Rush
, prior to when 



Neil Peart


 joined the band, who brought with him more intellectual, poetic lyrical pieces. In the years of Fly by Night and onwards, the band delved more into the realms of progressive rock, distinguishing their unique sound and leaving the standard blues-rock songs behind. Unlike the rest of the songs on Fly by Night, the lyrics were written by 





Geddy Lee




, not 



Neil Peart


.

Suburbs of Adelaide







Hotel Lord Exmouth, in Exeter



Exeter is a north-western 
suburb of 

Adelaide
 14km from the 
CBD, on the 
LeFevre Peninsula, in the state of 
South Australia, 

Australia
 and falls under the 

City of Port Adelaide Enfield
. It is adjacent to 

Semaphore
, 





Birkenhead




, 





Largs Bay




 and 

Glanville
. The post code for Exeter is 5019. It is bounded to the south by Exmouth Street, to the north by Hargrave Street and in the east and west by the 




Outer Harbor railway line



 and Woolnough Road respectively.

Exeter is essentially a residential suburb.



 History 



On 18 May 1850, Phillip Levi purchased the land sections 1104-1107, Hundred of 

Port Adelaide
. By April 1851, section 1106 was owned by John Lapthorne, who had subdivided it sometime before January 1854, however the name of Exeter does not appear on official documents until 1882 when William Wells cut part of section 1106. John Lapthorne sailed to 
South Australia on the Orissa in 1840. He was born in 

Exeter
, in the 

English
 county of 

Devon
, in 1807 and died at Exeter, Adelaide in 1889; the suburb is named after his home town. Numerous 
other places have also been given the name Exeter.


Exeter 
post office opened 1 October 1947, but closed 14 May 1986.1




 Facilities 


The suburb is not served by a primary school, and the closest is Le Fevre Primary School in Birkenhead, or the Catholic Dominican Primary School in Semaphore. The local high school is Le Fevre High School, in nearby 





Semaphore South




. There is little commercial activity in the area, as this is plentiful east of the river in 

Port Adelaide
.




 Transport 



The 352   353 serves Woolnough Road and Hargrave Street, while the 156   333 serve Causeway Road. The suburb is also served by two train stations on the 




Outer Harbor railway line



, the 





Glanville railway station




, just beyond its eastern border, and the 





Peterhead railway station




 on its eastern border.

Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) is a minor 
phospholipid component of cell membranes. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is enriched at the 
plasma membrane where it is an important substrate for a number of important signaling proteins.1














Phospholipase C











 
hydrolyzes the phosphodiester link in PtdIns(4,5)P2 forming 
inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) and 
diacylglycerol (DAG).


PtdIns(4,5)P22 is formed primarily by the type I phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate 5 kinases from PI(4)P.



Class I PI 3-kinases phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P2 forming 
phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). Both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 not only act as substrates for enzymes but also serve as docking phospholipids that bind specific domains that promote the recruitment of proteins to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of signaling cascades.

University of Salamanca faculty
1699 deaths
1630 births
Spanish Roman Catholics




Joseph Saenz de Aguirre  (born at 
Logro, in 
Old Castile, 
24 March, 
1630; died 
19 August, 
1699) was a 








Cardinal







, and learned 



Spanish


 
Benedictine. He entered the congregation of 












Monte Cassino











. 

He directed the studies in the 
Monastery of St. Vincent of Salamanca for fifteen years, and became its 
abbot. He then qualified in dogmatic theology and inaugurated the course in Holy Scripture at the 

University of Salamanca
. 


He was councillor and secretary of the 
Holy Office and president of its congregation of the province of Spain. His work against the 
Declaration of the Gallican Clergy of 1682 won him a cardinal's hat and the warm eulogy of 
Innocent XI. 


His correspondence with 
Bossuet shows how vigorously he combated 
Quietism. His excessive labors undermined his health, and for many years he suffered from 
epileptic seizures. 


He died suddenly from a stroke of 
apoplexy. He was buried in the Spanish Church of St. James in Rome, and his heart was deposited in Monte Cassino, as he had requested.



Works



His more important works are on philosophical and theological subjects, but he also produced valuable writings on ecclesiastical history, commentaries on the theology of 
St. Anselm, two volumes of miscellanea, and a book to prove that the 
De Imitatione Christi was by the Benedictine, 






Jean Gerson





.


His principal works on philosophy are: 





 Philosophia Nova-antiqua  etc., a defense of 


Aristotle

 and 
St. Thomas Aquinas against their opponents (Salamanca, 1671-2-5, 3 in fol.)


 Philosophia Morum  etc. (Salamanca, 1677; Rome, 1698), a commentary in four volumes on 
Aristotle's Ethics


 De virtutibus et vitiis disputationes ethicae in quibus disseritur quidquid spectat ad philosophiam moralem ab Aristotele traditam  (Salamanca, 1677; 2d ed. enlarged, Rome, 1697; 3d. ed. Rome, 1717). 




His principal theological works are



 a treatise on the 
Angels, especially the Guardian Angels, which he prepared as his 
thesis for the degree of 
Doctor. 


 S. Anselmi Theologia, commentariis et disputationibus tum dogmaticis tum scholasticis illustrata  (Salamanca, 1678-81, 2d ed. Rome, 1688-90). The third volume,  De natura hominis pura et lapsa , is especially directed against 









Jansenism











 Auctoritas infallibilis et summa Cathedrae Sancti Petri , etc. (Salamanca, 1683), a learned refutation of the four articles of the Declaration of the Gallican Clergy of France in 1682.


 Collectio maxima conciliorum omnium Hispaniae et novi orbis , etc. (Salamanca, 1686).

The Shrine of Imam Husayn ibn Ali in Karbala, Iraq


 
The Shrine of Husayn ibn Ali (

Arabic
:                    lrm;) is a 





holy site




 of 
Sh 'a Islam in the city of 

Karbala
, 

Iraq
. It stands on the site of the grave of 

Husayn ibn Ali
, the second grandson of 





Muhammad




, near the place where he was killed during the 

Battle of Karbala
 in 680.12 The tomb of Husayn ibn Ali is one of the holiest places for Shias outside of 
Mecca and 
Medina, and many make 
pilgrimages to the site. Up to a million pilgrims visit the city to observe 
Ashura, which marks the anniversary of Husayn ibn Ali's death.3

The 
Sunni 







Umayyad






 and 







Abbasid






 
caliphs prevented construction of the shrines and discouraged pilgrimage to the sites.4 The tomb and its annexes were destroyed by Abbasid caliph 





Al-Mutawakkil




 in 850-851 and Shi'a pilgrimage was prohibited, but shrines in Karbala and Najaf were built by the 
Buwayhid emir 
'Adud al-Daula in in 979-80.5


Two main roads lead the visitor to Karbala. One is from the Iraqi capital Baghdad, through Al-Musails, and the other is from 

Najaf
.


At the city's entrance there is a row of houses decorated with wooden columns. The boundary wall of the shrine surrounds wooden gates covered with glass decorations, and through the gates there is a precinct surrounded by small rooms called  Iwans .


Husayn's grave is located in the middle of the precinct, surrounded by square shaped structures called  Rawaq . The grave itself is located in the middle of the Zari with golden windows around it, with ornate illumination.

There are many opinions among different investigators, as to the origin of the word  Karbala . Some have pointed out that  Karbala  has a connection to the  Karbalato  language, while others attempt to derive the meaning of word  Karbala  by analysing its spelling and language. They conclude that it originates from the Arabic word  Kar Babel  which was a group of ancient Babylonian villages that included Nainawa, Al-Ghadiriyya, Karbella, Al-Nawaweess, and Al-Heer. This last name is today known as Al-Hair and is where Hussain ibn Ali s grave is located.


The investigator Yaqut al-Hamawy had pointed out that the meaning of  Karbala  could have several explanations, one of which is that the place where Hussain ibn Ali was martyred is made of soft earth -  Al-Karbalat .


Other writers made the connection between the name and the disastrous event which painted the desert with blood, and so the word  Karbala  was said to compose of two Arabic words:  Karb  meaning grief and sorrow, and  Balaa  meaning affliction. Such a connection, in fact, has no scientific evidence, since Karbala was known as such even before the arrival of Hussain ibn Ali.




Martyrdom and popularity


Karbala was at first an uninhabited place and did not witness any construction activity, although it was rich in water and its soil fertile.


From the time of Hussain ibn Ali's death in 680 
pilgrimages to commemorate the massacre have often been repressed.4


Despite many attempts by successive rulers, such as Al-Rashid and Al-Mutawakkil, to put a restriction on the development of this area, it has nonetheless spread with time to become a city.




Mausoleum of Hussain ibn Ali


The historian Ibn Kuluwayh mentioned that those who buried Hussain ibn Ali, made a special and rigid construction with signs above the grave.


Higher and bigger constructions above the grave started during the ruling of Al-Saffah, but Harun al-Rashid later on, put heavy restrictions to prevent people from visiting the grave.


At the time of Al-Mamun, construction around the grave resumed until the year 236 AH when Al-Mutawakkil ordered the destruction and digging of the grave, and then filling the pit with water. His son, who succeeded him, allowed people to visit the grave site, and since then building the precinct to the grave increased and developed step by step.


On the other hand, the historian Ibn Al-Athir, stated that in the year 371 AH, Aadod Al-Dawla Al-Boowayhi became the first to largely lay the foundations for large scale construction, and generously decorated the place. He also built houses and markets around the precinct, and surrounded Karbala with a high boundary wall turning it into a strong castle.


In the year 407 AH, the precinct caught fire due to the dropping of two large candles on the wooden decorations, but Hassan ibn Fadl (the state minister) rebuilt the damaged sections.


History has recorded the names of several rulers who shared the honor of widening, decorating or keeping the precinct in good condition. Amongst them is Fateh Ali al-Qajari, who in 1250 AH ordered the construction of two domes, one over Hussain ibn Ali's grave and the other over his brother 
Abbas ibn Ali.


The first dome is 27 meters high and completely covered with gold. At the bottom, it is surrounded with 12 windows, each of which is about 1.25 m away from the other, from the inside, and 1.30 m from the outside.


The mausoleum has an area of 59 m / 75 m with ten gates, and about 65 rooms, well decorated from the inside and outside, used as classrooms for studying.


As for the grave itself, in the middle of the precinct, it is called the  Rawda  or garden and it has several doors. The most famous one is called  Al-Qibla  or  Bab al-Dhahab . When it is entered, one can see the tomb of 




Habib ibn Madhahir al-Asadi



, to the right hand side. Habib was a friend and companion of 

Husayn
 since their childhood. He was one of those who were honored with martyrdom at the Battle of Karbala.


Within the shrine of 

Husayn
 can also be found a grave of all the 
72 martyrs of Karbala. They were buried in a mass grave which was then covered with soil to the ground level. This mass grave is at the foot of 

Husayn
's grave. As well, beside 

Husayn
's grave are the graves of his two sons 






Ali al-Akbar





 and the 6-month old 






Ali al-Asghar





.  Also buried within the mosque is one of the grandsons of the 



Twelver Shi'a's


 seventh Imam, who spent his life preaching about Karbala.

Winter Palace







, painted by Grigory Chernetsov, 1827







Plan showing the location of the Military Gallery within the palace



The Military Gallery (

Russian
:                ) is a gallery of the 








Winter Palace







 in 

Saint Petersburg
, 

Russia
. The gallery is a setting for 332 
portraits of 
generals who took part in the 
Patriotic War of 1812. The portraits were painted by 






George Dawe





 and his Russian assistants 

Alexander Polyakov
 and 
Wilhelm August Golike.


The top-lit barrel-vaulted hall in which the gallery is accommodated was designed by architect 








Carlo Rossi







 and constructed from June to November 1826. It replaced several small rooms in the middle of the main block of the Winter Palace - between the White Throne Hall and the Greater Throne Hall, just a few steps from the palace church. The gallery was opened in a solemn ceremony on 
25 December 
1826.


During the 



Soviet


 era, the gallery collection was enriched  with four portraits of 
palace grenadiers, the special troops created in 1827 to guard the house for veterans of the Patriotic War. The portraits were also painted by George Dawe, in 1828. More recently, the gallery acquired two paintings by 






Peter von Hess





 from the 1840s.

Oscar Constantine Da Costa - A very capable all-round cricketer from the early to mid 1930 s, Oscar da Costa was born in 

Kingston
, 











Jamaica










 on 
September 11, 
1907 and died there prematurely on 
October 1, 
1936, aged just 29.  A reliable 
batsman, a useful medium-pace 
bowler and an agile, versatile 
fielder, he made his first-class career for Jamaica in February 1929 against a touring England XI put together and led by Sir 
Julien Cahn; Da Costa himself bowled the opposing captain for 0 in the visitor s first innings.  In 1930, in only his fifth 
first-class match, he was selected to play in the fourth 
Test match against England and performed adequately, scoring 39 in his only visit to the crease, taking a wicket in each of the English innings and holding three catches in the match.  In 1933, he was selected to tour England with 

West Indies
.  He scored over 1,000 runs on the tour at an average of 26.82, including his maiden century, 105 against 

Essex
 at 

Leyton
.  However, he was less successful in the three Test matches, scoring just 70 runs from six innings and taking one wicket.  After this, Da Costa appeared just once more for the West Indies, this being the second Test of England s visit to the 





Caribbean




 at 

Port of Spain
 in 1934/35 where he helped the home team to a convincing victory.  Interestingly, Oscar da Costa never played a first-class match against any of the other colonial islands and only nine of his 39 matches were for Jamaica.  All his matches were played against Select XIs, against counties and Universities on the 1933 tour, or were played against England in Test matches.  He was considered something of a joker and carried a rubber stamp with his signature on to save time went asked to provide and autograph or two!  Da Costa has the unenviable distinction of being the first West Indian Test cricketer to die but no obituary originally appeared within the covers 
Wisden for him.

The Fall






Seminal Live is a 1989 album by British rock band 


The Fall

, recorded partly in the studio and partly at live performances in 1988. The album was the last to be released by the group through 






Beggars Banquet Records





, and as such is often seen as a  contractual obligation  album. It was also the last Fall album to feature 











Brix Smith










, former wife of lead singer 





Mark E. Smith




, until her return for 1995's 

Cerebral Caustic
.

The studio recordings on Seminal were all new songs and make up the first five tracks of the album side one on the original vinyl release. The live recordings on side two, meanwhile, are all versions of previously released tracks. Partly because of this, critical response to the album was somewhat mixed. 
Andrew Collins, writing in the 

NME
, suggests,  Seminal Live is worse than an intellectual letdown, it's a tease. 1 The songs themselves also provoked a variety of responses from journalists. Jason Pettigrew of the 

Alternative Press
 writes,  For pure weirdness value, look no further than  Mollusc in Tyrol , a musique concrete rave-up on top of a Neubauten  Yu-Gung  rhythm track that's been buried alive. 2 A reviewer for the 











Record Mirror










, by contrast, says,  'Mollusc In Tyrol' is a totally unbearable drone which should never have found its way from the vaults. 3 In fact, it was not really a Fall recording at all, being a reworking by Mark E. Smith of  Donkeys Bearing Cups  by 
Craig Leon, from his 1981 album Nommos. Leon went on to produce tracks on the band's next album,

, 

England
. Founded in 1947, they played Sunday football for a period and re-formed a Saturday side in 1993, to play in the 
North Bucks and District League. They joined the 




South Midlands League



 Division One in 1996, and then when that league merged with the 




Spartan League



 to form the 

Spartan South Midlands League
 in 1997 they became founder members of the new competition.

They are currently members of Spartan South Midlands League Division Two.

Mursley also have a reserve side which competes in Reserve Division One of the Spartan South Midlands League, after winning Reserve Division Two in 2004-05

Federal Reserve
Primary dealers




A primary dealer is a 
bank or securities 
broker-dealer that may trade directly with the 
Federal Reserve System of the 








United States







.1 They are required to make bids or offers when the Fed conducts 
open market operations, provide information to the Fed's open market trading desk, and to participate actively in 

 U.S. Treasury
 securities 
auctions.2 They consult with both the U.S. Treasury and the Fed about funding the 
budget deficit and implementing 
monetary policy. Many former employees of primary dealers work at the Treasury, because of their expertise in the government debt markets, though the Fed avoids a similar 
revolving door policy.
http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/search_result.asp?agency=Federal+Reserve+System id=EIFRS
http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/search_result.asp?agency=Treasury+%28executive+offices%29 id=EATRE01

Between them, these dealers purchase the vast majority of the U.S. 
Treasury securities (T-bills, T-notes, and T-bonds) sold at auction, and resell them to the public.  Their activities extend well beyond the Treasury market, for example, according to the 
Wall Street Journal Europe (2/9/06 p. 20), all of the top ten dealers in the 
foreign exchange market are also primary dealers, and between them account for almost 73% of forex trading volume. Arguably, this group's members are the most influential and powerful non-governmental institutions in world financial markets.  Group membership changes slowly, with the current list available from the New York Fed.1


The primary dealers form a worldwide network that distributes new U.S. government debt.  For example, Daiwa Securities and Mizuho Securities distribute the debt to Japanese buyers. BNP Paribas, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and 

RBS Greenwich Capital
 (a division of the 

Royal Bank of Scotland
) distribute the debt to European buyers.  Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup account for many American buyers.  Nevertheless, most of these firms compete internationally and in all major financial centers.


In response to the 
subprime mortgage crisis and to the collapse of 

Bear Stearns
, on March 19, 2008, the 
Federal Reserve set up the 
Primary Dealers Credit Facility (PDCF), whereby primary dealers can borrow at the Fed's 
discount window using several forms of 
collateral including mortgage backed loans.3



History


The current system of primary dealers was set up in 1960 with 18 dealers.  The number of primary dealers grew to 46 in 1988 and then declined to 21 in 2007.4


In 2005 Fed trades with primary dealers averaged $550 million per day.


The newest primary dealer (effective on 
August 1, 
2006) is 

Cantor Fitzgerald
. The previous last major addition to the list (excluding name changes) was 
Countrywide Securities, which joined in 1999.5 As of August 4, 2008, the last update to the official list was July 15, 2008.6  Effective July 15, 2008 Countrywide has been removed from the list, due to its takeover by 

Bank of America
 announced on January 11, 2008.


On September 15, 2006, ABN AMRO Bank, N.V., New York Branch withdrew its name from the list of primary dealers; CIBC World Markets Corp. withdrew on February 8, 2007; and Nomura Securities Inc. withdrew on November 30, 2007.


On August 31 2008, Commerzbank announced that it would acquire Dresdner Bank, ending Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Securities' tenure as a primary dealer.


On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and ceased being a primary dealer. On the same day, Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America, and will cease to be a primary dealer when the acquisition closes.


Effective October 1, 2008, Bear, Stearns   Co. was deleted from the list of primary dealers as a result of their acquisition by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.7




Current list


As of 
September 22, 
2008 according to the 








Federal Reserve Bank of New York







 the list includes:







BNP Paribas Securities Corp.







Bank of America Securities LLC





Barclays Capital Inc.




Cantor Fitzgerald   Co.




Citigroup Global Markets Inc.





Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC




Daiwa Securities America Inc.




Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.





Dresdner Kleinwort Securities LLC.
''




Goldman, Sachs   Co.





HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.




J. P. Morgan Securities Inc.




Lehman Brothers Inc.
''




Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc.
''



Mizuho Securities USA Inc.




Morgan Stanley   Co. Incorporated




UBS Securities LLC.




Many changes to the list have occurred during 2008.  Two primary dealers, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and 

Bear Stearns
   Co. Inc., are expected to merge sometime later this year.  Dresdner Kleinwort was bought by 

Commerzbank
 on August 31. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on September 15 and  

Merrill Lynch
 was acquired by Bank of America on the same day.

Ascomycin, also called Immunomycin, FR-900520, FK520, is an 
ethyl analog of 
tacrolimus (FK506) with strong immunosuppressant properties. It can be used to treat 
autoimmune diseases and 
skin diseases, and can help prevent rejection after an 
organ transplant.


Ascomycin acts by binding to 
immunophilins, especially 
macrophilin-12. It appears that Ascomycin inhibits the production of Th1 (interferon- and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) 
cytokines. Additionally, ascomycin preferentially inhibits the activation of 
mast cells, an important cellular component of the atopic response. Ascomycin produces a more selective 
immunomodulatory effect in that it inhibits the elicitation phase of 
allergic contact dermatitis but does not impair the primary immune response when administered systemically.


Ascomycin is produced by the 





fermentation




 of 
Streptomyces hygroscopicus.

Cyclopamine (11-deoxojervine) is a naturally-occurring chemical that belongs to the group of steroidal jerveratrum 
alkaloids. It is a 
teratogen isolated from the corn lily (
Veratrum californicum) that can lead to 
cyclopia (
holoprosencephaly).


Cyclopamine inhibits the 
hedgehog signaling pathway (Hh) by influencing the balance between the active and inactive forms of the 




Smoothened



 protein. Cyclopamine is currently being investigated as a treatment agent in 
basal cell carcinoma, 
medulloblastoma, and 
rhabdomyosarcoma, tumors that result from excessive Hh activity 1, 
glioblastoma, and as a treatment agent for 
multiple myeloma. 


Cyclopamine was named for one-eyed lambs which were born to sheep which grazed on wild corn lily at a farm in Idaho.  In 1957 the US Department of Agriculture started an eleven-year investigation which led to the identification of cyclopamine as the cause of the birth defect.2

Patient trial conducted in Dallas, Texas through APQ research center.  Myeloma patient was given 200 mg of cyclopamine daily for two 2 weeks   every 3 months for a year, for a total of eight weeks or four times, August 2006-August 2007.   M marker was measured and decreased from 1.0 to 0.2 during that time.  There is now a new water-soluble version of cyclopamine that will be tested soon. [    ]
Cyclopamine Tartarate Salt (All Hydroxy Carboxylic Acids) is a white crystaline compound that has been filed for a provisional patent by Logan Natural Products on 2/10/2008.

Echinoidea








Echinothrix diadema''








Diadema setosum''





Diadema urchin can refer to several species of 
sea urchin. The most common urchins to take this name are 
Diadema setosum and 
Echinothrix diadema.


Both species are commonly found in the 





Indo-Pacific




 region, in water up to 70m in depth. D. setosum is more commonly found on sandy sea beds or damaged back reef, whereas E. diadema prefers intact back reef environments.


These two species can be differentiated as D. setosum can have radial white stripes, is slightly larger when full grown, and the opening of the anal opening is surrounded by a red or orange ring. E. diadema has a dark and light spotted anal sac.


It can also be used to refer to the 
genus, 
Diadema of sea urchins, although the species of this genus more appropriately take different common names.

Football venues in the Netherlands
Nijmegen
Buildings and structures in Gelderland










The Goffertstadion or Stadion de Goffert, known as McDOS Goffertstadion for sponsorship reasons, is a football stadium in 

Nijmegen
, 



Netherlands


. It is home to football club 


NEC

.

The stadium was opened on 
July 8, 
1939 by 

Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands



Since 
1951 the opening of the 
International Four Days Marches Nijmegen, the so-called Vlaggenparade, a 
parade with the 
national flags of all participants is held in the stadium.


In 1983 NEC played a 

UEFA Cup
 match against 

FC Barcelona
, still seen as the most important match ever played in the Goffertstadion.


It was rebuilt into a modern stadium with all seats covered and heated and updated catering facilities. The first home-match scheduled in the new stadium took place in September 1999. The grand re-opening was on 
25 January 
2000.


One of the many advantages the renovated stadium offers is the improved atmosphere thanks to the fact that the spectators are now situated much closer to the playing ground. Because of this the players will have a better interaction with the crowd. Also the fact that the capacity has been reduced to 12.470 into a more compact space will result in a better atmosphere during the matches.


Secondly, safety can be guaranteed. The new stadium will only provide seating accommodation which contributes to safety as well. The playing ground and the rest of the stadium are separated from each other by a promenade which is situated under the spectators  seats. This promenade has a double function: It replaces the fences, which, according to some psychologists, can cause aggression among the hard-core supporters. Secondly, the promenade will serve as  the place to be  for food and beverage.


A third advantage is the environmental aspect. All spectators will have a roof over their heads. Their feet will be kept warm because of the heat, which is stored in a specially constructed space under the playing ground, and which will be turned on during matches. The stored heat can also warm up the playing ground so that matches can still take place during winter.


In November 2007 the board of NEC and the city of Nijmegen presented new plans for De Goffert. The capacity is intended to be increased to 18,000 and the stadium will be placed largely underground inside a large hill. This hill will also serve as a home for 
basketball (
Matrixx Magixx), judo and other sports, creating a 'House of Topsports'. The strange, but innovative, design is needed because the city will not allow the stadium to grow in height because of the Goffert Park, which is a protected nature-site. The new stadium should be completed in 2010. 


The Nijmegen venue hosted three international matches of the 

Dutch national football team
 in the 1970s, with the last being a qualifying match for 
Euro 1980 on 
September 20, 
1978 against 

Iceland
: 3-0. The goals were scored by 
















Ruud Krol















, 











Ernie Brandts










 and 







Rob Rensenbrink

People of the Seminole Wars

Native American leaders






Bolek was also the code name of the French WWII intelligence officer 

Gustave Bertrand
.

Bolek (died 1819), also known as Boleck or Bowlegs, was a 

Seminole
 chieftain and brother to 




King Payne



 who later commanded Seminole forces during the 
First Seminole War.

A Seminole chieftain based near the 
Suwanee River of western Florida, Bolek (as would his successor 




Micanopy



) first began opposing American influence in 
Spanish Florida during the early 1800s. Opposing 

Georgian
 slaveholders from pursuing runaway slaves into Seminole territory (some of whom had married into the tribe), in 1812, both he and his brother King Payne began raiding frontier settlements along the Florida-Georgia border. Continuing well after the 

War of 1812
, Seminole bands would fight several engagements with militia forces eventually resulting in the death of King Payne (as well as Bolek suffering serious wounds) during a skirmish with Georgia militia forces under Daniel Newman, later encouraging an expedition by Colonel 

John Williams
 the following year destroying hundreds of Seminole villages and capturing large amounts of horses and cattle. Border warfare would continue between the Seminole and Georgia settlers would lead up to the 

Creek War of 1813-1814
.


During the First Seminole War, American forces under General 





Andrew Jackson




 advanced into northern Florida capturing 




Kinache



's village of 










Miccosukee









 and occupied the British settlement of 

St. Marks
 before reaching Bolek's abandoned village. Capturing two Englishman, a 
Robert Ambrister and Peter Cook, they were marched back to St. Mark and, charged with assisting the Seminoles, were executed by American forces. Although this created an international incident, Jackson continued his offensive recapturing 

Pensacola
. With the purchase of Florida from Spain in 1819, Bolek would be succeeded by his grand-nephew Micanopy following his death shortly after the war.


Another member of the 




Cowkeeper



 dynasty was 




Billy Bowlegs

New Mexico culture
Mexican culture




Matachines (

Spanish
 matachin, or religious dancer) are bands of mummers or in 








Mexico







 usually found in northern Mexico especially in La Laguna Region (Coahuila and Durango), Sinaloa and Chihuaha. They are also very popular in Northern New Mexico and around the 

Rio Grande
, specifically in the border cities of El Paso, Texas, Juarez, Chihuaha (Mexico) and Las Cruces, New Mexico who wander from village to village or from house to house dancing and hosting several Roman Catholic celebrations. Even though they dance and host celebrations throughout the year, their most important performing season is Advent (mostly because the day of Our Lady of Guadalupe falls in that season on December 12th and she is celebrated starting in December and ending about one week before Christmas Eve). The dancers are known for playing in rough-and-ready style a set drama based on the history of 
Montezuma. Even though the dances are based on this story, people who join the Matachines do it for a deeper religious purpose, since most of them join to venerate either Mother Mary (Our Lady of Guadalupe, Our Lady of Lourdes, Immaculate conception, etc...), a saint (the group usually chooses the saint that pertains to the church they belong to), or simply to worship Christ or God the Holy Trinity.

Dressed in fantastic Indian costumes, the chief characters are El Monarca the monarch (Montezuma), the captains (usually consist of 2-4 and are Montezuma's main generals), La Malinche, or Malintzin, the Indian mistress of 
Hernan Cortes; El Toro, the bull, the malevolent comic man of the play (also symbolizes Satan), dressed in buffalo skin with the animal's horns on his head; Abuelo, the grandfather, and Abuela, grandmother. With the help of a chorus of dancers they portray the desertion of his people by Montezuma, the luring of him back by the wiles and smiles of Malinche, the final reunion of king and people and the killing of El Toro, who is supposed to have made all the mischief. Much symbolism is seen in these groups. The most basic symbol of the dance is good vs. evil, with good prevailing. Montezuma and la Malinche represent good, and the bull who represents mischief, Hernan Cortes, represents Satan or evil.


The Indian costumes, the rattles, the arch and the bow are all blessed by a priest, and as he blesses the equipment of that group, it signifies that the priest has agreed to adopt the specific dancing group for that specific church. The dances performed by the matachines, though, have significant symbolism; for example, the dances are prayers and through these prayers and symbolism, they are able to host celebrations, such as rosaries, and or a celebration venerating and or honoring Mary, a saint, or worshiping God (note: neither Mary nor any saint is worshiped in these celebrations; the celebrations usually only honor or venerate these key figures. Only God is worshiped in a celebration like this).

Sportvision is a private company that provides various 
television viewing enhancements to a number of different professional sporting events. They work with 

NFL
, 

NBA
, 

NASCAR
, 

NHL
, 

MLB
 and 











PGA










 broadcasts. They also work with 
college football broadcasts.

In 1996, 
Stan Honey developed a way to track 
hockey pucks with a red dot as seen by television viewers. It was assumed at that time that viewers had a hard time keeping track of the puck. Released as the 






FoxTrax





 puck, it was not a success but led to the 1998 formation of the Sportvision company and later that year the development of the 
1st   Ten computer system, which generates and displays the yellow 
first down line that a TV viewer sees during a live football broadcast. The system became a major hit with television viewers when it was in the 





Super Bowl




 broadcast. It has since become part of all standard 
American professional and 
college football and 
Canadian pro football broadcasts.


Another popular Sportvision product is seen in broadcasts of 

NASCAR
 races. It is called 
RACEf/x, and creates virtual flags above the cars to make them easier to follow by the viewers.


Sportvision also created the 
Pitch f/x system used by 

Major League Baseball
 to provide pitch data to users of 

MLB.com
 
GameDay and viewers of 
Fox, Fox Sports Net, Rogers Sports Net and TBS.

The Quba Khanate was an independent principality on the territory of modern day 

Azerbaijan
 from 1747-1806. The Quba Khanate was founded as a feudal hold around 1680 as a result of a land grant to the Saytaq family, who were related to both the 







Qajar dynasty






 and the Utsmi (duke) of 










Tarki









 in 

Dagestan
 and were thus highly respected among the loacl khanates of 

Azerbaijan
.


The principality achieved independence after the dissolution of 







Safavid






 Persia in 1747 and achieved its greatest prominence under Fath Ali Khan (1758-1789).


As a result of conquests or successful alliances, Fath Ali Khan seized the important port of 


Baku

, the Shamakha Khanate and the Salyan Khanate and organized expeditions as far south as 








Ardabil







 in his fight against the 
Zand dynasty.


The Quba Khanate relied heavy upon Russian arms in all their campaigns. In revenge for the killing of a Russian scientist in 1775, 








Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin







, Russian help was withdrawn, leading to subsequent defeats.


After Fath Ali Khan's death, the Khanate's influence declined. As a result of 
Mohammad Khan Qajar's conquests and the devastation its brought, the Alliance of Northern khanates disintegrated. The Khanate was conquered by Russia in 1806, and was fully incorporated into newly created Shamakha Province by 1816.

Karolyi's





Hilary Coplin Grivich (
May 23 
1977   
May 4 
1997) was a world-class 








American







 
gymnast and 
diver. She was a member of the silver medal-winning American team at the 1991 World Championships and the 1990 junior all-around U.S. National Champion in gymnastics. 


One of the original members of the  Karolyi six-pack, 1 Grivich trained under 
Bela Karolyi in 
Houston 


Texas

. A strong and consistent competitor, she was the all-around U.S. National Champion in the junior division in 1990.2 The following year, competing in her first season at the senior level, she was a member of the silver medal-winning American team at the 








1991 World Championships







, acting as the leadoff gymnast during compulsories and competing second in the lineup on all four events in team finals.34 


Grivich seemed on course for the 
1992 Olympics, placing seventh in the all-around5 and third on 
balance beam and 
floor exercise at that year's National Championships.6 However, at the Olympic Trials she placed eighth and did not qualify for the Olympic squad. Bela and Marta Karolyi and many other gymnastics insiders protested this turn of events, claiming that U.S. judges deliberately underscored Grivich to keep the team from having too many Karolyi club gymnasts.7


Grivich retired from gymnastics after the Olympics. In 1993 she switched her focus to 
diving. After only two years in the sport, she earned a scholarship to the 

University of Houston
. She excelled in 

NCAA
 competition and hoped to eventually make the U.S. Olympic team as a diver.89


Less than a month before her twentieth birthday, Grivich was killed in an early morning car accident on a Houston 
highway. A scholarship with the 
Strake Jesuit Scholarship Fund was established in her name.10 In addition, Grivich's diving club, Woodlands Diving Academy, holds an annual elite meet in her honor, the Hilary Grivich Memorial Invitational.11

Tampa Bay Buccaneers coaches
Denver Broncos coaches




Larry Coyer is the 
defensive line coach for the 
NFL's 









Tampa Bay Buccaneers








.


Private life


A native of 
Greenbottom, West Virginia, Coyer was born in 

Huntington, West Virginia
. He and his wife, Jan, make their home in 

Aurora, Colorado
. Their son, Matt, was a member of an NCAA Champion soccer team at Indiana University. He and his wife Kristin are the parents of Coach Coyer and Jan's pride and joy, 4-year-old Rachel and 1-year-old Ryan. Larry's son, Justin, was an 





Iowa




 all-state football player in high school.


A 1964 graduate of 

Marshall University
, Coyer is a member of the Football Hall of Fame at Marshall for his achievements as a player. He began his coaching career at his alma mater in 1965 as secondary coach, a position he maintained through 1967. An additional coaching stint came at the acclaimed Massillon (Ohio) High School, where NFL Legend Paul Brown once coached.




Denver Broncos


Larry Coyer entered his seventh season on the Denver Broncos' coaching staff in 2006 and his fourth in the role of defensive coordinator. In his 42nd year of coaching on either the collegiate or professional level, Coyer began his Broncos coaching career as the club's linebackers coach from 2000-02 before he was promoted to defensive coordinator.


Coyer's defense consistently has ranked among the NFL's most productive during his three seasons as the Broncos' defensive coordinator and has helped the club advance to the playoffs each year. The Broncos have placed in the league's top-7 in run defense in every year under Coyer and have allowed an average of 93.3 rushing yards per game since 2003 to rank second in the NFL during that period.


Denver also has ranked among the league's best teams in overall defense under Coyer, posting consecutive top-4 NFL rankings in yards-per-game allowed from 2003-04 and placing fourth in the league (289.5 ypg.) in that category since 2003. In addition, the Broncos have surrendered an average of 18.0 points per game since 2003 to rank fifth in the NFL in scoring defense with Coyer at the helm. Coyer's defense was instrumental in the Broncos going 13-3 in 2005 and advancing to the AFC Championship Game. Denver, which sent cornerback Champ Bailey, safety John Lynch and linebacker Al Wilson to the Pro Bowl, ranked second in the NFL in run defense (85.2 ypg.) and posted the thirdbest such mark in franchise history. The Broncos allowed only 16.1 points per game to tie for third in the NFL and surrendered a total of 37 points in their final four games (9.3 ppg.) en route to capturing the AFC West title.



Coyer began his Broncos coaching career as their linebackers coach from 2000-02. In Coyer's first year instructing Denver's linebackers in 2000, John Mobley and fellow linebacker Bill Romanowski finished first and second on the team in tackles (133 and 121) while Wilson ranked fourth (104). 


Coyer wasted no time in making a positive impact in his first year as the Broncos' defensive coordinator in 2003. Denver's defense allowed an average of only 277.1 yards per game under Coyer's direction to rank fourth in the NFL and help the team to its first postseason berth since 2000. Coyer, who also instructed the team's linebackers, worked closely with Wilson during his Pro Bowl season that saw him lead the Broncos in tackles (128) for the second consecutive year.


In 2004, Coyer's defense featured two Pro Bowl selections in Lynch and Bailey, who also earned the first All-Pro nomination of his career after joining the Broncos in an offseason trade. Coyer aided in the development of rookie linebacker D.J. Williams, who became only the second Broncos rookie and the first in 32 years to lead the team in tackles (114). Along the way, Williams was the only 2004 rookie to be named AFC Defensive Player of the Week (Wk. 16) and finished No. 3 in the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year voting.


On 
January 8 
2007, Larry Coyer was released from the Denver Broncos after the 2006 season.  His release was the result of a defensive meltdown in the second half of the season. On 
January 18, 
2007 the Bucs hired him as their defensive line coach.1




USFL coaching



Coyer's other professional coaching experience came in the United States Football League as linebackers coach with the Michigan Panthers (1983-84) and defensive coordinator with the Memphis Showboats (1985-86). Coyer helped Michigan capture the inaugural USFL championship in 1983 with a win against Philadelphia in a game played at Mile High Stadium in Denver.




NCAA coaching



Coyer was the defensive coordinator in 1993 at East Carolina University, where under his guidance the Pirates improved in virtually every defensive category. He also served as defensive backs coach at Ohio State (1991-92), assistant head coach/defensive backs coach at the University of Houston (1990) and linebackers coach at UCLA (1987-89). Before his stint in the USFL, Coyer was defensive coordinator at Iowa State (1979-82), Oklahoma State University (1978) and the University of Iowa (1974-77) after serving as defensive backs coach at Bowling Green (1968-73).


Before his stint at Pittsburgh, Coyer was defensive coordinator at Iowa State University for two seasons (1995-96). That post was preceded by a one-year assignment as defensive line coach for the New York Jets in 1994.
While at the University of Pittsburgh (1997-99) as its defensive coordinator, Coyer directed a defensive unit that showed significant improvement each season, culminating in a 1999 showing that included top-5 rankings in the Big East Conference in all major defensive statistical categories. Two of his standouts, safety Ramon Walker and defensive lineman Demond Gibson, earned All-Big East Conference honors that season. In 1998, the Panthers ranked third in the Big East in total defense, and over the course of the 1997-98 seasons, the unit amassed 62 sacks, the highest two-season total at Pittsburgh since 1990-91.

Haruhi Fujioka

, a scholarship student at Ouran High School, and the other members of the titular

cliches and 
stereotypes that endure in series

audio dramas, an 
animated television series directed by 







Takuya Igarashi

Plot





Haruhi Fujioka

 is a scholarship student at Ouran High School, a fictional school located in 
Bunky , Tokyo. Because of the superlative cost of the school uniform, Haruhi resorts to wearing long slacks, polo shirts and vests. Combined with her large glasses and tousled short hair, Haruhi's look causes her to be confused for a boy.


Looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi stumbles upon the Third Music Room, the working place of the Ouran Host Club, a group of six extremely attractive male students (Takashi Morinozuka, called  Mori ;  Mitsukuni Haninozuka, called  Honey ; twins Kaoru and Hikaru Hitachiin; Tamaki Suou, and  Kyoya Ootori) who spend their time charming and entertaining the school's girls for profit. During their first meeting, Haruhi accidentally knocks over and breaks a vase valued at 

 
8,000,000, estimated to be 

US$
80,000.


In order to pay off the large debt, Haruhi is employed as the club's  dog  and is constantly ordered to do menial tasks like serving food or cleaning up. The club president, Tamaki Suou, without knowing she is really a girl, promotes Haruhi to  host  as soon as he discovers her potential. Even after the truth comes out in the Club, Haruhi continues the charade and is allowed to pay off the rest of her debt working as a host; in order to accomplish this, Haruhi conceals her true identity/gender from the customers and the school.

List of Ouran High School Host Club characters

The Ouran Private Academy encompasses kindergarten to twelfth grade. Most students come from wealthy families but, in rare occasions, special scholarships are granted to students from a lower income bracket. The school's unofficial motto is  Lineage counts first, wealth a close second,  meaning students with stellar family backgrounds are given top priority over those from rich families but low social status.



Host Club

Tamaki thought up the 
Host Club while in eighth grade and started it upon entering the Ouran High School. The members of the Host Club are highest ranking students at the school.  At Ouran High School, class is determined by lineage and intelligence ( A  is the highest class and  D  the lowest usually consisting of the kids of Yakuza leaders).  All the members are in class A and tend to be number one or two in their class coming from the wealthiest families in Japan with the exception of the twins and Haruhi.  The twins are ranked fourth and fifth in their class and Haruhi is a scholarship student receiving the special privilege of being in class A due to her scholarship status (she is ranked number one in her year).


Customers have the freedom to choose which host will entertain them, playing to their specific needs and interests. The Third Music Room has been outfitted by the Club to accommodate their business and, sometimes, it has a specific theme, ranging from a tropical paradise to a traditional picnic, to heighten the customers' pleasure and keep things interesting. The members of the club include:








Haruhi Fujioka

: Haruhi is the 
androgynous heroine of the story and the Natural type.  She comes from a lower-class family, but is very intelligent, so she is a scholarship student at Ouran.  Her mother died when she was five years old and so her cross-dressing father raises her on his own.  She is a seemingly apathetic and reluctant heroine who has no interest in pretty and flashy things, sweet food, or frivolous males.  The members of the Host Club all have a sort of weakness for her and either openly or secretly adore her. Haruhi appears as if she doesn't care about the host club member's feelings; however, she actually studies each and every one of them individually and cares for them all very much. The twins begin to realize that Haruhi appears to care more about Tamaki than she seems to demonstrate, which has caused some conflict. Haruhi soon realizes she has feelings for Tamaki, and confesses them to Mei.








Tamaki Suoh: The president of the Host club and the Prince type. He is extremely passionate and kind, always ready to help people, and has an interest in many things. He is considered the most attractive of the hosts, very intelligent (2nd in his class behind Kyoya), and a gifted piano player. He is very sincere in what he says, and takes his role to please girls very seriously, which stems from his deep love of his mother. However, the other club members recognize him as an idiot most of the time because he is very dense about his own situations (though perceptive about others), very silly and melodramatic at times, and somewhat selfish and narcissistic. He also has an odd obsession for the  commoner's lifestyle  and loves 
ramen and 
instant coffee (considered  commoner food ). He considers the Host Club to be a family and named himself father and Kyoya as the mother. His father is the superintendent of Ouran High School and his family is one of the wealthiest in Japan. His mother was forced to leave him so he would hopefully one day be recognized as the heir of the Suoh family by his grandmother, who does not like him. Tamaki is half-French and half-Japanese. He later discovers he possesses feelings for Haruhi that he is unable to decipher, still thinking them as family.








Kyoya Ootori: The vice president of the Host club and the Cool type. He is often called  Mother  by Tamaki and  Shadow King  by the rest of the club. He is behind most of the Host Club schemes and the other club members tend to go along with whatever Kyoya says, sometimes even favoring his leadership over Tamaki's. Despite their opposite personalities, Kyoya and Tamaki have been best friends since their last year of middle school, when Tamaki transferred to Ouran. He is a third son and has spent his whole life honoring his family name and yielding his true abilities so as to not overshadow his brothers; however, it is clear that Kyoya has more ambition, drive, and talent than both of them.  He also manages most of the finances with the club and has a habit of not revealing important information to the other hosts until the problem at hand is already over.
















Hikaru Hitachiin







 and 








Kaoru Hitachiin







: Identical twins who used to reject others and the Little Devil types. Only recently after they joined the Host Club did they start to open up and allow other people into their world. They are the same age as Haruhi and are in her class, and so have a special bond with her; Haruhi is the first and only person who is able to tell the twins apart, something that both had secretly longed for.  They enjoy playing  games  and tricks on classmates, especially Tamaki. Kaoru is nicer, more sensitive, and more mature than Hikaru. Hikaru, on the other hand, is very immature and somewhat mean, but mostly because he has trouble expressing his feelings. The twins later on discover that they too harbor feelings for Haruhi. Kaoru doesn't love Haruhi enough to want her only for himself (because he values his relationship with his brother more), so he ends up letting Hikaru be the twin who loves her romantically.















Mitsukuni Haninozuka






: Also known as  Honey  and the Loli-Shota type. He looks like an elementary school child rather than the 18-year-old third-year student he actually is. Honey is obsessed with sweets and anything cute, much like his youthful appearance would dictate. Honey carries a plush bunny (called  Usa-chan ) around with him as well as a bunny blanket. Despite his childish looks, he is deceptively strong and highly skilled in martial arts. He is usually found with Mori, his cousin by marriage. Honey comes from a family that owns a nationally-renown dojo and are known for their martial arts abilities. In one episode it was said if his full combat abilities were unleashed, he would be considered a threat to national security. Though it appears to be a facade, his cute side and serious side are both very real. After Tamaki explains to him that being himself is  true strength,  he resolves never to change.










Takashi Morinozuka

: Also known as  Mori  and the Wild type. He is the tall, stoic character.  Mori dedicates his life to Honey by protecting him and only gets angry when Honey is injured or harmed. However, he is also very close with the other club members and many classmates look up to him because of his quiet but gentle nature. He usually only speaks when he deems it necessary, and responds to questions mostly with monosyllabic answers. Mori's family has served Honey's family for years, until a marriage two generations ago made them cousins. Even though the servant-master bond was technically broken, Mori still serves faithfully as Honey's guardian and best friend.






Black Magic Club





The Dark Magic Clubroom



The 
Dark Magic Club is led by Umehito Nekozawa, a third year student. The club members seem to spend most of their time in a dimly-lit room poring over witchcraft paraphernalia, but the Club President insists they are performing a 
Black Mass. Each member wears a black coat and is provided their own free Beelzenef cat-puppet.


In the anime, Nekozawa is the only member shown and it is unknown if he managed to recruit anyone into his club. The initially strained relationship with his sister is focused on as well as his love for scary things. However, it is shown in the manga (in volume ten and the Halloween story) that there are four other members, including Reiko Kanazuki, who has developed a crush on Mitsukuni Haninozuka.




Newspaper Club





The Newspaper Club



The Newspaper Club is made up by its 
Chairman Akira Komatsuzawa, Chikage Ukyo and Tomochika Sakyo. The Club strives to be more popular than the Host Club, but their newsletter is a sensational, gossip-filled 
tabloid that no one bothers to read.



The Zuka Club performing on stage







Zuka Club


The White Lily Group, otherwise known as the Zuka Club (   , Zukabu) in honor of the 







Takarazuka Revue






, is Ouran Host Club's counterpart at St. Lobelia Girls Academy. The leading body, composed of second-year student Benio Amakusa  Benibara , second-year student Chizuru Maihara  Suzuran , and first-year student Hinako Tsuwabuki  Hinagiku , have gained 






idol status





 at St. Lobelia; Benio, particularly, is the subject of extreme affection from her fellow students, requiring her own student security agents. The group is a strong advocate of female superiority. Besides theatric performances, the club hosts a wide range of activities, such as tea ceremonies and discussion groups. The club's official name is a reference to the Japanese term 
yuri, which literally means  lily  and is used to describe lesbian situations in anime and manga.


This group has a strong antagonistic relationship with the Ouran Host Club, with them often fighting over Haruhi.




American Football Club


The 
American Football Club consists of Captain Takeshi Kuze, Vice-captain Makoto Togoin and Hayato Tarumi. Kuze's family controls the largest domestic share of fruit and vegetable imports. The team is called the Ouran Orage, which rhymes with  orange  and is French for  storm . The American Football Club only appears in the manga. It is shown that the captain, Takeshi Kuze holds some sort of grudge against Kyouya. The grudge apparently comes from when they were very young, and Kyouya contradicted Kuze's knowledge on the nutritional value of oranges (and their peels).




Karate Club


Hunny was the captain of the Karate Club before joining the Host Club in his second year of high school. As captain, Hunny was strict and hard on the students, in an attempt to purge the cuteness from himself. The current captain is Hunny's stricter, younger brother 
Yasuchika Haninozuka.




Visual Arts Club


Not much is known about this club, apart from that their works are featured on the Ouran Gondola.




Gardening Club



A club that cultivates the plants and gardens in Ouran's grounds. Kasanoda is in this club, and is always growing crops for Haruhi. In the manga, they found a treasure map and presented it to the Host Club. This lead to the finding of a Hot Spring on the grounds, that only lasted for one day before mysteriously disappearing.




Classical Music Club


Two members of this club feature in the story. Shir  Taka ji, along with his crush who is set to move to Germany. Apparently, the club performs large concert pieces, however none of these are actually seen in the manga or the anime.

 A laurel wreath decorating a memorial at the 

Folketing
, the national parliament of Denmark.




A laurel wreath is a circular 
wreath made of interlocking branches and leaves of the 
Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis, 
Lauraceae), an aromatic broadleaf evergreen. In 
Greek mythology, 

Apollo
 is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head. In 
ancient Greece wreaths were awarded to victors, both in athletic competitions, including the ancient 








Olympics







, and in poetic meets; in 
Rome they were symbols of martial victory, crowning a successful commander during his 



triumph


. Whereas ancient laurel wreaths are most often depicted as a 
horseshoe shape, modern versions are usually complete rings.


In common modern 
idiomatic usage it refers to a victory.  The expression  resting on one's laurels  refers to someone relying on their past success to cover up their current inadequacies.  



 Academic use 


Some countries the laurel wreath is used as symbol of the 
master's degree. The wreath is given to young masters in the 
graduation ceremony of the university. The word  
Laureate  in '
poet laureate' refers to being signified by the laurel wreath.  The medieval Florentine poet and philosopher 





Dante Alighieri




, a graduate of the 








Sicilian School







, is often represented in paintings and sculpture wearing a laurel wreath.


At 

Connecticut College
 members of the junior class carry a laurel 
chain, which the seniors pass through during Commencement. It represents nature and the continuation of life from year to year. Immediately following commencement, the junior girls write out with the laurels their class year, symbolizing they have officially become seniors and the cycle will repeat itself the following spring.


At 

Reed College
 members of the senior class receive laurel wreaths upon submitting their senior 
thesis in May. The tradition stems from the use of laurel wreaths in athletic competitions; the seniors have  crossed the finish line,  so to speak.




Architectural and decorative arts motif


The laurel wreath is a common motif in architecture, furniture, and textiles. The laurel wreath is seen carved in stone and decorative plaster work of 

Robert Adam
, 
Federal,  
Regency, 
Directoire, and 


Beaux-Arts

 periods of architecture. In decorative arts, especially during the 
Empire period, the laurel wreath is seen woven in textiles, inlaid in marquetry, and applied to furniture in the form of gilded brass mounts. 

Alfa Romeo
 added a laurel wreath to their 
logo after they won the inaugural Automobile World Championship in 1925 with the 




P2



 racing car.

Weishan Liu (   ) is a 
guzheng master performer, composer and educator. 

She was born in 
China and began training in the classical style of the guzheng from the age of eleven when the acclaimed guzheng master Cao Zheng (1920-1998) picked her as his student at the 

Shenyang
 Music Conservatory. She later also studied under Yan Li and Zhao Yuzhai. 


Her breakthrough came at the 1974 Chinese national traditional music competition where, playing her original composition The Magnificent Bronze Gorge, she won first prizes in both the composition and performance categories. She went on to become the top guzheng soloist at the Central Song and Dance Ensemble of China, making recordings and performing and touring with them, as well as often performing for visiting heads of state. 


Liu moved to the 








United States







 in 1982 and continued performing her unique style of guzheng music. She has performed with the Chinese Orchestras of 

Berkeley
 and 
Los Angeles, as well as with the Bay Area Women s Philharmonic Orchestra, the Palo Alto Philharmonic Orchestra, and she has performed composer Chen Yi s modern compositions with the ensemble Earplay. She was a pioneer in the teaching of guzheng overseas. Over the past two decades she has trained well over a thousand students, many of whom have become professional performers and teachers themselves. She also founded the 
San Francisco Guzheng Music Society to promote the music of the guzheng and traditional Chinese music and culture. This organization conducts many community concerts and educational programs, including an annual concert in San Francisco with a different theme every year, and it frequently invites Chinese and Western musicians to showcase their talents. 


In 1988, Liu made her first solo guzheng recording, The Magnificent Bronze Gorge, featuring the title song, her signature composition. She also recorded an ensemble album with the Dun Huang Music Ensemble in 1994 titled High Moon. She made three more ensemble recordings in 1994 for the Wind Record Company: Masterpieces of Chinese Songs of the 30s, Masterpieces of Chinese Folksongs, and Masterpieces of Chinese Traditional Music. She has participated in other recordings as well. Liu has also lent her expertise to recording soundtracks for films such as Thousand Pieces of Gold, Indiana Jones   the Temple of Doom, Dim Sum, Eat A Bowl of Tea, Five Chinese Brothers, The Round Eyes in the Twentieth Century, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, and Motherland. In 2005, she recorded an arrangement of some of the Thousand Pieces of Gold themes with pianist 
George Winston for the album Cinema: A Windham Hill Collection.


Liu has toured the United States as well as more than 20 countries. She has recently started extensively recording her solo repertoire and new solo arrangements and compositions. Her new solo CD, Morning Bell, was released in April 2006.

Robert Martin Luther Bailey (born

American football 
cornerback who played eleven seasons for six teams, the 









Los Angeles Rams








, the 









Dallas Cowboys








, the

, the

, and the 









Baltimore Ravens








 from 1991 to 2001 in the

.


Bailey played 
college football at the 

University of Miami
 and was drafted in the fourth round of the 
1991 NFL Draft by the Rams.
http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Robert_Bailey#endnote_draft


He was nicknamed  beetle  after comic strip character 

Beetle Bailey
.


On 
October 23, 
1994 as a member with the Rams, Bailey made the longest punt return in NFL history when he ran 103 yards for a touchdown in a game against the 









New Orleans Saints








.
http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Robert_Bailey#endnote_punt What makes this return stand out is that every single player on the field assumed the ball was going to bounce through the end zone after the punt.  Everyone, that is, except Bailey, who was the only person to see that the ball never bounced out of the end zone and was lying in the end zone still in play.  He ran up, scooped the ball up, and returned it for a touchdown before anyone realized what had happened.


A broken neck against the 











Green Bay Packers










 ended Bailey's career in 2001.

, 
Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) is a 

Serbia
n philosopher. In the 1960s and 1970s he gained prominence as a proponent of the 
Praxis School, a 
Marxist humanist movement that originated in 
SFRY. A co-author of the 
SANU Memorandum, during late 80s and 90s he was a prominent supporter of 
Slobodan Milo evi .


Early life


Markovi  became a member of the youth organization of the 
Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) in 1940, and in 1944 he became a member of the CPY itself. He actively participated in the struggle for liberation of 





Yugoslavia




 during 







World War II






.  




Academic career


Markovi  took his PhD in philosophy first at the 

University of Belgrade
 and then in London at University College, where he studied 
logic under 
A.J. Ayer, and wrote his thesis on The Concept of Logic. He became a professor of philosophy at the Faculty of Philosophy in the University of Belgrade, and the dean of the faculty in the period 1966 1967. From 1960 to 1962 he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Philosophy. In the 1970s, he taught at the 
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was a director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade. Markovi  was a co-Chairman of the 
International Humanist and Ethical Union (1975 1985). In his honour, a collection of articles entitled Philosophy and Society was published in Belgrade in 1987.


He has been a corresponding member of the 
Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1963 and a full member since 1983.




Social critic


After the Resolution of the 
Informbiro condemning the Yugoslav communist regime, Markovi  took part in a fierce debate against 
Stalinist dogmatism, becoming one of the fiercest critics of the Stalinist philosophical theses. His Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR, published in 1952, was the first major attack on the Stalinist philosophy in Yugoslavia.


In the 1960s Markovi  became a major proponent of the 
Praxis School of Marxist interpretation, which emphasized the writings of young Marx, and their dialectical and humanist aspects in particular. He also actively contributed to the international journal Praxis. Due to his critical observations, together with seven other professors from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade, Markovi  was suspended in January 1975, and finally lost his job in January 1981. After that, Markovi  worked in the Institute of Social Research until his retirement in 1986.




The Memorandum



As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1986 Markovi , together with 
Vasilije Krestic and others, wrote the  Memorandum of the SANU , a document that has formulated the central tenets of Serbian nationalism. While outside of Serbia, the document has been viewed as a preparation for full scale Greater Serbian expansionism, many Serbs consider it to realistically depict the position of Serbia in the Yugoslav federation.




SPS



He was a vice president of the 
Slobodan Milo evi 's 

Socialist Party of Serbia
 until 1995 and its one time chief ideologue. At other times, he was a vocal critic of the official SPS party line.

Surgery




Inguinal orchiectomy is a relatively minor 
surgical procedure to remove a 
testicle.  The procedure is generally performed by a 
urologist. Often it is performed as same-day surgery, with the patient returning home within hours of the procedure. Some patients elect to have a prosthetic testicle inserted into their 
scrotum.

A 6cm incision is made above the 
pubic bone on the side corresponding to the testicle to be removed. The testicle is then pulled up through the 
inguinal canal, the 
spermatic cord is clamped off in two places and cut between the clamps.


The inguinal orchiectomy is a necessary procedure if 
testicular cancer is suspected.


If the orchiectomy is performed to diagnose cancer, the testicle and spermatic cord are then sent to a 
pathologist to determine the makeup of the 
tumor, and the extent of spread within the testicle and cord.


The pathology report, along with pre-surgical imaging studies and 
tumor markers, will determine the course of treatment.

Hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis

Hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis is a 
genetic disorder which occurs in both humans and horses.  It is characterized by muscle hyperexcitability or weakness which, exacerbated by 
potassium or cold,  can lead to uncontrolled shaking followed by 
paralysis.  Onset in humans usually occurs in the twenties.

The 
mutation which causes this disorder is 
 dominant with linkage to the

sodium channel expressed in 
muscle (called SCN4A).  In the presence of high potassium levels, sodium channels fail to activate properly.  The mutation causes single 
amino acid changes in parts of the channel which important for inactivation.


Equine hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis occurs in 1 in 50 
quarter horses and can be traced to a
single ancestor (A stallion named Impressive).  Episodes in these horses are commonly brought on by 
alfalfa, which contains high levels of potassium.

I Am Ghost is an 
American 
post-hardcore band from 

Long Beach, California
, conceived of and founded by Steven Juliano in 2004. They are signed to 

Epitaph Records
. 



 History 


Singer and graphic artist Steve Juliano utilized his knowledge of  
Myspace to attract prospective members to I Am Ghost.  Seeking musicians that could bring his provocative, often dark lyrics to life, Juliano succeeded in forming a band that included lead guitarist 
Timoteo Rosales III; rhythm guitarist Gabe Iraheta; violinist Kerith Telestai and her husband, bassist Brian Telestai. Drummer 

Victor Angel Camarena
 was also in this lineup of the band, but quickly determined that their sound did not appeal to him. He was replaced by 
Ryan Seaman.


The band recorded a demo EP for 

Epitaph Records
, entitled 

We Are Always Searching
. Impressed by the EP, Epitaph issued the band's first full length album 

Lovers' Requiem
 in October 10, 2006.  Juliano explains,  It s essentially a rock opera, but for hardcore or 
Goth kids. 1


I Am Ghost has attracted attention in the music press, including a 
Metal Hammer Interview. They have been featured on several 
punk and 
alternative rock websites, and been favorably reviewed in several UK music magazines.  

Metal Hammer
 magazine named I Am Ghost on its  Dead Hot 50 Bands of 2006 
List. 


I Am Ghost toured with 


Biffy Clyro

, 
TheAUDITION and 

The Bronx
 on the 

Kerrang!
 Tour 2007, the Epitaph Tour 2007 with 


Escape the Fate

, 

The Matches
, and 

The Higher
, the Take Action Tour in 2006, and played on 









Warped Tour 2006








 and 









Warped Tour 2007








.


Band violinist Kerith Telestai released an official statement on June 30, 2007, stating that she would be unable to continue touring and would be leaving I Am Ghost due to health reasons. A few days after Kerith's departure, her husband, 






Brian Telestai





, announced that he too would be leaving the band after their tour with 


Aiden

. 


According to Juliano, there was a conflict among the remaining members of I Am Ghost and the Telestais, concerning the direction of I Am Ghost.  Juliano believes that this conflict was the true reason for the departure of both Kerith and Brian. The remaining members of the band explained that the Telestais were such devoted 
Christians, that they would describe I Am Ghost as a 





Christian rock




 band during interviews.  Juliano went on to say that Kerith would edit song lyrics, and insist the band never swear. At one point she cried in a tour van for almost 30 minutes, after Juliano used the word  fuck  on stage.2 By the end of 2007,  bassist/vocalist 
Ron Ficarro was invited to join the band and replace Brian Telestai; no mention was made of replacing Kerith Telestai. It is believed that drummer Ryan Seaman suggested the road-ready Ficarro as Brian Telestai's replacement, though Seaman himself quit the band for unknown reasons, just as Ficarro arrived.




 Those We Leave Behind (Early 2008-Present) 


I Am Ghost posted a teaser for their second full length album on 
Youtube, that contains a demo of a new song called  My Beautiful . This song has a female voice singing in the background, which presumably is not Kerith Telestai.  The song teaser is also featured on the MySpace page of Electronic/Industrial act Chamber of Echoes, but there is no explicit evidence of any collaboration between Chamber of Echoes singer Klaryssa Korol and I Am Ghost.


Upon the release of the song on MySpace, messages to MySpace friends of I Am Ghost from Steven Juliano asked that I Am Ghost fans add Chamber of Echoes using the site's Friend feature.  Again, Juliano made no mention of collaboration between the two bands.


On January 25, 2008, at the Chain Reaction club in Anaheim, CA, Klaryssa appeared onstage and played keyboards with I Am Ghost on a few  songs. Portions of this show were filmed for the upcoming music video,  Pretty People Never Lie, Vampires Never Really Die .


In mid-February, Juliano tapped Justin McCarthy, a former colleague from a band called The Silence, to be I Am Ghost's new drummer. 


Due to creative differences, rhythm guitarist Gabe Iraheta left I Am Ghost  in May 2008.  Iraheta is now working with a band called The Arkham Dream. 


On the band's 'Til Death Do Us Part tour, I Am Ghost debuted  Chad Kulengosky as its new rhythm guitarist.  Chad was recruited on the advice of drummer McCarthy. 


I Am Ghost posted a bulletin on their 

MySpace
 page on August 3, 2008 stating its new album will be released on October 7, 2008.
The bulletin stated that there would be 14 tracks on the new album and that  a CD release show would take place on October 12 at The Glass House in 




Pomona, California



. On August 5, 2008, I Am Ghost posted the album artwork and title for their new album,  Those We Leave Behind .


On August 12, 2008, the band posted the song  Bone Garden  and accompanying lyrics on their MySpace page.

Musical groups by numbers




In 
music, an octet is a 
musical ensemble consisting of eight 
instruments or voices, or a musical composition written for such an ensemble.


Octets in classical music


Octets in 
classical music are one of the largest groupings of 
chamber music. They tend to be scored in one of the following arrangements:





 String Octet - This arrangement is made up entirely of strings. 

Felix Mendelssohn
's 
Octet Op. 20 is an example, as is the string octet by 

Dmitri Shostakovich
.


 Double quartet - Double quartets are made up of two 
string quartets, often arranged 
antiphonally. 







Louis Spohr






 composed such octets, as did 











George Enescu










.


 Wind Octet - Usually scored for 2 
oboes, 2 
clarinets, 2 
horns, and 2 
bassoons; 
Mozart and 
Beethoven composed in this genre. 

Igor Stravinsky
's wind octet is in an unusual grouping of 
flute, clarinet, two bassoons, two 
trumpets, and two 
trombones.


 Wind and String Octet - a combination of forces, popularized by 

Franz Schubert
 (whose 
Octet is for clarinet, bassoon, 

horn
, 
violins, 
viola, 
cello, and 
double bass).   

Paul Hindemith
 wrote a less well known piece for clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, two violas, cello and double bass.






Octets in jazz


Jazz ensembles of eight players will frequently be termed an octet. These ensembles may be for any combination of instruments. 


Ornette Coleman

's ensemble for the  album (referred to as a double quartet) is one such example.


Saxophonist 

David Murray
 leads a famous experimental jazz octet, the David Murray Octet.




Vocal octet


A vocal octet is a choir, or performance by a choir, of eight separate parts, for example, an SSAATTBB (1st   2nd 
Soprano, 1st   2nd 
Alto, 1st   2nd 
Tenor, 
Baritone, and 




Bass



) choir.

Power engineering




Power system protection is that part of electrical 
power engineering that deals with protecting the electrical power system from faults by isolating the faulted part from the rest of the network.

The main objective of a protection scheme is to keep the power system stable by isolating only the components that are under fault, whilst leaving as much of the network as possible still in operation.  Thus, protection schemes must apply a very 
pragmatic and pessimistic approach to clearing system faults.  For this reason, the technology and philosophies utilized in protection schemes are often old and well-established because they must be very reliable.


Protection systems usually comprise five components:




Current and 
voltage transformers to step down the high voltages and currents of the electrical power system to convenient levels for the relays to deal with;



Relays to sense the fault and intiate a trip, or disconnection, order;



Circuit breakers to open/close the system based on relay and autorecloser commands;






Batteries


 to provide power in case of power disconnection in the system.


Communication channels to allow analysis of current and voltage at remote terminals of a line and to allow remote tripping of equipment.


For parts of a distribution system, 




fuses



 are capable of both sensing and disconnecting 
faults.

October 23, 1871 (aged 45)

Alexander Nikolayevich Afanasyev

July 11, 1826(1826-07-11)





Alexander Nikolayevich Afanasyev (

Russian
:                               ) (
11 July, 
1826   
23 October, 
1871) was a 

Russia
n 
folklorist who recorded and published over 600 Russian 
folktales and 
fairytales, by far the largest folktale collection by any one man in the world.1 His first collection was published in eight volumes from 1855-67, earning him the reputation of a Russian counterpart to the 

Brothers Grimm
. 



Life



He was educated at a gymnasium in 

Voronezh
 and studied law at 
Moscow university 2, in which he attended the lectures of 











Konstantin Kavelin










 and 






Timofey Granovsky





. His burgeoning career as a professor of history was cut short by denounciation of his work on the part of 







Sergey Uvarov






. He then turned his attention to journalism and brought out a series of articles about leading personalities of the literary life of the previous century, including 













Nikolay Novikov












, 






Denis Fonvizin





, and 
Antiokh Kantemir. 


Censured by the authorities for his contacts with 
Herzen and suffering from 
tuberculosis, Afanasyev ended his life in penury, forced to sell his library to enable himself to eat.3 He died in 

Moscow
 aged 45.




Work



Afanasyev collected many Russian folk tales throughout the course of his career. He is said to have become acquainted with folktales from local women in his home town of 
Bobrov. He genuinely hoped that the revival of the native Russian fairy tales would promote the triumph of the Russian language over the 

French language
, which had been adopted by the Russian aristocracy. 


It was in the 1850s that Afanasiev found his vocation in folklore studies. His first scholarly articles - The Wizards and Witches, Sorcery in the Ancient Rus, Pagan Legends about the 


Buyan

 Island - drew heavily upon the so-called Mythological school that treated folklore as a mine of information for the study of more ancient pagan mythology. His definitive work on the subject - The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs - was published in three volumes between 1865 and 1869.  In such an interpretation, he regarded the fairy tale 
Vasilissa the Beautiful as depicting the conflict between the sunlight (Vasilissa), the storm (her stepmother), and dark clouds (her stepsisters).4


In the course of his studies of the 
Russian folklore Afanasyev amassed a collection of more than 600 Russian folktales - some of them contributed by 
Vladimir Dahl, others taken from the archives of the 



Russian Geographical Society


 and grouped by Afanasiev according to their themes, imagery, and style. He owes his prominent place in the history of Slavonic philology chiefly to 




Narodnye russkie skazki



 (Russian Fairy Tales), eight volumes modelled on the famous collection of the 

Brothers Grimm
 and published between 1855 and 1863.  


Afanasyev edited several other compilations which included: Russian Fairy Tales for Children comprising a set of animal, magic and humorous tales from his collection that were suitable to children; Russian Folk Legends which was banned due to the harsh censorship in Tsarist Russia (the church thought the collection was blasphemous); and Russian Forbidden Tales, an assortment of unprintable tales from Russia that had to be published in Switzerland anonymously.5  Their obscene and anticlerical subject matter made their publication in Imperial Russia unthinkable.6




 Significance 


Prior to Afanasyev's works in the 1850s, only a few attempts had ever been made to record or study the folk beliefs of peasant Russia. Though a written Russian language (
Church Slavonic) had existed since the 10th century, it was used almost solely by the church and only for parochial written works. It was not until the 18th and 19th centuries that a sizable body of secular literature developed in the vernacular Russian. Thus, Afanasyev's collections made a highly valuable contribution to the dissemination and legitimization of Russian culture and folk belief. The influence of these folk tales can be seen in the works of many writers and composers, notably 
Rimsky-Korsakov (






Sadko





, 






The Snow Maiden





) and 
Stravinsky (

The Firebird
, 

Petrushka
). 7

Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals of the Universties of the United Kingdom
 1976-77, the Advisory Group on London Health Services 1980-81,2 and the 
Oxfordshire District Health Authority 1981-4.

The first Green Lantern to appear in comic books is not a member of the Green Lantern Corps, but instead the inheritor of a mystic power (later established to be the Starheart, a sentient concentration of magical energy). Alan Scott, a civil engineer, discovers a mysterious, magical train lantern, and, with instructions from a voice emanating from the stone, forges part of its metal into a green ring. This ring gives him a variety of different powers, and Scott adopts a costume and the name of Green Lantern. As Green Lantern, he fights crime, and helps found the 

Justice Society of America
. Scott still appears in 

DC
 comics as Green Lantern, having retaken the name after a brief period of using the name Sentinel.




Hal Jordan, the Silver Age Green Lantern





Main article: 


Hal Jordan




The second Green Lantern is Harold 'Hal' Jordan, who is a second-generation 
test pilot (following in the footsteps of his father, Martin Jordan) who is given the power ring and battery (lantern) by a dying 
alien named 
Abin Sur. When Abin Sur's 
spaceship crashes on 
Earth, the alien uses his ring to seek out an individual to take his place as Green Lantern: someone who is  utterly honest and born without fear.  Hal is a founding member of the 
Justice League of America.


Hal Jordan later destroys the 

Green Lantern Corps
 and 








Guardians of the Universe







 (save for 
Ganthet) and adopts the name 
Parallax. He is defeated by a gathering of heroes (in the 















Zero Hour














 miniseries), and later sacrifices himself to reignite Earth's sun (in the 
Final Night storyline). His soul becomes a guide for the 











Spectre










, but he is later revived by Ganthet when (in a 
retcon) it is discovered that Jordan's actions as Parallax were caused by his possession by a fear elemental (also known as Parallax). Hal Jordan has returned to his role as Green Lantern, and is operating in the rebuilt 








Coast City







. In 2007, both he and John Stewart are the titular Green Lanterns of Green Lantern.




Guy Gardner, the Honor Guard Green Lantern





Main article: 






Guy Gardner (comics)








Guy Gardner (Earth's Green Lantern IV) is a former school teacher whom Abin Sur's ring selected as an alternative to Hal Jordan, but Jordan was closer so Sur chose him instead. Gardner later suffered 
brain damage, and was unbalanced when he recovered enough to function. He was awarded a ring by a rogue faction of Guardians during 

Crisis on Infinite Earths
. 


After losing a 1-on-1 fight with Hal Jordan, to see who would be the Green Lantern of the Earth Sector (2814), Gardner was forced to abandon his Green Lantern Ring. Guy acquired the yellow power ring of Sinestro and his own comic series began with him using that ring. The yellow ring did not use a battery to recharge but actually needed to be used against Green Lanterns to restore power. Gardner found this out by accident when a member of the GLC fought him while he had absolutely no power. 


As the yellow ring of Sinestro spoke Sinestro's native language, Guy was entirely unable to communicate with the ring, although it seemed to understand him to a degree. He served in 
Maxwell Lord's JLI until all Green Lantern rings lost their power when Kyle Rayner destroyed Oa in an effort to stop Parallax. Finding himself powerless, he went on a quest for a mythical source of power deep in the jungle. This power source activated dormant extraterrestrial DNA in him, providing him with the ability to morph his body into various different forms -- mainly in the form of weapons. He then adopted the identity of Warrior. 


Gardner has since been purged of his extraterrestrial DNA and is currently a Green Lantern once more, having risen to the rank of Honor Guard Lantern #1, now outranking all sector Lanterns and acting as a troubleshooter and advisor.




John Stewart, the JLA Green Lantern





Main article: 
John Stewart (comics)


John Stewart (Earth's Green Lantern III) is an architect who is Hal Jordan's backup after Gardner was seriously injured, and serves with the JLA on occasion. After Jordan gives up being Green Lantern in the 1980s, the Guardians call Stewart to full time duty as the sector's main Lantern. Stewart fills that role for some years, during which time he marries 
Katma Tui, the Green Lantern of the planet Korugar. After Tui's murder, Stewart becomes the administrator of the  
Mosaic World , a patchwork of communities from multiple planets that had been brought to Oa by an insane Guardian. From this position, Stewart eventually ascends to Guardianhood, which he later relinquishes. During the collapse of the Corps he is a member of the 





Darkstars




 where, at the hands of 





Grayven




, he suffers a brief period of 
paraplegia. He becomes Green Lantern once again and was a member of the latest incarnation of the JLA, before it disbanded during the events of 















Infinite Crisis














. Following the restoration of the Corps, John shares the duty of protecting Earth's sector with Hal Jordan.




Kyle Rayner, the Modern Age Green Lantern





Main article: 
Kyle Rayner


Kyle Rayner is a struggling freelance artist when he is approached by the last Guardian of the Universe, 
Ganthet, to become a new Green Lantern with the last power ring. For a period of time, Kyle Rayner is the only Green Lantern, but (after turning into a godlike being known as Ion) he reestablishes the Green Lantern Corps and revives the Guardians of the Universe. He returns to his mortal form and reclaims the Green Lantern name afterward, but after the death of his former girlfriend Jade, he once again transforms into Ion. After 
Ion (revealed as the embodiment of willpower) is cast away from him he was possessed by Parallax. The Earth Lanterns, led by Hal Jordan, were able to purge the Parallax entity from Kyle's body. Given a ring by the Guardian Ganthet, Kyle has once again taken the name Green Lantern. In 2007, both he and Guy Gardner are the titular Green Lanterns of Green Lantern Corps.





Other Green Lanterns of Earth's sector


With the exception of Yalan Gur, these other characters have served as Earth's Green Lantern and protector. 



Jade





Main article: 














Jade (comics)
















Jennie-Lynn Hayden, known also as Jade, is Alan Scott's daughter, and was born with innate Green Lantern-like powers. After she (temporarily) loses these innate powers, Kyle Rayner briefly bestows upon her a power ring and the title of Earth's Green Lantern. After becoming Ion, Kyle restores her inherent powers, which she had until her death during Infinite Crisis.




Vidar





Main article: 





Universo






In pre-















Zero Hour














 continuity, Vidar was a 30th century member of the 

Green Lantern Corps
 who was assigned to journey to the Time Institute on Earth, and prevent the 




Legion of Super-Heroes



 from viewing the Dawn of Time (an act which had catastrophic consequences when perpetuated eons earlier by the 

Maltus
ian scientist 
Krona).  When Vidar attempted to view the Dawn of Time himself, he was stripped of his ring by the 








Guardians of the Universe







 (making Vidar and 
Sinestro the only two renegade Green Lanterns in pre-

Crisis
 continuity).  Outraged by the aggressiveness of the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps throughout the incident, Earth's government banned all Green Lanterns from the planet.


Vidar would subsequently master the art of super-hypnotism and become 





Universo




, one of the Legion's most persistent enemies.




Rond Vidar





Main article: 
Rond Vidar

In pre-















Zero Hour














 continuity, Rond -- a 30th century resident of Earth -- was the son of 




Legion of Super-Heroes



 foe (and former Green Lantern) 





Universo




.  Sent to live with another family, Rond proved to be a genius at temporal theory, and won a prize at an early age for his invention of the Time Cube, a device which can transport its contents in 
time.  The Time Cube later proved indispensable to the Legion, who used it to stop Universo from conquering Earth.  


Rond continued his research, collaborating on many experiments with 
Brainiac 5, and eventually becoming an honorary member of the Legion.  While instrumental in many temporal advances, including the creation of the Time Beacon, allowing for safe travel through time, Rond's experiments took a disastrous turn when they threw Professor Jaxon Rugarth into a time loop, turning him into the 
Infinite Man.


At some point in Rond's career, the 








Guardians of the Universe







 recruited him to be a covert member of the 

Green Lantern Corps
, since Green Lanterns were banned on 
Earth. Rond kept this a secret, not even telling his friends in the Legion.  His membership in the Corps was revealed when he helped a group of Legionnaires survive a vengeance-inspired attack on the 
Time Trapper.


During the  Five Years Later  era of Legion continuity, his power ring was destroyed by the sorcerer 






Mordru





.




DC Comics
 writer Geoff Johns has confirmed that, in post-















Infinite Crisis














 continuity, Rond Vidar is one of only two Green Lanterns remaining in the 31st Century.1




Yalan Gur


Yalan Gur is a Green Lantern introduced (in Green Lantern Vol. 3 #19) as part of an effort to reconcile the Golden Age Green Lantern's origin with the later introduction of the Green Lantern Corps. He is a red-scaled, reptilian humanoid, assigned to sector 2814 (Earth's sector) in the 
10th Century AD.


While Alan Scott, along with the rest of the 

Justice Society of America
, is trapped in Limbo, his mystic lantern sends a projection to Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, and John Stewart (the Green Lanterns of Earth at the time). After tracing the projection to Scott's home, the lantern tells the story of its origin (effectively retconning the origin of Alan Scott's power.)


In the lantern's story, Yalan Gur was once one of the greatest of the Green Lantern Corps, and, in the 
10th Century AD by Earth reckoning, the Guardians of the Universe chose to remove the customary weakness to the color yellow from his power ring. Without this limitation, however, he was corrupted by his power, and he came to Earth and enslaved the people of 
China. The 








Guardians of the Universe







 thwarted Yalan by adding a new weakness to wood to his ring, which allowed the club-wielding villagers to overwhelm their oppressor and mortally wound him. The dying Yalan Gur fled into Earth's upper atmosphere, where he merged with his lantern-shaped power battery as he died. (His lantern then collided with a fragment of the Starheart and was merged with its magical essence, turning into the Green Flame that becomes the source of Alan Scott's power.)




Jong Li


Jong Li is a Green Lantern introduced in (Green Lantern, Dragon Lord), a limited series created by DC in 2001, written by Doug Moench and drawn by Paul Gulacy and Josef Rubinstein. He is actually Earth's first Green Lantern, and was a monk raised in the Temple of the Dragon Lords in 
China.


When Jong Li was growing up, he was taught of the Dragon Lords, beings who ruled in the  Golden Age  of man, and that under these lords, man prospered. He was taught to renounce all earthly possessions and to live a life of peace and discipline, but then one day a concubine named Jade Moon came to him in his temple, begging for help in trying to escape her bonds. Jong Li tried to help her but failed, and his temple and fellow monks were ravaged by the emperor's troops and their commander. 


Jong Li later encountered a Guardian who gave him a power ring and a lantern to  Oppose Evil, Ease Suffering and Protect the Innocent.  Jong Li later rescued Jade and learned of Lung Mountain, where the last Dragon Lords supposedly lived. He set out to seek their higher authority and with their Blessing of Fire became the last Dragon Lord of the Earth, finally defeating the evil emperor's forces and saving his people.




Abin Sur





Main article: 
Abin Sur


Abin Sur was a Green Lantern assigned Sector 2814 (Earth's sector, by the Green Lantern Corps' reckoning). His ship crash-landed on Earth and passed his ring on to Hal Jordan as he lay dying.





Alien Green Lanterns


While they are rarely the star of any of the Green Lantern comics, a number of alien members of the Green Lantern Corps have appeared in DC's various comics.



Arisia





Main article: 
Arisia (comics)

The teenage daughter of Fentara, Green Lantern of Graxos IV, Arisia was trained at an early age to follow in her father's footsteps. Upon Fentara's death Blish of neighboring Graxos V was named Green Lantern for Space Sector 2815. When Blish was killed, the 








Guardians of the Universe







 sought Arisia as the new Green Lantern. On her homeworld, Arisia took up the civilian identity of Cynella, making a name for herself as an artist and fashion designer. 


Arisia first met 


Hal Jordan

, neighboring Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814 on her way to 
Oa to take part in battle against 
Krona the renegade Guardian, and 
Nekron, Lord of the Unliving. She was astounded by the thousands of different Green Lanterns she fought beside, and was quick to make friends. Her life as an emerald warrior was about to be cut short when she was rescued by Tylot, one of Krona's army of the undead. For rescuing the young Lantern, Tylot was made a temporary Green Lantern.

Oa, but is killed when a yellow truck runs him over.




Driq


Driq of Criq was an undead humanoid from an unknown sector.  He was killed by 
Sinestro and 
Sentient Sector 3600, but his ring wouldn't allow his life force to escape his body.3  Thus, he remained in a not-quite-dead state, though his physical body exhibited signs of decomposition and his costume was ragged and tattered.3  When Sinestro was executed and all of the Green Lantern rings lost their power, Driq collapsed into a final death.




Eddore

Sentient Sector 3600.  Currently believed to be dead.




G'nort





Main article: 
 G'nort

G'nort Espalanade G'neesmacher, created by 

Keith Giffen
 and 

J. M. DeMatteis
, is an incompetent member of the Green Lantern Corps, incapable of accomplishing superheroic or even ordinary tasks. In this role, he is occasionally a member of unspectacular superhero teams (such as the 

Justice League Antarctica
 and the 
Super Buddies), and often serves as 
comic relief in various incarnations of the 

Justice League
 comics. Despite his incompetence and lack of intelligence, G'nort does his best to be brave, loyal, and honorable, a fact that has been noted by both 

Superman
 and the (fictional) 








Mayor of New York City







.


Upon his first appearance (during the 







Millennium






 crossover event), Hal Jordan stated that G'nort only got into the Corps through the political influence of his uncle, a respected Green Lantern.4 However, his incompetence was recognized early and he was given a completely lifeless Sector to patrol.4 This origin was slightly 
retconned in Green Lantern Vol. 3 #9-13. According to this new origin, G'nort and his uncle G'newman initially received their power rings from Poglachians, posing as the 








Guardians of the Universe







 after the real Guardians departed the universe with the 





Zamaron




s. This was part of a Paglachian/Weaponeers of 
Qward plot to arm incompetents with Green Lantern power rings; the Paglachians wanted to cause amusing chaos, while the Weaponeers wanted to discredit the Green Lantern Corps. Despite the initial origin of his ring, after the plot is uncovered 






Guy Gardner





, against his better judgment, nominated G'nort for genuine Corps membership.


G'nort has only appeared in supporting roles and back-up stories, either pestering the 

Justice League
 to let him join (or at least help with the latest threat to Earth) or battling wholly unintimidating  threats  to peace and order. In one effort to help the Justice League (in 
Justice League America #36), he encounters what would become his arch-enemy, the (equally incompetent) 
Scarlet Skier, a parody of 

Marvel
's 
Silver Surfer. He later befriends the Scarlet Skier (in Justice League International Vol. 1 #3) and even brings the Scarlet Skier along when 
Maxwell Lord founds the 

Justice League Antarctica
 in an effort to get both G'nort and the unwillingly-heroic 
Injustice League out of his way (in Justice League International Annual #4). There G'Nort actually does save lives. 


He also appears in Green Lantern group scenes, including, after the events of 

Emerald Twilight
, joining many other former Green Lanterns in joining the 





Darkstars




. He also occasionally appears as a solo character, battling his arch-enemy, the 
Scarlet Skier, or being (unsuccessfully) ransomed off by 
Manga Khan to 
Maxwell Lord in exchange for 





L-Ron




. G'nort was last seen as the sole member of 
Super Buddies Antarctica.


G'Nort's look over the years has slowly become more and more canine, and in the recent Guy Gardner: Collateral Damage miniseries, he was written as a bolder character with an air of more confidence, or at least, embittered and less prone to be a joke due to his home planet, G'Newt, being left a scorched mass of rubble by the 
Tormocks, as a neutral casualty of the 











Rann-Thanagar War










.


In the alternate future of Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century, 
Brainiac 5 describes him as a past menace wielding a Power Ring along with the seen-on-panel, but not nominated, 
Sinestro and 
Amon Sur.




Hannu/Honnu


A rock-skinned Green Lantern who fought Hal Jordan on his way to Oa during Emerald Twilight. He recently was found alive on Biot. He does not use his ring in battle (and is rumored to never have), preferring his fists instead. In Green Lantern (Vol 4) #23, he finally activates his ring in battle against the 
Anti-Monitor.




Graf Toren

Graf Toren

A Green Lantern who was rescued by Hal Jordan at some point. Battled the Draal with Guy Gardner and later thought to be killed by Hal Jordan while defending Oa. He recently returned to the Corps when he was rescued by Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner from the Manhunters.




Greet


Despite his outward slovenly appearance, Greet is one of the most respected culinary masters in the universe. He is currently serving as manager of Oa's cafeteria, though when and how he went from ring slinger to hash slinger is a story yet untold. As the majority of his time is spent on Oa, Greet has made numerous requests to bring his family to Oa so he can spend more time with them. It is not known how Greet's partner feels about protecting sector 3443 with Greet stationed on Oa.

As such, he was one of the few post-Crisis DC characters to remember the events of  the Great Crisis  as he referred to it.  Kilowog recruits and trains new members of the Green Lantern Corps.  His most illustrious student is Hal Jordan.  When Jordan was possessed by Parallax, Kilowog was one of the last Green Lanterns to try to stop Jordan from destroying the Central Power Battery.  Kilowog was killed by Jordan, but his spirit was summoned by a group of ex-Green Lanterns bent on avenging the destruction of the Corps at a Parallax-possessed Jordan's hands.  Kilowog was subsequently returned to life by Kyle Rayner.




Kreon





Main article: 
Kreon

Kreon was a Chietain of a militaristic race from the planet Tebis. The Tebans glorified war and the domination of other races. Teban forces had made advances into Space Sector 3319, despite the loss of their hold on the planet Hwagaagaa due to the rebellion led by former Green Lantern Charlie Vicker.


As Chieftan, Kreon led a battle fleet into war against the Quahooga. Unlike others of his race, Kreon fought not to win wars, but to end them. To this end, Kreon bought Star Sapphire from the mercenary Flicker, in the hope to spare hundreds of his warriors from entering battle. Star Sapphire bided her time until she managed to get a weapon, slaughtering a dozen Tebans before she was stopped. Although the Tribunal of Command suggested he kill her, Kreon listened to Flicker, who promised a way to control her. He would bring an old lover of hers, the Green Lantern of Earth, Hal Jordan. 


The plan was a complete failure, neither the Green Lanterns nor Star Sapphire could be contained. Realizing his mistake in trusting Flicker, Kreon assisted the Green Lanterns in the mercenary's downfall. 


The deeds of Kreon may not have been approved of by his fellow Chieftains, but they did attract the attention of Hal Jordan. The Green Lantern offered Kreon membership in the Corps. He is killed by the 
Manhunters.




Laira

Leezle Pon


First mentioned in Alan Moore's 
Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Story, Mogo Doesn't Socialize, Leezle Pon is a sentient smallpox virus who bears a miniaturised Green Lantern Ring; however, due to his nature, he is often unable to attend meetings. It was Leezle Pon who defeated the 





Sinestro Corps




 virus 
Despotellis at the crux of the 











Sinestro Corps War










.




Medphyll





Main article: 
Medphyll

Medphyll is the Green Lantern from J596, where plants are the dominant life form.  He served as a member of the Darkstars, and afterwards encountered 










Jack Knight









 and joined Prince Gavyn's rebellion to reclaim his throne.  He betrayed the rebels, and was killed by Jack Knight in Starman #60. This death was apparently not permanent, since he has been reinstated as a Green Lantern after the rebirth of the corps. His survival is most likely due to his ability to transfer his mind into any kind of plant life. 




Mogo





Main article: 
Mogo

Mogo is not only a Green Lantern, but is also an entire planet. Most notably featured in the 






Alan Moore





 story  Mogo Doesn't Socialize  from Green Lantern v2, #188. Mogo itself is powered by Green Lantern energy and has control over its own surface and natural defenses. Mogo is also the site of the DC/

Dark Horse Comics
 crossover limited series 
Green Lantern Versus Aliens - the Green Lantern Corps (during Jordan's first era as GL) encounter the predatory creatures, and decide that Mogo was the best chance for containment. Mogo assisted in the defeat of 
Superboy-Prime, entering orbit around the red sun 



Rao


 in order to act as a battleground for the depowered Supermen. Currently, Mogo acts as a training, psycho-therapy, and recreation facility for the Green Lantern Corps.




Morro


Morro, a Green Lantern from the planet Sarc, and his four pets, called Dratures, volunteer as cryptkeepers on the Corps' Memorial. Guy Gardner revealed to Kyle Rayner that Morro requested his duty as penance, as he killed his pets' mother in rage when he wrongfully thought it ate his brother. His first act of amending his mistake was to adopt the creature's offspring as his own, then later, as a Green Lantern after the war, to be the Corps' cryptkeeper. Morro is capable of combat and hunting without his ring, and his primary choice of weapon is his mallet. His Dratures are fearsome dragon-like creatures loyal to their master and ready to aid him.




Mother Mercy


Mother Mercy is the creator of the 
Black Mercy plants used by 


Mongul

, and the new Lantern for sector 2261. She initially created them to find people who are suffering and dying to ease their pain, which created a symbiotic relationship with her. However, the first Mongol discovered the plants, and used them to spread his evil, even mutating some of the Black Mercys into giving their victims suffering.  Mother Mercy, however, kept her sentience hidden from Mongol. Her abilities to both ease and create fear gave her both a Green Lantern Corps Ring and a Sinestro Corps ring to choose from. The GL ring, which she ultimately chose, came from the recently deceased Bzzd.




Olapet


Olapet was a plant-based Green Lantern, hailing from the planet of Southern Goldstar.  She, along with Driq and Flodo Span, were the sole survivors of the 
Green Lantern Corps of Klyminade.  The rest were killed by Sinestro and Sentient Sector 3600.




Procanon Kaa


A veteran Green Lantern, Procanon Kaa has served the Corps for generations. He protects Space Sector 422, which includes much of the Khund Empire. By necessity, Procanon Kaa considers himself a warrior but would also mediate fights within the Empire. As could be expected, several Khundish warlords declare the Green Lantern is an enemy of the Empire and have banned him from many of the planets in his sector.




Rot Lop Fan



Rot Lop Fan is one of several unorthodox members of the Green Lantern Corps created by 






Alan Moore





 in Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual #3 (1987). After his introduction, he later occasionally appears in Green Lantern Corps group scenes.


In the Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual #3 story  In the Blackest Night , 
Katma Tui is sent by the 








Guardians of the Universe







 to a lightless region of space known as the Obsidian Deeps, in order to recruit a new Green Lantern to protect that region of space. Despite the absolute darkness of the Deeps, Katma's power ring led her unerringly to a completely fearless and honest resident of the Deeps: Rot Lop Fan. However, as Rot Lop Fan's species had evolved in darkness, they had no concept of light and color, and thus 
Katma Tui was unable to explain how the power ring worked (it projects solid rays of light manifested by the bearer's will power).


Realizing that his species operates by hearing, Katma reshapes the power ring from a lantern into a bell, and describes the Green Lantern Corps as the F-Sharp Bell Corps and the ring's powers in terms of sound instead of light. She also composes a new oath for him to recite.




In loudest din or hush profound

:my ears hear evil's slightest sound


let those who toll out evil's knell

:beware my power, the F-Sharp Bell!


Having solved this dilemma, Katma leaves Rot Lop Fan to protect his people.


Rot Lop Fan later appears in several group scenes, including in the 

Crisis on Infinite Earths
 storyline (Green Lantern Corps #219) when the Guardians of the Universe depart this plane of existence with the 
Zamarons, at the trial of 
Sinestro (Green Lantern Corps #223-#224) and in a group of ex-Green Lanterns freed from slavers by 






Warrior





 (Guy Gardner: Warrior #35).


Rot Lop Fan has apparently been reinstated as a Green Lantern after the rebirth of the Corps.




Saarek


A Green Lantern who claims to be able to speak to the dead. He states that the dead have become cold, and are growing colder by the day, and that the fallen Lanterns are becoming worried by what is to come. He helps his fellow Lanterns track and capture the Sinestro Corps member who have been killing rookie Lantern's families, and is later tasked by one of the Guardians to find and speak with the 
Anti-Monitor's corpse. First appeared in Green Lantern Corps #27.




Salaak





Main article: 
Salaak

Salaak is the Green Lantern of Sector 1418 and a native of the planet Slyggia. A Green Lantern since before Hal Jordan's assumption of the role, his familiarity with protocol and experience in the field led the 








Guardians of the Universe







 to select him to be both the Keeper of the Book of 
Oa and the Guardians' administrative liaison to the rest of the Corps.




Sinestro





Main article: 
Sinestro

Sinestro is a long-time foe of Hal Jordan and the rest of the Green Lantern Corps. He was once the Green Lantern from the planet Korugar (in Sector 1417); however, he believed that the best way to maintain order on Korugar was by using his ring to become the planet's 
dictator. The Guardians of the Universe convict him of criminal actions and banish him to the antimatter universe of 
Qward, where he is given a yellow power ring, and returns to our universe to become Hal Jordan's greatest enemy. He is apparently killed in action, helping defend the Central Power Battery on Oa from the seemingly insane Jordan. However, he is recently seen during Green Lantern: Rebirth, where he revealed that he had somehow faked his death as part of a ploy to make Hal Jordan vulnerable to possession by Parallax. In a battle against Jordan, he flees to the Anti-Matter Universe where he starts the Sinestro Corps.

Guardians of the Universe







. As a 
Daxamite (a race with inherent 

Superman
-like powers) with a power ring, he would be nearly unstoppable. Despite this, in Qull's prophecy, he is still defeated as part of the final destruction of the Green Lantern Corps. 


He is also mentioned in the proposal Alan Moore wrote for his series  









Twilight of the Superheroes








 , which was never published. In the proposal that was leaked onto the internet, the Daxamite Green Lantern is named  Sodol Yat  and is also referred to as  The Ultimate Green Lantern . In that story, Sodol Yat is the last Green Lantern to confront Superman, who has just killed many Green Lanterns, 





Thanagar




ians and the Martian Manhunter. Sodol Yat then kills Superman.


Sodam Yat made his first appearance in regular DC continuity in Green Lantern Corps #12, and part three of the 





Sinestro Corps




 War (Green Lantern Corps #14), when 
Kilowog gathers a group of Lanterns to strike back against Sinestro's forces attacking in Space Sector 2263. 
Salakk singles out Arisia to keep an eye on the newly graduated Lantern Yat, while she wonders why Sodam is so important. Salakk has been charged by the Guardians of the Universe to keep Qull's prophesy from coming to pass, but keeps this to himself, only saying that one day she may know why he is so special. In Green Lantern Corps #16, Sodam destroys 
Ranx' core ending the battle of 
Mogo.


In Green Lantern Corps #17, Sodam Yat is merged with the Ion Entity, becoming the new 
Ion. Merging the Ion power with his Daxamite physiology makes him one of the most powerful characters in the current continuity.




Tomar-Re





Main article: 
Tomar-Re

Tomar-Re is a Lantern with a bird-like head.  He was the first member of the Corps that Hal Jordan ever met, and they were close friends. He was mortally wounded during a battle in the Anti-Matter Universe of 
Qward at the time of the 

Crisis on Infinite Earths
. Upon his death, his ring went to John Stewart.  When Stewart objected the he was already a Green Lantern, Tomar (through his ring) stated,  you are wearing Hal Jordan's ring.   (Hal had quit the Corps some time before, and John was his replacement.)  Tomar died after seeing Hal wearing his old ring once again.




Tomar-Tu





Main article: 
Tomar-Tu

Tomar-Tu is the son of Tomar-Re, and one of the Lost Lanterns recently discovered by Hal Jordan. Although he bears animosity toward Jordan, he at least respects him due to his father. Tu is quoted as saying that although his father understood Earthmen, he never would. Tomar-Tu accompanies Hal Jordan to find the missing John Stewart and Guy Gardner in Green Lantern #23.




Turytt





Main article: 
Turytt


Turytt is the imposing rookie Green Lantern and successor of Ke'Haan. He presides over sector 786.




Xax


Xax of Xaos is a grasshopper-like alien from a planet ruled by insects. He first appeared in Green Lantern v2, #9 and becomes one of Hal Jordan's good friends in the Corps. He was slain during a battle on the moon of Qward during the 

Crisis on Infinite Earths
. Another grasshopper shaped Lantern named Xax is slain and worn as an earring by 
Lady Styx.




Zale


Zale of Bellatrix was 
Boodikka's replacement on the Bellatrix Bombers, and the next of her kind judged worthy by the Guardians to wield a GL ring. She first appeared in Green Lantern Corps #21. As a rookie Lantern who kept ignoring her call to duty, Zale was brought under investigation by her former sister Boodika, now an Alpha-Lantern. After a lengthy confrontation, it was revealed that it was the Bombers who kept Zale from fulfilling her duties, by deceiving her into thinking she was needed with them. The Guardians punished Zale by making her Boodikka's sector partner and removing her power battery, making her dependent on Boodikka for recharges.

Miscellaneous Green Lanterns



Teen Lanterns



Although not 'official' members of the Green Lantern Corps, four teenagers -- Frankie (M), Kelly (F), Jaclyn (F) and Samosa (M) -- are given simplified Green Lantern rings by John Stewart after their homes are abducted to Oa by the Mad Guardian in Green Lantern (Volume 3, 1992) and  (Volume 1, 1992-1993). 


Able to create simple objects, translate languages, synthesize atmosphere and empower flight, these rings enabled the youngsters to explore Oa in the hopes that their youthful ways of looking at the Mosaic (and the other beings trapped there) would help ease relations between the Earthlings and other races.


Having a moderate degree of success, the four helped where they could until the Moasic was torn apart when dozens of space fleets appeared over Oa, each planet determined to bring their people home. 


Presumably the four are back on Earth readjustng to a 'normal' life. At this time, it is unknown how the destruction of the Central Power Battery (GL V3 #50) and subsequent reconstruction by Ion/Kyle Rayner affected the teenagers' rings. It is possible they still exist and can be recharged if given access to a Lantern. 


Another Teen Lantern, unrelated to the others and out-of-continuity is Jordana Gardner, future descendant of Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner, called in such way due to her early recruitment into the Green Lantern Corps of the alternate future detailed in Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century.




Kai-ro





Main article: 
Kai-ro

A Green Lantern that exists in the DCAU.  Appearing in Batman Beyond and the Justice League Unlimited episode Epilogue.  Kai-ro is a Chinese Buddhist who became a Green Lantern at a very young age.  He would join the Justice League and become a friend of Batman.




Kid Lantern


Issue 3 of the miniseries Flash   Green Lantern: The Brave And The Bold has 
Flash, 


Kid Flash

 and 


Green Lantern

 in pursuit of 











Mirror Master










 and 
Black Hand.  In an attempt to steal Flash's speed, it is Kid Flash who loses his powers.  To help out, Green Lantern creates a temporary 
Power Ring for Wally to use, dubbing him Kid Lantern.  Wally's costume is exactly like his Kid Flash costume but with black pants, green shirt and boots, white gloves, and his lightning insignia is replaced with a Green Lantern insignia.




Daffy Duck/Duck Dodgers





Main articles: 


Daffy Duck

 and 








Duck Dodgers












Duck Dodgers as Green Lantern, from  The Green Loontern  (episode #9 of Duck Dodgers).



In episode #9 ( The Green Loontern ) of the 2003 
Duck Dodgers animated series, Duck Dodgers claims his laundry at the dry-cleaners, but mistakenly takes a 

Green Lantern
 uniform instead of his usual outfit.


After discovering that with the aid of his 









power ring








 he can fly, he has a few mishaps involving flight (including a confrontation with a dog while trying to romance a girl in a 
Romeo and Juliet spoof), before he is summoned to 
Oa: in a memorable scene, he zooms uncontrollably through 
outer space, dragged by the power of his ring.


The entire 

Green Lantern Corps
 is kidnapped by 
Sinestro; as a last resort, Duck Dodgers is dispatched by the 








Guardians







 to save the Corps. Through various flukes, he manages to do so, before Hal Jordan returns (dressed in Dodgers' normal spacesuit) to demand the return of his ring and uniform.


While asked by Kilowog to recite the Green Lantern power oath at the Corps Central Battery, a flustered Dodgers gabbles a random rhyme in desperation:


In blackest day or brightest night

:Watermelon, cantaloupe, yadda-e-yadda


Erm...
superstitious and cowardly lot

:With liberty and justice for all!


This episode made use of discarded character concepts for a proposed 

Green Lantern Corps
 animated series. The series would have focused on the adventures of 
Kyle Rayner with a slightly comical version of the Corps. The episode included the first animated versions of 






Guy Gardner





, 
Ch'p, and 
Boodikka.




Green Guardsman



A Green Guardsman was featured on the 
Justice League animated series' season one two-part episode Legends as an homage to the original Alan Scott. He appeared as a 

Justice Guild of America
 member on an alternate Earth that was devastated by nuclear war, but reconstructed as a vast mental illusion by a psychic, Ray Thompson. This was a reference to the pre-

Crisis on Infinite Earths
 
crossovers between 

DC Comics
' 






Multiverse





 (which began in Sep. 1961  Flash of Two Worlds ). To mirror the 
Golden Age Green Lantern ring's vulnerability to wood, the Green Guardsman's ring had no power over 
aluminum. He represented the Golden Age mentality of comics, accidentally making a 
racist gaffe when he told the 
African-American Green Lantern John Stewart  you're a credit to your people, son ; however, the Green Guardsman proved to be a loyal superhero of a bygone era, and willingly sacrificed himself to defend the Earth he protected.





Green Lanterns by Sectors of the Universe


After long experimentation the Guardians equipped and loosely oversaw the Green Lantern Corps, 7200+ diverse beings from throughout the universe.  Each was granted a battery and a ring. Thinly scattered among uncounted trillions of stars, each was assigned a sector of space which was vaster than anyone can comprehend.


The sectors are shaped as four-sided pyramid-shaped sections of a sphere, with their point meeting at Oa, which is located at the center of the universe.  Oa is technically in each Lantern's sector, and while on Oa, the Lantern is still in his home sector


There are 3600 standard space sectors, plus three  special  sectors: 0 (Oa itself) -1 (Anti-Matter universe) and 3601 (proscribed sector of space populated by the 
Manhunters)

1899 births
Members of the South Australian House of Assembly
1976 deaths
Independent Australian politicians







Tom Stott (far right) at a  Press v Parliament  cricket match, 1947




Tom Cleave Stott 






CBE





 (
6 June 
1899-
21 October 
1976) spent 37 years as an independent member of the 

South Australian House of Assembly
, serving as Speaker of the House from 1962 to 1965 and 1968 to 1970.


Born in 

Norwood, South Australia
, Stott completed primary school and began working for his father on their 2225 hectare wheat farm near Mindarie, in the 
Murray Mallee region of 
South Australia, while continuing his education through Workers' Educational Association (WEA) classes and extensive reading.


Stott showed great interest in the problems facing his fellow wheat farmers and joined the newly formed 

Country Party
 in 1920.  As President of his local branch, Stott began to raise his profile around the electorate and in farming circles, helping to found the Farmers Protection Association in 1929, the South Australian Wheatgrowers Protection Association (SAWPA) in 1930 and the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation (AWF) in 1931.  He was also appointed General Secretary of each of these organisations.


Stott was considering seeking Country Party preselection for his local 
Electoral district of Albert at the 1933 election when it was announced that the Country Party would merge with the urban based 
Liberal Federation to form the 
Liberal and Country League (LCL).  He opposed the move, fearing both that the rural prerogative of the Country Party would be diminished and that his preselection may become more difficult.  His fears were partly realised when he lost LCL pre-selection; Stott promptly resigned from the party to run as an independent.


Stott was given little chance of winning but his standing within the influential wheat farming community in Albert, his 
Freemasonry connections and his vocal opposition to the Country Party/Liberal Federation merger led to his election.  He soon proved to be a thorn in the side of the newly elected LCL government of 

Richard Layton Butler
, being dubbed the  Farmer's Champion  due to his vocal support of 





Great Depression




 affected farmers, and, due to the ineffectiveness of the 

Labor Party
, Stott was considered by the LCL to be  a greater nuisance than the whole of the Opposition put together .


Upon his election in 1933, Stott was forced to resign from his Secretariat position with SAWPA but retained his role with the AWF.  He also helped found the Primary Producers Council of Australia (the antecedent of the 
National Farmers' Federation) in 1934 and continued to play a leading role within that organisation.  This influence within these important primary industry bodies allowed Stott to build a power base for himself that assisted with his continued re-election over the next three decades.


In addition to his parliamentary work on rural issues, such as successfully introducing legislation to secure a (high) stable price for wheat and to enable bulk handling of grain, Stott also proved himself to be adept at championing prickly social issues, including introducing a successful Private Member's Bill to reduce the period a divorce could be granted in the case of desertion from five to three years.  This success led the government to approach Stott to introduce other controversial social issue legislation that the LCL supported but did not want to introduce.  The public recognised this and many people who approached Stott for assistance were not in his electorate.


While Stott was comfortably re-elected at the 1938 election in the newly formed 



Electoral district of Ridley


 (following the division of Albert into two single electoral districts), the result of the election, whereby 15 independents were elected, alongside 15 LCL and nine ALP, led to uncertainty over which party, if any could form government.  This confusion led Stott, as the most experienced and well known of the Independent MPs, to believe that he could become Premier.  He failed to gain the support of sufficient independents and LCL members to achieve this but, as the de facto leader of the Independent caucus within parliament, the LCL government were forced to rely on his support far more than they would have liked.


The commencement of 







World War II






 led Stott to argue that the forthcoming 1941 election should be cancelled and an LCL/ALP/Independent coalition government instigated (perhaps with himself in a prominent position) to concentrate on fighting the war.  The election went ahead with Stott easily retaining his seat due to his reputation for his unstinting support of farmers, to the point that he was known as  Christ of the Mallee  where, it was written,   few would have glanced if he had walked on water .


Following the 1941 election, Premier 

Tom Playford
 approached Stott about joining the LCL but while Stott refused, he remained a fervent admirer of Playford and publicly praised the Premier wherever possible.  In return, Playford pressured the LCL into not standing a candidate against Stott for successive elections and when the local LCL branch finally refused Playford's request, he apologised profusely to Stott and did little to support the candidate of his own party.   


Stott's continued electoral success can not purely be credited to his influence within bodies like the AWF.  Stott was also heavily involved with the wine and citrus industries and helped get producers in both industries significant government concessions.  He was renowned for his indepth knowledge of any issue he debated, which he achieved through prodigious research.  His wife Linda, whom he married in 1926, was also a savvy political campaigner who was heavily involved in issues around the electorate and proved a great asset for Stott.  Perhaps however, his greatest asset was his reputation as a tireless campaigner who never gave up on a constituent issue; in one case Stott spent over twenty years arguing with government departments on behalf of constituent seeking to be connected to the water supply before his eventual success.  Taking into account his public persona as a man with a square jaw, resonant voice and great presence who drank, smoked and owned and wagered on horses (Stott would serve as President of the South Australian Racehorse Owners Association), and who was not afraid of condemnation by the churches for this lifestyle, Stott retained statewide popularity throughout his term in parliament.   


Following the 1962 election, there was a hung parliament whereby the LCL held 19 seats, Labor 19 and Stott held the balance of power.  The ALP were initially hopeful of convincing Stott to support them in government but Playford praised Stott for his long service to South Australia, Stott referred to Playford as the greatest Premier in history and the Labor Party resigned itself to another three years in opposition.  Playford named Stott Speaker of the House, ensuring that Stott had the casting vote on any contentious legislation, which he used almost without fail to support the LCL. 


Stott lost the speakership following the 






1965 election





 but regained it (and the balance of power) in 1968 when the LCL, under 

Steele Hall
 returned to power.  The government, being reliant on Stott's support, always welcomed his suggestions and when Stott recommended the construction of a dam at Chowilla (within his electorate), the LCL initially readily agreed.  However, Hall realised the proposed dam would be an expensive white elephant and refused to fund the dam.   Protests in Ridley forced Stott to vote with the Opposition to defeat Hall's government, leading to the return of 


Don Dunstan

 as 
Premier, something that Stott had fervently worked against for the previous decade.  


Following his retirement at the 1970 election Stott lent his expertise to the Country Party as an organiser and campaign director and died in 1976, still angry with Steele Hall over Chowilla Dam.

Hideaway is a 
novel written by 



Dean Koontz


 and published by 

Random House
 in 
1992.  It is a 
supernatural 











thriller










 centering on an 
antique 
dealer named Hatch Harrison who develops a 
telepathic connection with a 
serial killer after a 
car accident leaves him clinically 
dead for over eighty minutes. It was made into a 

film of the same name
 starring 

Jeff Goldblum
 and 


Alicia Silverstone

 in 1995. 



Plot summary



Following a traffic accident that left him clinically dead for more than 80 minutes, a Southern California antique dealer named Hatch Harrison begins experiencing strange dreams and visions that connect him to a psychopathic killer, a young man who calls himself  





Vassago




 . Vassago believes that he is the human incarnation of one of the demon princes of 
Hell, and that if he murders enough innocent human beings and offers them up in sacrifice to his Master, he will be allowed to return to the afterlife and rule at 






Satan





's right hand. He also has a strange condition that enables him to see in the dark, but also causes his eyes to be extremely sensitive to 
light.


Meanwhile, the accident gives Hatch and his wife Lindsey, an artist, a new lease on life as they struggle to rebuild their marriage in the wake of their son's death from cancer five years before. As the couple set about trying to adopt a young girl named Regina, Hatch continues to be tormented by visions, in some cases even seeing through the monstrous killer's eyes. Making matters worse, Vassago slowly gains information about Hatch and his family in the same fashion, putting both Lindsay and Regina in danger.


We eventually learn that Vassago's real name is Jeremy Nyebern; as a teenager, he brutally murdered his mother and sister, then attempted to kill himself. His life was saved by the same doctor who miraculously resuscitated Hatch... namely, Dr. Jonas Nyebern, Jeremy's father (thus facilitating the seemingly supernatural bond between the two characters). Like Hatch, Jeremy was clinically dead for more than 30 minutes, and during that time, believes that he went to hell and was later returned to do Satan's bidding. At the book's climax, Vassago's visions lead him to kidnap Regina and take her to his  hideaway  (an abandoned amusement park, where, as a boy, Jeremy committed his first murder). There, he is confronted by Hatch, who bludgeons Vassago to death with a crucifix attached to a flashlight, thus saving Regina and Lindsay. During the closing moments of this confrontation, Hatch inexplicably begins speaking in another voice and calls himself  



Uriel


  (whom Hatch later learns is an 
archangel mentioned in the 
Bible), thus implying that Vassago's beliefs about his demonic heritage and short-lived journey to the afterlife may not have been entirely 
delusional after all. Uriel/Hatch tells Vassago/Jeremy that instead of returning to hell as a prince, he will be returned as a slave.

Western kingdoms in ancient Bharat
Ancient Indian kingdoms




Sivi (alias Sibi, Shibi, Shivi) is mentioned as a kingdom and as the name of a king in the epic 
Mahabharata. Probably there was a Sivi king who became famous as Sivi or the kingdom itself may be named after him. Sivi (alias Sibi, Saivya) king was famous for his truthfulness. The legend about his truthfulness and compassion goes as follows:- King Sivi protected a dove who was chased by a hawlk (which wanted to eat the dove as its mid-day meal) and gave flesh from his thigh, as a substitute meal to the halwk.

It is also mentioned in the epic that 


Jayadratha

 was the king of 





Sindhu




, 





Sauvira




 and Sivi kingdoms. Probably 
Sauvira and Sivi were two kingdom close to the Sindhu kingdom and Jayadratha conquered them, which would place Sivi somewhere in western 

Rajasthan
 though alternatively it should also be 








Sibi







, 






Balochistan





 which is to the west of 
Sauvira and 
Sindhu and adjacent to both. Jayadratha was an ally of 


Duryodhana

 and husband of Duryodhana's sister 
Dussala.



Geographical locations


According to Sivi Jataka, king Sivi (as Bodhisatta) had ruled in Aritthapura (Aristapura of 

Sanskrit
) and is said to have donated his eyes to a blind Brahmana 1. Chinese traveler, 
Fa-hien, records the scene of this story at So-ho-to (Swat), a country to the south of 










Oddiyana









 between 
Kabol and 
Indus 2. In some versions, Sivi appears as a personal name but in others it is the name of the country and its people. According to Hiuen Tsang (629 AD - 645 AD), Sivika (Sibika) had cut his body to pieces to save a dove from a hawk 3. According to 
Hiuen Tsang, Sivika is a personal name or an epithet (which implies that he was a ruler of Sivi country). 
Chinese envoy Song Yun (518-20 AD) also refers to Sivika raja (Sivi king) and connects him to Oddiyana 4. Thus, the  Chinese evidence evidently connects king Sivi/Sivika and the Sivi people/or Country with the Oddiyana/Swat territory between river 
Kabol and 
Indus which forms part of modern North west frontier province of 

Pakistan
. Aritthapura of the Buddhist Vessantara Jataka is same as the Orobatis of Alexander's historians 5. Dr B. C. Law connects Jataka's Aritthapura with 





Ptolemy




's Aristobothro in the north of Punjab 6. It has been identified with Shahbazgarhi region, north of river Kabol 7. Dr S. B. Chaudhury also states that Aritthapura of the Sivi Jataka  points to Swat valley as the ancient country of the Sivis8. 
Matsya Purana says that Indus flowed through the janapada of Sivapura (country of the Sivis) 9. There is also another Buddhist legend known as Vessantara Jataka which states that king Vessantara was grandson of king Sivi and ruled in a kingdom with capital at Jatuttara. King Vessantara as a Bodhisatta had given away his magical elephant (which could bring rain on the asking) to a hostile country, and also his kingdom as well as his family with two children to a greedy Brahmana, all as acts of benevolence and generosity 10. Envoy Sung Yun makes reference to king Vessantara of Vessantara Jataka (as Pi-lo) 11  while pilgrim 
Hiuen Tsang refers to him (as Sudana) 12 and interestingly both place the scene of history in the Oddiyana/Swat, north of Kabol river 13. But the Jatuttara of Vessantara Jataka is taken to be same as Jattaraur of 
Al-Biruni 14 and is often identified with Nagri or Tambavati Nagri, 11 miles north of Chittore in 
Rajputana 15. In this connection, Dr N. L. Dey has rightly observed that there were two countries called Sivi---one located in Swat with its capital at Aritthapura and the second is the same as the Sivika of Varahamihira 16 which he places among the countries of the south-west with its capital at Jatuttara in Madhyamika (south-west Rajputana) 17. It has also been suggested that Sivi was originally a geographical name from which the name of its ruler and that of its people may have been derived 18. In Brahmanical literature like Mahabharata, name Sivi is connected with Asura and like 
Kamboja, this name (Sivi) is also linked to mythological goddess 




Diti



 19. The Brahmanical texts also mention that king Sivi was son of king Usinara and was from Anava (Anu) lineage. While referring to a certain Sakya legend connected with Oddiyana locale (north-west frontiers province of Pakistan), James Fergusson connects the Oddiyana country with the 
Kamboja of the 
Hindu texts 20. Indeed, the territories of 
Kunar, 










Oddiyana









, 
Swat and 
Varana (Aorna of classical writers) etc had been the notable habitats of the 
Asvaka Kambojas since remote antiquity. The Asvakas were famous cattle breeders and horse folk and had earned the epithet of Asvakas due to their intimate connections with the Asva (or horses). The Sivis, as described by Alexander's historians, were a shaved-headed people, worshipers of god Siva, wore clothes made from animal skins, and were warlike people who fought with the clubs...most of these are also the salient characteristics of the ancient Kambojas. Mahabharata refers to the Kambojas as Munda (i.e shaved-headed soldiery) 21. In the same Mahabharata text, Rudra Siva is also given the epithet of Munda 22.  The Kambojas are also attested to have been ardent worshipers of Siva-cult (Munda-cult). In fact, the Mahabharata evidence shows that the promulgator of synthetic Siva cult was one 


sage Upamanyu

, son of Vyaghrapada. Upamanyu was a disciple of Ayodha Dhaumya who taught at 

Taxila
 University  in Gandhara 23. The northern Kamboja affinities of this  Upamanyu (the epic promulgator of Synthetic Siva cult) are indicated and have been accepted 24 since his son/or descendant 


Aupamanyava

 is specifically referred to as Kamboja in the 
Vamsa Brahmana 25 of the 
Samaveda 26.  Since Munda is an epithet of god 
Rudra-Siva, it has also been suggested that the Sivis derive their name from god Siva whom they ardently worshiped. According to IHQ:  So strong was the hold of the Siva cult with this people that they got their name from the deity they worshiped  27.


It appears likely that the Sivis originally lived in north of river Kabol in remote antiquity, from where sections of them moved southwards in later times and settled in what is called Seva around Bolan Pass, which region was known as Sivistan till recently. 
Panini also mentions a place called Sivapura which he includes in the Udichya (northern) division of Ancient India 28 and which is identified by some scholars with Sibipura of the Shorkot Inscriptions edited by Vogel. The southerly movement of the Sivis is also evidenced from their other settlement called Usinara near Yamuna, ruled by Sivi king called Usinara 29. Sivis also are attested to have one settlement in Sind, another one in Madhyamika (Tambavati Nagri) near Chittore (in Rajputana) and yet another one on the Dasa Kumara-chrita on the banks of the Kaveri in southern India (Karnataka/Tamilnadu) 30. It is mentioned in the epic that 


Jayadratha

 was the king of 





Sindhu




, 





Sauvira




 and Sivi kingdoms. 
Sauvira and Sivi were two kingdom close to the Sindhu kingdom and Jayadratha conquered them, which would place Sivi somewhere in 






Balochistan





 which is to the west of 
Sauvira and 
Sindhu and adjacent to both. Some writers think that Sivi may have been originally located at the foot of Bolan Pass from there they might have extended their influence to Oddiyana/Swat but this is unlikely. 


Taking clue from 






Yaska





's 
Nirukta 31, Dr S Levi states that  the Kambhojas were a branch of the Bhojas and were not a part of the Aryans (i.e Indo Aryans)  32. Name Kambhojas (=Kambojas) is etymologised as   Kamblala + Bhojas  (the Bhojas with Kambalas or blankets) as well as  Kamniya + Bhojas  (the handsome Bhojas or the desirable Bhojas). Thus, Dr S Levi, Dr Moti Chandra, Dr K. P. Jayaswal, J. F. Hewitt, J. G. R. Forlong etc etc have connected the ancient Bhojas with the Kambhojas (or Kambojas). Both Kambojas and the Bhojas are also referred to as north-western people in the 13th 
Rock Edict of king 
Asoka. Thus, the Kambojas (a horse people) appear to have either been anciently and inadvertently confused with the Bhojas who were a 
Yadava 
tribe (a cattle breeding tribe) or else there was indeed some kind of link between the Bhojas and the ancient Kambhojas as Dr S Levi suggests 33 34 and Dr Moti Chandra, Dr K. P. Jayaswal etc etc accept. Very interestingly, writers like James F. K. Hewitt, J. G. R. Forlong etc also connect the Sivis, Bhojas and the Drhuyus with the Kambhojas 35. The Chinese evidence on king Sivi as well as king Vessantara (Sudana, Saniraja or Pi-lo of the Chinese records), the rulers of Oddiyana (in pre-Buddhist times) also seems to lend a fair credence in this direction.

 Cultural traits 


At (3:196) the people of the Sivi tribe is mentioned to have meat of bull cooked with rice as part of their diet. This practice is similar to the non-vegetarianism of the 
Bahlika Culture, where people ate cakes of barley mixed with beef.


The words of 


Karna

 upon various tribes and their characteristics (Karna's opinion is however, biased):- The 





Magadhas




 are comprehenders of signs; the 





Koshalas




 comprehend from what they see; the 





Kurus




 and the 





Panchalas




 comprehend from a half-uttered speech; the 





Salwas




 cannot comprehend till the whole speech is uttered. The 





Parvatas




 like the 





Sivis




, are very stupid. The 





Yavanas




 are omniscient; the Suras are particularly so. The 
Mlecchas are wedded to the creations of their own fancy that the peoples cannot understand (8:45).




 Military habits


It is mentioned at (12:165) that the Sivis acquired the science of using swords in battle from the 
Yadavas. At (12:100) there is a mention that the southerners are skilled in fighting sword. It is not clear if any link existed between the southern kingdoms (





Cholas




, 





Pandyas




 and 





Keralas




) with the Sivis. However the word Sivi is indicative of the worship of 
Siva. Southerners also were well-known Siva-worshipers. 


King Pratardana is mentioned as acquiring the knowledge of sword-fight from Sivis(12:100). Pratardana was the son of Madhavi and 





Kasi




 king named Divodasa, thus the step brother of king Sivi (5:117). Kasi was, and even now is the seat of Siva-worship.




 Kings of Sivi 



 King Sivi 



King Sivi seems to be the founder of the Sivi royal family. His father Usinara could be a Bhoja-Yadava.


King Sivi is mentioned as the son of Usinara (3:196,197, 1:188). The name of King Sivi's mother was Madhavi, described to be the daughter of king Yayati (Yayati is likened to Sivi in many passages such as 1:93, 5:121,122) of 



Lunar Dynasty


. At (5:118) king Usinara is mentioned as a Bhoja (a sub-sect of 
Yadavas). He is mentioned as saying:- My wealth exists for only my subjects residing in the city and the country, and not for my own comforts and enjoyment. That king who giveth away for his own pleasure the wealth that belongeth to others, can never earn virtue or fame. 


At (3:196) Sivi is described as the king of the Sivi tribe. The legend connecting the Sivi king with the hawk chasing the dove also is detailed here. Sivi is mentioned to have a son named Kapota-Roman, who is mentioned to be a great king of the Sauratha clan. Another son of Sivi is also mentioned thus:- Sivi s son of great energy, viz., Gopati by name, has been brought up in the forest among kine (due to fear of 
Bhargava Rama, who massacred 
Haiheyas) (12:49). 


The legend of Sivi is repeated at many passages (13:32, 14:90). King Sivi, the son of Usinara, of great forbearance attained to heaven, which is hard to reach, giving away his own flesh (3:207). King Sivi granted life to the pigeon (13:67). Usinara s son Sivi, gave his own limbs and the dear son of loins for the sake of a Brahmana (12:233). King Sivi, the son of Usinara, offered the life of his dear son, for the benefit of a Brahmana (13:137). At a sacrifice which had been performed in former times by Sivi s son he had given away unto the Ritwiks a son of his as the sacrificial present (13:93). The royal son of Sivi also won the highest regions of felicity by having gratified 



Surya


 along with his companion (12:292).


A certain king of the name of Suhotra belonging to the 





Kuru




 race went on a visit to the great Rishis. And as he was returning from that visit, he beheld king Sivi the son of Usinara, seated on his car, and as each came before the other, each saluted the other as best befitted his age and each regarding himself as the equal of the other (3:193).


Sivi is considered as one among the famous kings of ancient era (2:8, 4:56, 6:9, 13:115). King Sivi himself had said this, viz.,  Fie on that king in whose kingdom a Brahmana or even any other man languishes from hunger.  (5:90, 13:61). King Sivi caused the whole earth to resound with the rattle of his wheels and subjugated all monarchs (12:29). Vishwabhuk, Bhutadhaman, Sivi of great energy, Santi the fourth, and Tejaswin, these it is said were the five Indras of old (1:199)


(7:56):- That king had, as it were, put a leathern girdle around the earth, making the earth with her mountains and islands and seas and forests resound with the clatter of his car. The vanquisher of foes, viz., king Sivi. always slew the foremost of foes. He performed many sacrifices with presents in profusion unto the 

Brahmana
s. That monarch of great prowess and great intelligence had acquired enormous wealth. In battle: he won the applause of all 


Kshatriya

s. Having brought the whole earth under subjection, he performed many Horse-sacrifices (
Ashwamedha, without any obstruction, giving away (as sacrificial present) a thousand crores of golden nishkas, and many elephants and steeds and other kinds of animals, much grain, and many deer and sheep. And king Sivi gave away the sacred earth consisting of diverse kinds of soil unto the Brahmanas. Indeed, Usinara s son, Sivi, gave away great number of kine. Many were the sacrifices, with every kind of rites, that king Sivi performed. In those sacrifices, the stakes, the carpets, the houses, the walls, and the arches, were all made of gold. Food and drink, agreeable to the taste and perfectly clean were kept in profusion.  Milk and curds were collected in large tanks. 


An 



Asura


 named Sivi is mentioned as the son of Diti at (1:67). (Diti was a matriarch, whose descendants form the race of Daityas, a group of 
Asuras.) Diti had one son called Hiranyakasipu. And the illustrious Hiranyakasipu had five sons, all famous throughout the world. The eldest of them all was Prahlada, the next was Sahradha; the third was Anuhrada; and after him were Sivi and Vashkala (1:65).




 Jayadratha 



Jayadratha was not only the king of Sivi kingdom, but also the king of 





Sauvira




, 





Sindhu




 and other countries too (3:265). The warriors of the 





Sivi




, 





Sauvira




 and 





Sindhu




 tribes were under the command of Jayadratha (3:269). Jayadratha is mentioned as the sole ruler, governing with justice the rich countries of Saivya, 





Sivi




, 





Sindhu




 and others at (3:265). 


Jayadratha

 had under his sway ten kingdoms, having Sindhu as the manin kingdom (8:5).


Jayadratha is mentioned to have a son named Suratha at (14:78). Suratha's son battled with 


Arjuna

 during his military campaign after the great 

Kurukshetra War
. Words of Dussala (sister of 


Duryodhana

 and wife of 


Jayadratha

 spoken to 


Arjuna

:- Even as 


Parikshit

, has been born of your son 


Abhimanyu

, so has this child, my grandson, sprung from Suratha.




 Kotika 


Kotika (also known as Kotikakhya) is mentioned as the ornament of Sivi s race at (3:264) and as the scion of the race of Sivi at (3:265). Here he is mentioned as under the command of 





Sindhu




 king 


Jayadratha

. He engages in a conversation with 


Pandava

s's wife 


Draupadi

, on behalf of king 


Jayadratha

. Jayadratha tried to abduct Draupadi. But the 
Pandavas came and recued her by defeating the army of Jayadratha:- 
Pandavas killed in battle, with the arrow, the leaders of the 
Ikshwakus and the hosts of 





Sivis




 and 





Trigartas




 and 





Saindhavas




 (3:269).


Kotika is mentioned as king Suratha's son at (3:263,264). Suratha is mentioned as the king of 





Trigartas




 at (3:269) Kotika was slain by 


Bhima

 and Suratha was slain by 


Nakula

 during the fight with Jayadratha. (In Mahabharata there are many people with the name Suratha. One was the son of 


Drupada

 a 

Kurukshetra War
 hero, another is mentioned as one among the great kings of the acneint era.) Another epithet of Kotika, mentioned here is Saivya. It is unclear if the term Saivya meant belonging to the Sivi clan or if Saivyas were a different tribe altogather, other than the Sivis.


Suratha, could as well be used as a family-name in most of the above cases.




 Other Sivi (Saivya) kings 






A Saivya king is mentioned as much afflicted by the loss of his children (1:1)


A Saivya king was slain by 
Vasudeva Krishna (3:12).


A Saivya king who was Vrishadarbha s son was mentioned at (13:93).







Nakula's expedition to Sivi Kingdom 






Nakula

, surrounded by a large host, set out from 





Khandavaprastha




 (older name of 








Indraprastha







, the capital of the kingdom of 
Pandavas) for the west, making this earth tremble with the shouts and the leonine roars of the warriors and the deep rattle of chariot wheels. And the hero first assailed the mountainous country called Rohitaka that was dear unto Kartikeya and which was delightful and prosperous and full of kine and every kind of wealth and produce. And the encounter the son of 


Pandu

 had with the Mattamyurakas of that country was fierce. And the illustrious Nakula after this, subjugated the whole of the desert country and the region known as Sairishaka full of plenty, as also that other one called Mahetta. And the hero had a fierce encounter with the royal sage Akrosa. And the son of Pandu left that part of the country having subjugated the 





Dasarnas




, the 





Sivis




, the 





Trigartas




, the Amvashtas, the 





Malavas




, the five tribes of the 





Karnatas




, and those 

Brahmana
 classes that were called the Madhyamakeyas and Vattadhanas (2:31).





Nakula

 was sent to conquer the

Trigartas




. He brought the western region under the power of 


Yudhisthira

 (5:23).

Yudhishthira by hundreds and thousands. (2:51).




Sivis in Kurukshetra War



In 

Kurukshetra War
, the Sivis under 


Jayadratha

 sided with the 
Kauravas. Similarly a Saivya clan of Govasanas, (though 


Yudhisthira

 had a wife belonging to this clan) sided with the Kauravas. Another Sivi king seems to side with the 
Pandavas, who probably was the descendant of the original Sivi king.



 On Kaurava's side 



King Saivya of the country of the Govasanas, accompanied by all the monarchs, went out on a princely elephant worthy of royal use and graced with a banner on its back, on the side of the 
Kauravas (6:17). This Saivya is mentioned again at (6:100). Saivya, the chief of the Govasanas, with a thousand foremost warriors, faced the son of the king of the 





Kasis




 and resisted him (7:92,93). 



Sakuni, the ruler of the 





Gandharas




, and all the chiefs of the eastern and the northern regions, and the 





Sakas




, the 





Kiratas




, and 





Yavanas




, the 





Sivis




 and the Vasatis with their Maharathas at the heads of their respective divisions came and joined the 


Kaurava

 army (5:198).


Many combatants belonging to the Nishadas, the 





Sauviras




, the 





Valhikas




, the 





Daradas




, the Westerners, the Northerners, the 





Malavas




, the Abhighatas, the 





Surasenas




, the 





Sivis




, the Vasatis, the 





Salwas




, the 





Sakas




, the 





Trigartas




, the Amvashthas, and the 





Kekayas




, similarly fell upon 


Arjuna

 (6:118). The Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the 





Sivis




, and the Vasatis, the 





Swalyas




, the 








Matsyas







, the Amvashtas, the 





Trigartas




, and the 
Kekayas, the 





Sauviras




, the Kitavas, and the dwellers of the Eastern, Western, and the Northern countries,--these twelve brave races were resolved to fight reckless of the lives protecting 


Bhishma

, the commander-in-chief of the 
Kauravas(6:18). 


The Abhishahas, clad in mail, capable of smiting effectually, and fierce in battle, also the 





Sivis




, those foremost of car-warriors, with the 





Kalingas




, have all been slain (8:5). Sivi's on the side of Kauravas were mentioned at many other passages like at (6:51,107, 7:90,158)




 On Pandava's side 



The king of 





Kasi




, and also 





Saivya




, being very friendly to 
Yudhishthira, arrived there, each accompanied by an 
Akshauhini of troops (4:72). 
Yuyudhana, and 


Virata

, and that mighty car-warrior 


Drupada

, and Dhrishtaketu, and Chekitana, and the ruler of 





Kasi




 and Purujit, and Kuntibhoja, and Saivya that bull among men; and Yudhamanyu of great prowess, and Uttamaujas ..etc were mentioned as leaders of the Pandava army (6:25). This Saivya is mentioned again at (6:50,51). At (7:10) he is mentioned as the grandson of Usinara:- (words of 


Dhritarashtra

) We do not see in the three worlds a second person other than Usinara s son who, was, has ever been, or will ever be born, who hath attained heaven, O, who (amongst my army) resisted that Saivya, that grandson of that Usinara s son, while he came upon 


Drona

? Saivya that foremost of men had learnt the science of arms under 


Arjuna

 (2:4).





Bhima

sena and 


Arjuna

 and 


Satyaki

, and the sons of 


Drupada

, and the ruler of 





Kasi




, the son of Saivya, and Sivi himself, cheerfully and with loud roars covered 


Drona

 with their arrows (7:8). 


Virata

 and 


Drupada

, and the 





Kaikeya




 princes, and 


Satyaki

, and Sivi, and Vyaghradatta, the prince of the 





Panchalas




, and the valiant Singhasena, these, and many others, desirous of rescuing 
Yudhishthira, surrounded 


Drona

 (7:16).


King Sivi, of great prowess, filled with rage, proceeded against that mighty car-warrior, viz., the heroic son of Bharadwaja, viz. 


Drona

, while the latter was thus employed in grinding (the hostile combatants). Beholding that great car-warrior of the 
Pandavas advancing, Drona pierced him with ten shafts made entirely of iron. Sivi, however, pierced Drona in return with thirty shafts, winged with Kanka feathers. And smiling the while, he also, with a broad-headed shaft felled the driver of Drona s car. Drona then, slaying the steeds of the illustrious Sivi as also the driver of his car, cut off from his trunk Sivi s head with head-gear on it. (7:152).





Sivi (Saivya) Princesses 



There was born in the family of the 



Ikshwaku


 tribe, a ruler of the earth named Sagara. He had two wives. One a princess of the 





Vidarbha




 race, and the other of the royal line of Sivi (3:106). A son was born to Sagara, known by the name of Asamanjas, he who was given birth to by the princess of Sivi. And he used to seize by throat the feeble children of the townsmen, and threw them while screaming into the river (3:107).








Salwa




 king Dyumatsena's wife also was a Saivya princess (3:296,297). Satyavan was their son. 





Kuru




 king Pratipa married Sunanda, the daughter of Sivi, and begat upon her three sons, viz., Devapi, 


Santanu

 and 





Valhika




 (1:95). 
Yudhishthira, having obtained for his wife Devika, the daughter of Govasana of the Saivya tribe, in a self-choice ceremony, begat upon her a son named 





Yaudheya




. (Yudhisthira seems to have abducted Devika against the will of his father, as king Saivya of Govasana is mentioned as battling against the 
Pandavas in 

Kurukshetra War
). 
Vasudeva Krishna had a wife called Saivya (princess of Sivi kingdom ) (16:7).




Other References





One of the horses possessed by 
Vasudeva Krishna was named Siavya (1:122)(belonging to the Sivi country), the other being Sugriva.


A river named Saivya is mentioned at (6:9)

Cathedral of the Ascension Convent (1580s), from an early 19th-century drawing.




The Ascension Convent, known as the Starodevichy Convent until 1817 (

Russian
: Voznesensky monastery,                       ), was a female 
cloister in the 








Moscow Kremlin







 which contained the burials of grand princesses, 
tsarinas, and other noble ladies from the Muscovite royal court.


It is believed that the Ascension Monastery was founded in 1389 next to the 
Saviour Gates of the Kremlin by 
Dmitry Donskoy's widow, 
Eudoxia Dmitriyevna, who would take the veil there. The foundation stone for the cathedral was laid in 
1407, just before her death. Eight years later, the cathedral was gutted by fire and then rebuilt in 1467 by princess 
Maria Yaroslavna, wife of 
Vasili II of Russia. 


Sixteen years later the monastery was again damaged by fire and then restored in 1518-1519 to a design by 





Aloisio the New




. This church was completely rebuilt in 1587-1588, when a new five-domed structure, mirroring the nearby 
Archangel Cathedral, was erected. It was a major monument to embody the conservative architectural approach of 

Boris Godunov
's circle  (illustrated, to the right).


Among those buried in the cathedral vault were 
Sophia Vitovtovna (wife of 
Vasili I), 








Sophia Paleologue







 (wife of 












Ivan III











), several wives of 
Ivan the Terrible, Grand Duchess 
Eudoxia Alexeyevna (daughter of 

Alexei Mikhailovich
), and tsarina 







Maria Vladimirovna






 (first wife of 
Mikhail Feodorovich). 


The monastery was also used as a residence for royal fiancees prior to the wedding. It was there that Ivan IV's widow, 


Maria Nagaya

, greeted 
Marina Mnishek, who would spend there a few days before her wedding with Nagaya's purported son, 
False Dmitry I. In 1634, 
Michael I of Russia commissioned a new monastery church to be built and dedicated to his patron saint, 








Michael Maleinos







. A 
belltower next to this church was constructed in the late 17th century. The Church of Michael Maleinos used to be home to a rare 
sculpture of 
St George, made by 





Vasili Yermolin




 and installed there in 1808. 


St Catherine Church of the Ascension Convent.





In 1721, the monastery was renovated on behest of 


Peter the Great

. In 1737, it was damaged by fire and again renovated by the order of 


Anna Ioannovna

. During the 
Patriotic War of 1812, the 
sacristy of the Ascension Monastery, with the Icon of the Virgin 







Hodegetria






, painted by 









Dionisius








 in 1482, was moved to 
Vologda. A two-storey 
almshouse was added in 1823. But the most important 19th-century addition was the Church of Saint Catherine, built to a fanciful 
Neo-Gothic design by 








Carlo Rossi







 (illustrated, to the right).


By 1907, the monastery had a 
mother superior, 62 
nuns and 45 
lay sisters. Ten years later, the ancient buildings were damaged by artillery fire during the 





October Revolution




. In 1929, the monastery complex - including the majestic 16th-century cathedral - was dismantled by the 



Soviets


 in order to make room for the 
Red Commanders School, named after the 
All-Russian Central Executive Committee.


Some of the icons of the Ascension Monastery were made over to the 
State Tretyakov Gallery and State museums of the Moscow Kremlin. The 
iconostasis of the Ascension Cathedral was moved into the 
Cathedral of Twelve Apostles (also in the Kremlin), while the tombs of the Muscovite royalty were transferred into an annex of the 
Archangel Cathedral, where they reside to this day.

Stews

Spanish cuisine




In the 



Spanish


 region of 
La Rioja a variety of red kidney 
bean shorter and more rounded than usual is known as a caparron. By extension, the 
stew prepared with this bean is called caparrones, and it is one of the most important dishes of Riojan cooking. In its preparation, the local spicy sausage 
chorizo must not be absent.

Its cultural importance in the region can be compared to 






Asturian





 








fabada







. Caparrones are associated with 
strength, as well as with 
flatulence. There are some restaurants and 
inns in La Rioja that take this name (Meson los Caparrones, etc.).


This plant is widely cultivated in 
groves around La Rioja, and the most famous are from Anguiano. Rods obtained from branches of trees like 
poplar or bushes like 
elder and used for guiding the plant's growth are called palos de caparron (caparron staves). These staves are saved from one year to another tied in bunches called gavillas. There are also some varieties of caparrones called sin palo (without a stave) because they do not grow very tall and so do not require artificial support.

Susan Denberg (born 
2 August 
1944 in 
Bad Polzin, 

Germany
) is the stage name of an 

Austria
n 
model and 
actress. 
She was 

Playboy
 magazine's 
Playmate of the Month for its August 1966 issue. Her 
centerfold was photographed by 









Peter Gowland

Biography



Youth



Born in what would soon become part of 

Poland
, Susan grew up in Klagenfurt, 

Austria
.  For a time, she worked as a chorus girl in 

London
 and 

Las Vegas, Nevada
.  She came to 
Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, wanting to become a star.




Career



Denberg's  most famous acting role was in the film 

Frankenstein Created Woman
 - though her voice was dubbed. Her Austrian accent was considered to be too strong. This appears to be her final performance in a film.


Aside from her work in Playboy and the Frankenstein film she is best known as one of 





Harry Mudd




's mail-order brides in the  episode  
Mudd's Women .


When she was working on 





An American Dream




, 
Warner Brothers offered a $500 award for a contest to find Susan a new screen name.  All of the entries were rejected.


Her acting career was brief.  Over the years, rumors have abounded that Susan died of a drug overdose in 1967, or that she had mental health problems due to an addiction to 
LSD.  She is still alive, and living in 

Klagenfurt
, Austria.

The sphenoidal conchae (sphenoidal turbinated processes) are two thin, curved plates, situated at the anterior and lower part of the 
body of the sphenoid. An aperture of variable size exists in the anterior wall of each, and through this the sphenoidal sinus opens into the 
nasal cavity. 

Each is irregular in form, and tapers to a point behind, being broader and thinner in front. 


Its upper surface is concave, and looks toward the cavity of the sinus; its under surface is convex, and forms part of the roof of the corresponding nasal cavity. 


Each bone articulates in front with the 
ethmoid, laterally with the 
palatine; its pointed posterior extremity is placed above the 
vomer, and is received between the root of the pterygoid process laterally and the 
rostrum of the sphenoid medially. 


A small portion of the sphenoidal concha sometimes enters into the formation of the medial wall of the orbit, between the 
lamina papyracea of the 
ethmoid in front, the 
orbital plate of the palatine below, and the 
frontal bone above.

Puppetry
Comedy








A chinface, sometimes referred to as a chinhead, chinman, or chinmonster is a 
performance, usually of a 
comical nature, involving someone's chin. By drawing or attaching eyes, it gives the impression of a distorted face when viewed upside down.



Origins


In 1964, 


Bob Denver

 performed a chin face in the 
beach party film,  
For Those Who Think Young .


In 1988, McEwans Lager launched a new TV ad campaign featuring 'The Chinheads', a fictional and quirky 'upside-down' rock/soul band. The award-winning TV advert was directed by 







Steve Barron






 (director of 









Michael Jackson








's  

Billie Jean
 , 
A-Ha's  

Take on Me
 , and 

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
) and featured the track  Something So Real  by Scottish band, The Love Decree. A single was subsequently released in 1989 and charted nationally, peaking at No.61 (No.1, Outselling 

Black Box
's  

Ride on Time
  in Scotland).







Ben Elton



's 1990 television show 
The Man from Auntie featured several chinface performances.


In 1993, an episode of 
Red Dwarf,  Gunmen of the Apocalypse , used chinface when the crew had to convince a ship of simulants (artificially created, 
cyborg humanoids) that there were no humans aboard, insisting instead that the ship was crewed by curry-based lifeforms known as  
Vindaloovians .




Popular culture


Since 
video hosting sites have become available on the 
internet, chinface videos have become increasingly common.


In the mid 1990s, 
Kraft 

Canada
 released TV ads for 




Kraft Dinner



 featuring various people performing chinfaces and eating the product.


The 
video game 








You Don't Know Jack







 featured as an ending to Volume 4 (The Ride) footage showing part of the hosts' faces. The character Guy Towers is portrayed as a chin face, with oversized glasses.


Disc 4 of the 

Jackass
 DVD Box Set features 

Chris Pontius
 performing a chinface of a  Latvian Gangster  during a running of the 
Gumball 3000.





They Might Be Giants

' first video, for their song  Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head , features one of them doing the chinface, with a xeroxed picture of his eyes placed on his chin.


In the 

Atomic Brain
 episode of 

Mystery Science Theater 3000
, 
Mike Nelson demonstrates to the 'bots a  chin face .  He says that the tradition is  fun...whimsical ; 

Crow
 counters that it is  odd and disturbing .

Wave Action Surf Magazine is a publication about 
surfing.


Wave Action Magazine began in a small apartment in 

Huntington Beach, California
 through the vision of Mike Freihofer and Pete Rocky. Both surfers had been working at a local Southern California Surf Magazine called International Surf, published by Steve Zeldin (who now publishes Foam and Water magazines). The two, along with friends Tracy Mikulec and Jake Knight came together to create a simple yet important print media business. Wave Action was the first title that emerged from the 
World Oceans Media brand. September 1993 was the launch with Wave Action Surf Magazine {the late Todd Chesser was on the cover) started with a micro sized budget and support through industry friends.


Wave Action eventually spun off four sister publications and graduated from that small garage in HB to a larger one in 
San Clemente. Years passed and the support behind Wave Action continued to grow and in the process made a fairly significant impact for the two other giant publications within the sport Surfer and Surfing. Wave Actions  All Grom Issue  set the footprint for Surfer Magazines  Hot 100 .  It also led Surfing Magazine to devote a great deal of attention to the future champions of the sport rather than only covering the ASP contenders of the day.


Essentially, Wave Action set the pace for the youth movement that ran full speed through the 1990s and into the early 2000s. It also laid the foundation for publications such as Transworld Surf and other global action sports magazines.

Radu Sirbu (also known as Radu Sarbu, RadU, and Picasso) is a 



Moldovan


 singer. He was born on 
December 14, 
1978, in 
Peresecina, 

Moldova
. He was part of the former 
boyband 



O-Zone


 and currently lives   works in 

Bucharest
, 

Romania
.



 Biography 



Radu Sirbu, now 29, was the oldest member of the former band O-Zone.


Radu spent most of his childhood in his hometown, however, he moved to 

Orhei
 and 
B l i for a time. He went back to Peresecina after the 9th grade in order to finish high school. During the 10th and 11th grade, he worked as a DJ at his father's nightclub, and organized musical theatre shows through his studio,  Artshow,  which he created for children and teens. In 1996, after graduating, he began his studies at the 
Chi in u Music Conservatory, as well as teaching vocal classes for children on the side.


In 2001, a man named 
Dan B lan was holding casting calls for a band to be called O-Zone. O-Zone used to consist of just Dan and his friend 
Petru Jelihovski, but even after Petru dropped out, Dan still desired to continue his musical career - hopefully with two others. 
Arsenie Todira  (nicknamed  Arsenium ) had auditioned successfully, then Radu joined to become the third and final member. As a group, O-Zone became extremely popular in their home country of Moldova, and were able to branch out to their neighbour, 

Romania
. What came after defined the height of their careers: with the release of two chart-topping albums, Number 1 in 2002 and DiscO-Zone in 2004, they found themselves constantly played on the airwaves throughout Europe, and became fans of many listeners. 


O-Zone's dance-pop music consisted of beats and catchy lyrics, able to surpass any language barrier. As Radu himself said, their songs have  positive emotion  - it really doesn't matter if you can't speak or understand Romanian, you just  feel the love  in the music. O-Zone later became well known in 

France
, 



Italy


, 

Germany
, 

Romania
 and the 











United Kingdom










. Their most popular hits included  

Despre tine
  and  

Dragostea din tei
 . Later, 



Gary Brolsma


 of 

New Jersey
 made an internet video dance to the song  Dragostea din tei , entitled 





Numa Numa




. Gary's internet video helped the group become known in 








America







.  


In January 2005, Dan, Arsenie, and Radu announced that O-Zone disbanded, deciding instead to focus on their respective solo careers. With Dan in America making rock music with his band  Balan , and Arsenie launching in Germany under the name 
Arsenium, Radu is also working on his solo project. In 2005, he worked together with DJ Mahay and released a song called  Dulce . RadU (as this is his new stage name) currently lives in Romania with his wife, and his daughter, Anastasia Dalia, and he's working on getting his official Website up at 
RaduSirbu.ro. He made a video on his song called  Whap-pa  and released his album Alone, and more recently he's releasing his single  Doi str ini  ( Two strangers ), and made a video for it. In 2007 he and Arsenium got together and released the single  July .




 MR.  MS. Project 


As of March 2008, Radu is currently working on a new project called MR.   MS. He is working with another female, whose name so far has been kept secret.  Jun. 2008 he appeared on the Romanian talk show  Teo   on Antena 1 and it has been revealed that the female singer is his wife. They released the single  
Love Is Not A Reason To Cry  in late March 2008.

People from Mecklenburg-Schwerin




Friedrich Bernard Christian Maassen (
September 24, 
1823   
April 9, 
1900) was a 

German
 
jurist, 
professor of law, and 


Roman Catholic

 scholar.

Maasen was born in 


Wismar

, 

Mecklenburg-Schwerin
. After studying the humanities in his native city, he studied 
jurisprudence at 

Jena
, 
Berlin, 

Kiel
 and finally 

Rostock
, where in 1849 as an advocate, he took his degree at the university there in 1851. He was active in the 
constitutional conflict of 1848 between the 
Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the 
Diet, defending the rights of the representatives in three pamphlets, and, together with 
Franz von Florencourt, founded the anti-revolutionary  Norddeutscher Korrespondent . Shortly after his graduation he became a convert to 
Roman Catholicism. Later realizing that, as a Catholic, he was no longer eligible for public office in his native town, he travelled to 

Bonn
, where he devoted himself to academic teaching. 


Maassen's 
magnum opus, Der Primat des Bischofs von Rom und die alten Patriarchalkirchen (Bonn, 1853), dealt with two important questions: whether the Roman primacy had existed in the first centuries, and whether the much-discussed sixth canon of the 

First Council of Nicaea
 bears witness to the primacy. This work won immediate recognition among scholars, and 
Count Thun invited him to 
Pesth in 1855 as professor extraordinarius of Roman Law. Several months later, he was given a professorship of Roman and canon law at Innsbruck, one at 


Graz

 in 1860, and one in 1871 at 


Vienna

, where, until he retired in 1894, he attracted many pupils.


In 1873 he became a member of the 
Vienna Academy of Sciences, in 1885 a life member of the Upper House, and from 1882 till 1897 was a member of the 
Supreme Court of the Empire. During the 
Vatican Council he adhered to 
Dollinger, but was in no real sense an 
Old Catholic, and in 1882 explicitly retracted all his utterances in favour of that sect. Incited by 
Savigny's important work on the history of Roman law in the 
Middle Ages, Maassen began a history of canon law on the same lines. But of this work, which was to have numbered five volumes, he published only the first,  Geschichte der Quellen und der Literatur des kanonischen Rechts im Abendlande bis zum Ausgang des Mittelalters  (Graz, 1870). Several of his articles in the Report (Sitzungsberichte) of the Vienna Academy were practically complements of this work. His  Neun Kapitel uber freie Kirche und Fewissenfreiheit  (Graz, 1876) is written in a vehement style; a sweeping condemnation of the 

Prussian
 
Kulturkampf. An amplification of the first chapter appeared under the title:  Ueber die Grunde des Kampfes zwischen dem heidnischen Staate und dem Christentum  (Vienna, 1882). In many respects his  Pseudoisidorstudien  (Vienna, 1885) is a continuation of his masterpiece. He also edited in masterly style one volume of the great  Monumenta Germania Historica: Leges , III (Hanover, 1893), being the  Concilia avi Merovingensis . Noteworthy, also, is his  Zwei Synoden unter Childeric II  (Graz, 1867). Maassen was often perceived as an aggressive political tactician. He was an adherent of the so-called 
Federalismus, and strove energetically for the formation of a Catholic Conservative party in Styria, where he belonged for a time to the 
Diet.


Maassen died in 
Wilten near 

Innsbruck
.

Heshang Moheyan (     ; 
Wade-Giles:Ho-shang Mo-ho-yen; Heshang Moh y n or Hvashang Moheyan in Tibetan sources) was a late eighth century CE 
Chan monk associated with the 
Northern School and famous for representing Chan vs. Indian Buddhism in a debate that is supposed to have set the course of 


Tibetan Buddhism

.  Hva-shang is a Tibetan approximation of the Chinese hoshang, meaning monk. Hoshang in turn comes from the Sanskrit title upadhyaya.1


An iconographic

Pennsylvania




.



Dunhuang sojourn


Whilst the East Mountain Teachings (pejoratively known as the  
Northern School  Chan) were in decline, having been attacked by 
Heze Shenhui (a student of 
Dajian Huineng) as a supposed  gradual enlightenment  teaching, Moheyan  traveled to 











Dunhuang










, which at the time belonged to the 
Tibetan Empire, in 781 or 787 CE.2  For Moheyan, this was a new opportunity for the spread of (Northern) Chan.
3




Council of Lhasa


After teaching in the area of 











Dunhuang










, Moheyan was invited by King 










Trisong Detsen









 of 





Tibet




 to settle at 
Samye Monastery, then the center of emerging Tibetan Buddhism.4. Moheyan promulgated a variety of 
Chan and disseminated teachings from Samye where he attracted a considerable number of followers.





The main building of the Samye Monastery





However, in 
793 Trisong Detsen resolved that Moheyan did not hold the true 


Dharma

. Following intense protests from Moheyan s supporters, Trisong Detsen proposed to settle the matter by sponsoring a debate:  
dialectic is an ancient aspect of the 

Indian
 and 
Chinese religions, as it is in 
Himalayan tradition. The most famous of these debates has become known as the  Council of Lhasa , although it may have taken place at Samye, a considerable distance from 

Lhasa
. For the famed Council of Lhasa, an Indian monk named 
Kamala ila was invited to represent 
Indian Buddhism, while Moheyan represented 
Northern School 
Chan and 
Chinese Buddhism. Most Tibetan sources state that the debate was decided in Kamasila s favour (though many Chinese sources claim Moheyan won)5 and Moheyan was required to leave the country and that all sudden-enlightenment texts were gathered and destroyed by royal decree. This was a pivotal event in the history of 


Tibetan Buddhism

, which would afterward continue to follow the late Indian model with only minor influence from 
China.
http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Moheyan#endnote_Yamaguchi Moheyan s teachings were a mixture of the 'East Mountain Teachings' {Chinese: tung-shan fa-men; given the appellation of  Northern School  Chan by Shenhui (670-762)} associated with 
Shenxiu and 
Baotang Chan.

Moheyan s teaching


Most of what is known of Moheyan s teaching comes from fragments of writings in Chinese and Tibetan found in the 
Mogao caves at 











Dunhuang










, 

Gansu
, 
China. The manuscript given the appellation IOL Tib J 7096 is a collection of nine Chan texts, commencing with the teachings of Moheyan.7


Moheyan taught in the tradition of the  sudden enlightenment  school of Southern Chan (as opposed to the  gradualist  school of Northern Chan). This dichotomy is a historical construction as both Northern and Southern Schools contained 'gradualist teachings' (Chinese: tun-men) and 'sudden teachings' (Chinese: chien-men) and practices. Moheyan held that all thought (thinking and ideation) prevented enlightenment:  Not thinking, not pondering, non-examination, non-apprehension of an object---this is the immediate access [to liberation]. 8 He also believed that carrying out good or evil acts leads to transmigration rather than liberation as these acts  lead to heaven or hell.  9 


An important aspect of Moheyan s teaching was that if all thought, good or bad, obscures enlightenment, then all actions must be based on the simplest principles of conduct. To achieve proper conduct, all conceptions, without exception should be seen as false:  If one sees conceptions as no conception, one sees the 
Tath gata.  10 To rid oneself of all conceptions, one must practice 
meditation, 
trance, and contemplating the mind:  To turn the light [of the mind] towards the mind s source, that is contemplating the mind.  one does not reflect on or observe whether thoughts are in movement or not, whether they are pure or not, whether they are empty or not.  11


While Moheyan took a radical approach to the achievement of enlightenment (and defended it vigorously), his position was weakened when questioned by, and entering into debate with, those people who could not meditate, who could not  turn the light of the mind towards the mind s source.  He conceded that practices such as the  perfection of morality , studying the sutras and teachings of the masters and cultivating meritorious actions were appropriate. These types of actions were seen as part of the  gradualist  school and Moheyan held that these were only necessary for those of  dim  facility and  dull  propensity. Those of  sharp  and  keen  facility and propensity do not need these practices as they have  direct  access to the truth through meditation. This concession to the  gradualists , that not everyone can achieve the highest state of meditation, left Moheyan open to attack on the basis of a dualistic approach to practice. To overcome these inconsistencies in his thesis, Moheyan claimed that when one gave up all conceptions, an automatic, all-at-once attainment of virtue resulted.  He taught that there was an  internal  practice to liberate the self ( 
prajn   or wisdom) and an  external  practice to liberate others ( 
upaya , or expedient means). These were seen as two independent practices, a concession to human psychology and scriptural tradition.




Legacy


The teachings of Moheyan and other Chan masters were unified with the 
Kham 










Dzogchen









 lineages {this may or may not be congruent with the Kahma (Tibetan: bka' ma) lineages} through the Kunkhyen (Tibetan for  
omniscient ), 
Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo.12


The Dzogchen ( Great Perfection ) School of the 
Nyingmapa was often identified with the 'sudden enlightenment' (Tibetan: cig car gyi  jug pa) of Moheyan and was called to defend itself against this charge by avowed members of the 



Sarma


 










lineages









 that held to the staunch view of 'gradual enlightenmnent' (Tibetan: rim gyis  jug pa).13




Iconography


According to Ying Chua (1998), Moheyan is often 
iconographically depicted holding a 
shankha (Sanskrit) and a 
mala (Sanskrit):


He is usually depicted as a rotund and jovial figure and holding a mala, or prayer beads in his left hand and a sankha, conch shell in his right. He is often considered a benefactor of children and is usually depicted with at least one or more playing children around him.14

This article is about Kermes, the mineral compound.  For other references, see 
Kermes.  

Kermes mineral  or Alkermes mineral (Sb2S3) is a compound of 
antimony oxides and 
sulphides, more specifically, antimony trioxide and trisulphide.     This substance occurs in nature as the mineral 

Kermesite
. It can be made or obtained in the laboratory by the actions of Potassium Carbonate (K2CO3) on antimony Sulphide.  The compound is reddish brown in color and described as a velvety powder which is insoluble in water.  It was used extensively in the medical field until the general use of 
antimony compounds declined due to toxic affects.



History and Uses


The name is derived from the word Kermes as denoting the compound s red color.  The origins of the term is from the 

French
 kermes,  which is short for alkermes, from the 

Arabic
 al-qirmiz a reference to 
crimson dye made from the bodies of insects (see 





Kermes (dye)




).  I was also known as 
poudre des Chartreux from a story of how it saved the life of a 






Carthusian





 monk in 
1714.   Because of its reputation as a medication and heal-all (or 
panacea), the formula and production process for Kermes mineral was purchased by the 

French
 government in 
1720.  Used for centuries in medicine as a health treatment, diaphoretic (causing sweat), anti-inflammatory and emetic it was used  through the 19th century and its use extended to 
epilepsy treatment in addition to hectic fever.

Binomial name



 Astrapia nigra(


Gmelin

, 1788)































The Arfak Astrapia, Astrapia nigra is a large, approximately 76cm long, black 
bird of paradise with an 
iridescent purple, green and bronze plumage. The male has a very long broad tail, velvety black breast feathers and extremely complex head plumage. The female is a blackish brown with pale barring on its abdomen.


Levaillant of 

France
 described this bird as L Incomparable or Incomparable Bird of Paradise.


An 

Indonesia
n 
endemic, the Arfak Astrapia is restricted to the 


Arfak Mountains

 in 
Vogelkop Peninsula, 
West Papua. The diet consists mainly of 
pandanus fruits.


In the wild, the bird has hybridised with the 




Black Sicklebill



 creating offspring that were once considered a distinct species, the Elliot's Sicklebill Epimachus ellioti. While some ornithologists still believe that this bird is a distinct species, possibly critically endangered or even extinct, many now think it was a hybrid between the two species.


Protected by its geographical isolation and undisturbed forests home, the Arfak Astrapia is evaluated as Least Concern on the 
IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of 
CITES.

Exit Records was an 
independent record label founded in 
1982 by 
Mary Neely, a veteran of the music business and longtime host for several national rock and roll radio shows, including 
Rockscope. The label folded in 
1987. 


Based in a large building on the west side of 

Sacramento
, Neely set up her label with the hopes of encouraging art and creativeness over commercial success. Exit began with two small releases from 

The 77s
 and 


Vector

, before signing a major production and distribution deal with 

A M Records
 and 

Island Records
. Included in the arrangement was a promotion deal with the legendary 


Bill Graham

 Productions.

Politics of Ethiopia
Human rights by country




According to the 
U.S. Department of State's human rights report for 2004 and similar sources, the Ethiopian government's human rights record is poor. The 

Ethiopia
n government does not respect the basic 
human rights of many of its citizens. Police and security forces have harassed, arbitrarily and illegally detained, tortured, and in some cases, killed members of the political opposition, demonstrators, and suspected insurgents. Thousands of suspects remain in detention without charge, and lengthy pretrial detention continues to be a problem. Prison conditions are poor. The government often ignores citizens' privacy rights and laws regarding search warrants. Although fewer journalists have been arrested, detained, or punished in 2004 than in past years, the government nevertheless continues to restrict 
freedom of the press. The government limits 
freedom of assembly, particularly for members of opposition groups, and security forces have used excessive force to break up demonstrations. Violence and discrimination against women continue to be problems. 

Female genital mutilation
 is widespread, although efforts to curb the practice have had some effect. The economic and sexual exploitation of children continues, as does 
human trafficking. 
Forced labor, particularly among children, is a persistent problem. Low-level government interference with 
labor unions continues. Although the government generally respects the free exercise of religion, local authorities at times interfere with religious practice.

It is claimed that in 
2005 police 
massacred opposition protesters. Live gunfire from government forces was directed at protesters and bystanders.


According to a report released by 
Human Rights Watch in June 2008, the Ethiopian army has committed widespread 
executions, 
torture and 
rape in 


Ogaden

, as part of a 
counterinsurgency campaign. 1

 Company History 





J.P. Leggett






C.B. Platt





In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, far removed from any major metropolitan or urban areas, a historical partnership began. J.P. Leggett, an inventor, initiated the partnership because he had developed an innovative bedspring. Mr. Leggett s bedspring consisted of single cone spring wire coils, formed and interlaced in a unique manner, then mounted on a wood slat base. The bedspring could then be used as a resilient, durable base for the then-popular cotton, feather or horsehair mattresses. Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be 
brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they perfected the equipment necessary to produce the components of their Leggett   Platt bedspring, which was patented in 1885. 





Bedspring vs. Innerspring



At the time of their invention, bedsprings referred to cone-shaped wire coiled springs, attached to a wooden slat foundation, used to support then-popular mattresses.  These mattresses were typically made of horse hair, corn husks, cotton, feathers, or another soft material.  Early bedsprings functioned similarly to today's box springs in their support of a mattress.  However, box springs are rather rigid in structure, while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface.



 
 Innersprings, by contrast, refer to the core system of wire springs that, along with various types of foam and other padding materials, comprise the insides of today's mattress.  The mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set.  Innersprings can be coiled springs laced together, continuous coil springs, or individually pocketed springs, that support a person sleeping on the mattress.





The Carthage market for their new product was very limited. To expand the market to a wider region, Mr. Platt and George Leggett, brother of J. P. Leggett, would load a horse-drawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities. Often, to conserve space, they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk. The partnership prospered, and the business was incorporated in 1901.





The Platt Plow Works





The company built its first factory and offices in Carthage in 1895. The workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees. Soon after completion of the Carthage plant, a second factory was built in Louisville, Kentucky. During the next 50 years, three more factories were built. Demand for the company s improved bedsprings was rising, and a second plant was built in Carthage in 1925. The new, much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies. In 1942, an additional factory was built in Winchester, Kentucky, which was subsequently consolidated with the Louisville plant. For some time, Texas had proven to be a main market outlet, and in 1947, a major factory was built in Ennis, Texas. By 1947, Leggett   Platt consisted of 4 plants and 500 employees.


Although available in various models and continuously improved upon, bedsprings were practically the only product Leggett   Platt offered until 1933. However, in that year the company began to manufacture springs for 
 innerspring mattresses, which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity. Thereafter, the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots, along with bed frames and bed rails.





Innerspring mattress components





In 1960, Harry M. Cornell Jr., J.P. Leggett s grandson, was elected President and CEO of the company, taking over for his father (who was Mr. Leggett s son-in-law). The company s total sales in 1960 were approximately $7 million from three states   Kentucky, Texas and Missouri. Determining the course and future of the company became management s primary objective. Following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential, Mr. Cornell and his management partners concluded that Leggett   Platt s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing, marketing, and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products, first nationally and eventually on a world-wide basis. Key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth initiatives, coupled with an active and ongoing acquisition program.





J.P. Leggett's original bedspring and patent





Even greater success followed, and Leggett   Platt became known as  the components people.  Leggett   Platt stock was first traded over the counter in 1967. Twelve years later, on June 25th, 1979, top management was present in New York City to witness the stock s first day listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1985, Leggett   Platt grew into the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S.-based manufacturing companies. In 1999, the company became part of the S P 500 Index. 


Today, Leggett   Platt products can be found nearly everywhere. Its operations encompass over 250 manufacturing plants, distribution centers and other facilities in more than 20 countries. Employee-partners working in the various locations include 24,000 individuals   the people of Leggett   Platt are the company s greatest asset.

Environmental Record


Researchers at the 

University of Massachusetts Amherst
 have identified Leggett   Platt as the 54th-largest corporate producer of 
air pollution in the United States, with roughly 150,000 pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.1 
Major pollutants indicated by the study include 
sulfuric acid, 
nickel compounds, and 
diisocyanates.2


In 2007, Leggett   Platt s corporate office indicated that the US EPA Toxic Chemical Release Data used by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (and referenced above) is from the year 2000.  Data for 2006 shows total on-site air releases from the Leggett   Platt facilities listed in the 2000 report have declined by more than 90% since 2000, to less than 2,500 pounds.  These reductions resulted, in part, from the following action by Leggett   Platt over the past seven years:  a) removal of the sulfuric acid cleaning operation and nickel plating bath at Talbot Industries; b) replacement of methylene chloride at polyurethane foam plants with a Cardio process that uses carbon dioxide as a blowing agent; c) installation of powder paint lines and low VOC paint systems to replace solvent coating operations; and d) use of low VOC and water based cleaning solvents at Pulsar Plastics rather than methyl ethyl ketone.
