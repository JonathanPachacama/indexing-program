History



Colquitt County became the 115th county in 

Georgia
 by an act of the Legislature on 
February 25, 
1856. It was named after 
Walter Terry Colquittt, a minister, statesman and lawyer who was a military leader in the mid 1860's. In 1879, a charter was adopted and 50 acres (0 km2) in the center of the county was declared the county seat. It was named Moultrie, after Gen. 






















William Moultrie





















, a Revolutionary War hero. 


During the 

American Civil War
 Colquitt County raised several companies of 

Confederate

Founders of naval stores started harvesting the timbers in the late 1890s. They set up 
turpentine stills and built 
tram roads, allowing for the railroad to come into the territory. The 
Boston   Albany line, which later became the 




Georgia Northern Railway



, was the first through town, bringing with it  growth and prosperity for the County. Practically every train brought new residents interested in supplying naval stores or working in the saw mills.


By 1900, through the work of businessmen, bankers and speculators, the county was becoming a farmer's paradise. Land was cleared and development companies began dividing the forested area into farm tracts. Experienced farmers from north Georgia and the Carolinas were invited to come and develop the land. The county's agriculture industry thrives today.

Allegan





Douglas (officially known as the City of the Village of Douglas) is a city in 

Allegan County
 in the 








U.S. state







 of 

Michigan
.  The population was 1,214 at the 2000 census. The city is surrounded by 

Saugatuck Township
 and the city of 

Saugatuck
 is adjacent on the north. 

On 
December 13, 
2004, residents voted to adopt a charter changing the status of the village into a city form of government. Under Michigan law, cities are independent entities whereas villages are part of the township. The official name is City of the Village of Douglas.


Douglas, originally known as Dudleyville, was first settled in 1851 as a lumber mill town. In 1861, residents changed the name to Douglas. Reportedly the name was chosen to honor the American statesman 

Stephen A. Douglas
, but other reports indicate that a relative of the original owner of the land also suggested the name because he came from 

Douglas
, the capital of the 












Isle of Man











. Douglas was incorporated as a village in 1870. 


Area sawmills provided much of the lumber used to rebuild 

Chicago
 after the 
Great Chicago Fire of 1871. After most of the harvestable trees in the area were cleared by the lumber industry,  the area became a center for growing and shipping fruit, especially 
peaches. 
Tourism and resorts also became an important part of the area economy.

Saginaw is a city in the 








U.S. state







 of 

Michigan
 and the seat of 

Saginaw County

Flint/Tri-Cities

 region of Michigan. The city is adjacent to 

Saginaw Charter Township
 and considered part of the 


Tri-Cities

Bay City
,

History





Main article: 
History of Saginaw, Michigan

The site of what is presently the City of Saginaw was originally inhabited by Native Americans. The 
Sauk lived in the area and were driven from the area by 
Ojibwe (Chippewa). The name Saginaw is believed to mean  where the Sauk were  in the Ojibwe language. French missionaries and traders first appeared in the area during the late 1600s. The first permanent settlement by those other than Native Americans was in 1815 when 






Louis Campau





 established a trading post on the west bank of the Saginaw River. Shortly thereafter the United States established Fort Saginaw.


During Michigan's territorial period, a county and township government were organized at Saginaw. Growth of the settlement was fueled rapidly during the 1800s by the lumber industry. Saginaw was the site of numerous sawmills and served as a port for Great Lakes vessels. What is now the City of Saginaw resulted from the consolidation of the Cities of East Saginaw and Saginaw (West Side) in 1889.


During the 1900s, Saginaw's economy was dominated by manufacturing related to the automotive industry. Immigration from other areas, particularly the American south, swelled the population. This population growth particularly expanded the presence of African-Americans in Saginaw. The politics of the City became dominated with issues of race relations. The manufacturing presence in Saginaw declined in the latter half of the 20th century and the population diminished as well. Saginaw has faced increasing social problems relating to poverty as a result of its high rate of unemployment. Crime has been a major area of concern for the community in recent years.

 Law and government 



 Government 





Main article: 
Government of Saginaw, Michigan

Saginaw is classified as a Home Rule City under the Michigan 






Home Rule Cities Act





 which permits cities to exercise  
Home Rule  powers, among which is the power to frame and adopt its own 
City Charter which serves as the fundamental law of the city, in a manner similar to a 
Constitution for a national or state government. The present Charter was adopted in 1935 and took effect on 
January 6, 
1936. Pursuant to the City Charter, Saginaw is governed by a nine member elected 
at-large Council. The term of office for a member of the 
City Council is four years commencing with the first meeting following a regular municipal election. The terms of Council members are staggered so that the entire Council is not subject to re-election at the same time; alternatively either four or five members are elected in each odd-numbered year.




 Crime 


As of 2006, the City's crime rate in major categories is well above the national average. The overall violent crime rate for 2006 was 4.55 times the national average.7 By comparison, 
Detroit, the largest city in Michigan, has an overall violent crime rate 3.38 times the national average.8 
Los Angeles, 

California
 with a population 3.8 million has 2.13 times the national average.9 Arson has been a notable problem in the city with the night before Halloween becoming known as  Devil's Night.  With 40 cases of arson on Devil's Night alone in 2006, local law enforcement and citizen groups created in 2007  Saginaw Arson Watch  as an attempt to reduce the pre-halloween arsons that have plagued the city. Citizens have considered the project  a resounding success  as only eight fires were reported during Devil's Night.10 In 2007, Saginaw was ranked the 14th most dangerous metropolitan area in the United States.11

 Infrastructure 





The water treatment facility in Saginaw was constructed in 1929.






 Utilities 



The City of Saginaw gets its electricity and natural gas from 





Consumers Energy




.



Municipal water supply


In 1929, the City opened its consolidated water works plant which replaced two separate plants that were on each side of the Saginaw river. This plant treated water brought in from the Saginaw river and piped it out to the residents as well as corner pumps for people that did not have direct connections to the system13. Currently, the City of Saginaw jointly owns with the City of Midland the Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation. Incorporated in 1946, this 
water treatment system has supplied drinking and industrial water to both cities and many surrounding areas within the county14. Due to brackish water being in the aquifers below both cities, a 65-mile (105 km) long pipeline was constructed in 1948 to supply water from 

Lake Huron
 at White Stone Point, north of 

Au Gres
 to water treatment plants in Saginaw and Midland13 with a second pipe added by 1996. This system has played a role in the decline of the city. The City of Saginaw, in order to provide obtain new sources of revenue, sold water to areas outside of the city. This led to numerous businesses inside the city to leave for the surrounding areas and development in the city to stagnate. The City of Midland however adopted a policy of  No Annexation, No Water  which has led to the growth of the city as well as the surrounding areas14.

Saginaw is served primarily by two airports; 

MBS International Airport
, located in nearby

, located in 

Flint

Wabasha





Zumbro Falls is a city in 

Wabasha County
, 





Minnesota




, 








United States







, along the 





Zumbro River




. The population was 177 at the 2000 census. The 
grist-mill 
dam built on Zumbro  river in 1866 created the falls for which the town is named. The river is the cause of numerous floods which swept away the dam except for a few remaining traces of it.

The original settlement on the south side of the river dates back to 1857. Floods and 
tornadoes prompted the relocation of settlement to the north of the river. Relocated Zumbro Falls saw the arrival of 
railroad in 1881 and the city was incorporated in 1898.

Hunts Point is a town located in the 








Eastside







, a region of 

King County, Washington
 and part of the 

Seattle metropolitan area
. The town is located on a small 
peninsula surrounded by 

Lake Washington
, and is near the

History




Leigh S. J. Hunt
, a resident of nearby 
Yarrow Point, acquired the 
property of Hunts Point some time after 1870. He wanted it so that he could cut down the tall evergreen trees which grew out at the end, obstructing his view of 
Seattle.


Around 1900, the property was taken over by 
Puget Sound National Bank and sold to a group of Seattle men who used it as a family retreat for Sunday 
picnics and summer 
camping.


Before the creation of the two 

Lake Washington
 bridges, residents commuted to Seattle via the Gazelle, a small 
ferry which chugged into 
Cozy Cove each morning at 7:15.


A 
clubhouse was built in 1913 at what is now 3655 Hunts Point Road. The clubhouse became the center of social activity on Hunts Point through the 1920s. That same year, the women of Hunts Point formed the charitable organization - 
The Eastside Circle of the Seattle Fruit and Flower Mission (later called 
The Overlake Service League) which continues to this day.


In the 1950s, 
Stan Sayer, owner of the famous Slo Mo unlimited 
hydroplane, housed the boat at the end of Hunts Point Road.


Hunts Point was officially incorporated on 
August 22, 
1955.



 1957 
Fairweather Basin developed, turning 
marshland into prime residential property.


 1960 - first 
sewers installed.


 1963 - 
Evergreen Point Bridge completed, putting Hunts Point only minutes from Seattle.


 1988 - 
Wetherill Nature Preserve dedicated

, the town has a total area of 0.3 
square miles (0.8

Symphonic black metal is a style of 
black metal that uses 
symphonic and 
orchestral elements. This may include the usage of melodic instruments found in the sections of a symphony orchestra (
string instruments, 
brass instruments, 
woodwinds and 
keys),  clean  or operatic vocals, guitars with less distortion, and song structures that are more defined or are inspired by symphonies. However, much of the characteristics of  traditional  black metal are retained, such as shrieked vocals, fast tempos and high pitched electric guitars often played with 
tremolo picking. 


Symphonic black metal is often confused with 
melodic black metal and 
gothic metal, as there are similarities and often overlapping between the styles.



Comparison with melodic black metal


Often, there is confusion between symphonic black metal and 
melodic black metal, as both are black metal subgenres, both have slower tempos, and both have a more defined song structure. That sometimes leads symphonic black metal bands to be erroneously classified as melodic black metal, and vice-versa.  However, symphonic black metal makes extensive usage of instruments found in symphonies, while melodic black metal focuses more on guitar melodies and solos. Most bands combine traits from both genres, though.




Comparison with gothic metal


There is also confusion between symphonic black metal and 
gothic metal. Traits such as female vocals and  clean  guitar riffs are used in both. The difference is that while symphonic black metal is a subgenre of black metal, gothic metal isn't. Also the guitar work on gothic metal is less distorted than in symphonic black metal. Apart from this, the symphonic elements synthesized in gothic metal are more influenced by classical music (so they express a stronger feeling of art and beauty), while in symphonic black metal, they are usually used to provide the music with a darker and more haunting background.


Nevertheless symphonic black metal, melodic black metal and gothic metal are often mixed together.

Joseph Nicephore Niepce


Chalon-sur-Saone, 

France







Joseph Nicephore Niepce (
March 7, 
1765   
July 5, 
1833) was a 

French
 
inventor, most noted as the inventor of 
photography and a 
pioneer in the field. He is well-known for taking some of the earliest photographs, dating to the 1820s.



Biography





Nicephore Niepce's earliest surviving photograph; taken in 1826.





Joseph Niepce was born on 
7 March 
1765 in 
Chalon-sur-Saone,

France
. He created the first permanent photograph, of a pigeon house and barn as seen from his window, in the summer of 1826.1 The photograph was made using a 
camera obscura and a sheet of pewter coated with 
bitumen of Judea, an asphalt that when exposed to light, hardened permanently. This first photograph was captured during an eight hour exposure, taking so much time that the sun passed overhead, illuminating both sides of the courtyard. 


Niepce did not have a steady enough hand to trace the inverted images created by the camera obscura, as was popular in his day, so he looked for a way to capture an image permanently.  He experimented with 
lithography2, which led him in his attempt to take a photograph using a 
camera obscura.  Niepce also experimented with 
silver chloride, which darkens when exposed to 
light, but eventually looked to the 
bitumen, which he used in his first successful attempt at capturing nature photographically. He dissolved the 
bitumen in lavender oil, a solvent often used in varnishes, and coated the sheet of pewter with this light capturing mixture.  He placed the sheet inside a 
camera obscura to capture the picture, and eight hours later removed it and washed it with lavender oil to remove the unexposed 
bitumen.


He began experimenting to set optical images in 1793. Some of his early experiments made images, but they faded very fast. It was said that he made the first long lasting images in 1824. The earliest known example of a Niepce photograph (or any other photograph) was created in June or July, 1826, according to some information. Niepce called his process 
heliography, which literally means  sun writing .


Starting in 18293 he began collaborating on improved photographic processes with 

Louis Daguerre
, and together they developed the 
physautotype, a process that used lavender oil. The partnership lasted until Niepce s death in 1833.  Daguerre continued with experimentation, eventually developing a process that little resembled that of Niepce.  He named this the  
Daguerreotype,  after himself.  He managed in 1839 to get the government of France to purchase his invention on behalf of the people of France.  The French government agreed to award a stipend to Daguerre of 6,000 Francs yearly for the rest of his life, and to give the estate of Niepce 4,000 Francs yearly.  This arrangement rankled with Niepce's son, who claimed Daguerre was reaping all the benefits of his father's years of work.  In some ways, he was right--for a good many years, Joseph Nicephore Niepce received little credit for his significant contribution to the development of 
photography.  Later historians have reclaimed Niepce from relative obscurity, and it is now generally recognized that his  heliographic  process was the first successful example of what we now call 
photography: an image created on a light-sensitive surface, by the action of light.  


In 2002, an earlier remaining photograph which had been taken by Niepce was found in a French photograph collection. The photograph was found to have been taken in 1825, and it was an image of an 
engraving of a young boy leading a horse into a stable. The photograph itself later sold for 450,000 
euros at an auction.4




Other inventions


None of Niepce's inventions have been officially acknowledged; those accredited to him are:






velocipede: In 1818 he developed a very strong interest for this ancestor of the bicycle without pedals and transmission and cousin of the 
dandy horse from 





Karl von Drais




. He built himself a model and called it the velocipede. Nicephore made quite a sensation running his contraption on the local country roads but he could not resist improving it by different means: the adjustable saddle among them. This velocipede with the saddle is exhibited at the Niepce Museum.In a letter to his brother, Nicephore thought of motorizing his machine, thus imagining the moped.



pyreolophore: This was the first internal combustion engine built, which was invented and patented by the Niepce brothers in 1807. Ten years later, they were the first in the world to make an engine work with a fuel injection system.



Marly Machine: It was in 1807 that the imperial government opened a competition to receive projects of hydraulic machines to replace the one that in Marly was used to deliver water to the 

Palace of Versailles
 from the 
Seine river . Built in 1684, the original machine located in 





Bougival




, on the Seine river, was pumping up water on a one kilometer distance and an upslope of 150 meters. The Niepce brothers imagined a new principle for the machine and improved it once more in 1809. The machine had undergone a lot of changes in many of its parts. The mechanism in the system was more elaborated: its pistons joined to the advantage of being more precise, another one that is to create far less resistance. They tested it many times, and the result was that with a drop of 4 feet 4 inches, it lifted to 11 feet the 7 /24 of the water it loses. But in December 1809 they got a message that they had waited too long and the Emperor took himself the decision to ask the engineer 
Perier (1742-1818) to build a fire machine, also known as a steam engine, to operate the pumps at Marly.






 Legacy 



The 


Niepce crater

 on the 
Moon has been named after him in recognition of his accomplishments.



As of 2008 Niepce's photograph, 
View from the Window at Le Gras, is on display in the 









Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center








 at the 

University of Texas at Austin
. The image was rediscovered in 1952 by historians Alison and 










Helmut Gernsheim

Human brain viewed from the underside, with the front of the brain at the top. Amygdalae are shown in dark red.



The amygdalae (

Latin
, also corpus amygdaloideum, singular amygdala, from 

Greek
         , amygdal , 'almond', 'tonsil', listed in the 









Gray's Anatomy








 as the nucleus amygdala)1 are almond-shaped groups of 
neurons located deep within the 
medial temporal lobes of the brain in complex vertebrates, including humans.2 Shown in research to perform a primary role in the processing and 
memory of 
emotional reactions, the amygdalae are considered part of the 
limbic system.3 



 Anatomical subdivisions 


The regions described as amygdalae encompass several 
nuclei with distinct functional traits.  Among these nuclei are the basolateral complex, the centromedial nucleus and the cortical nucleus. The basolateral complex can be further subdivided into the lateral, the basal and the accessory basal nuclei.4


Anatomically, the amygdala5 and more particularly, its centromedial nucleus,6
may be considered as a part of the 
basal ganglia.



 Connections 


The amygdalae send impulses to the 
hypothalamus for important activation of the 
sympathetic nervous system, to the 
thalamic reticular nucleus for increased reflexes, to the nuclei of the 
trigeminal nerve and 
facial nerve for facial expressions of fear, and to the 
ventral tegmental area, 
locus coeruleus, and 
laterodorsal tegmental nucleus for activation of 
dopamine, 
norepinephrine and 
epinephrine.4





The cortical nucleus is involved in the sense of smell and 
pheromone-processing. It receives input from the 
olfactory bulb and 
olfactory cortex. The lateral amygdalae, which send impulses to the rest of the basolateral complexes and to the centromedial nuclei, receive input from the sensory systems. The centromedial nuclei are the main outputs for the basolateral complexes, and are involved in emotional arousal in rats and cats.47





Emotional learning



In complex vertebrates, including humans, the amygdalae perform primary roles in the formation and storage of memories associated with emotional events. Research indicates that, during fear conditioning, sensory stimuli reach the basolateral complexes of the amygdalae, particularly the lateral nuclei, where they form associations with memories of the stimuli. The association between stimuli and the aversive events they predict may be mediated by 
long-term potentiation, a lingering potential for affected synapses to react more readily.3


Memories of emotional experiences imprinted in reactions of 
synapses in the lateral nuclei elicit fear behavior through connections with the central nucleus of the amygdalae. The central nuclei are involved in the genesis of many fear responses, including freezing (immobility), tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), increased respiration, and stress-hormone release. Damage to the amygdalae impairs both the acquisition and expression of Pavlovian 
fear conditioning, a form of 
classical conditioning of emotional responses.3


The amygdalae are also involved in appetitive (positive) conditioning. It seems that distinct neurons respond to positive and negative stimuli, but there is no clustering of these distinct neurons into clear anatomical nuclei.8


Different nuclei within the amygdala have different functions in appetitive conditioning.9




 Memory modulation


The amygdalae also are involved in the modulation of 
memory consolidation. Following any learning event, the 
long-term memory for the event is not instantaneously formed. Rather, information regarding the event is slowly assimilated into long-term storage over time (the duration of long-term memory storage can be life-long), a process referred to as memory consolidation, until it reaches a relatively permanent state. 


During the consolidation period, the memory can be modulated. In particular, it appears that emotional arousal following the learning event influences the strength of the subsequent memory for that event. Greater emotional arousal following a learning event enhances a person's retention of that event. Experiments have shown 
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060202182107.htm that administration of stress hormones to mice immediately after they learn something enhances their retention when they are tested two days later.


The amygdalae, especially the basolateral nuclei, are involved in mediating the effects of emotional arousal on the strength of the memory for the event, as shown by many laboratories including that of 
James McGaugh. These laboratories have trained animals on a variety of learning tasks and found that drugs injected into the amygdala after training affect the animals' subsequent retention of the task. These tasks include basic 
classical conditioning tasks such as inhibitory avoidance, where a rat learns to associate a mild footshock with a particular compartment of an apparatus, and more complex tasks such as spatial or cued water maze, where a rat learns to swim to a platform to escape the water. If a drug that activates the amygdalae is injected into the amygdalae, the animals had better memory for the training in the task.10 If a drug that inactivates the amygdalae is injected, the animals had impaired memory for the task. 


Despite the importance of the amygdalae in modulating memory consolidation, however, learning can occur without it, though such learning appears to be impaired, as in fear conditioning impairments following amygdalar damage.11


Evidence from work with humans indicates that the amygdala plays a similar role. Amygdala activity at the time of encoding information correlates with retention for that information. However, this correlation depends on the relative  emotionalness  of the information. More emotionally-arousing information increases amygdalar activity, and that activity correlates with retention.




Neuropsychological correlates of amygdala activity


Early  research on primates provided explanations as to the functions of the amygdala, as well as a basis for further research. As early as 1888, rhesus monkeys with a lesioned temporal cortex (including the amygdala) were observed to have significant social and emotional deficits.12 
Heinrich Kluver and Paul Bucy later expanded upon this same observation by showing that large lesions to the anterior temporal lobe produced noticeable changes, including overreaction to all objects, hypoemotionality, loss of fear, 
hypersexuality, and hyperorality, a condition in which inappropriate objects are placed in the mouth. Some monkeys also displayed an 
inability to recognize familiar objects and would approach animate and inanimate objects indiscriminately, exhibiting a loss of fear towards the experimenters. This behavioral disorder was later named 
Kluver-Bucy syndrome accordingly.13 Later studies served to focus on the amygdala specifically, as the temporal cortex encompasses a broad set of brain structures, making it difficult to find which ones specifically may have correlated with certain symptoms. Monkey mothers who had amygdala damage showed a reduction in maternal behaviors towards their infants, often physically abusing or neglecting them.14 In 1981, researchers found that selective radio frequency lesions of the whole amygdala caused Kluver-Bucy Syndrome.15 


With advances in neuroimaging technology such as 
MRI, neuroscientists have made significant findings concerning the amygdala in the human brain. Consensus of data shows the amygdala has a substantial role in mental states, and is related to many 
psychological disorders. In a 2003 study, subjects with 
Borderline personality disorder showed significantly greater left amygdala activity than normal control subjects. Some borderline patients even had difficulties classifying neutral faces or saw them as threatening.16 In 2006, researchers observed 
hyperactivity in the amygdala when patients were shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening situations. Patients with more severe 
social phobia showed a correlation with increased response in the amygdala.17 Similarly, depressed patients showed exaggerated left amygdala activity when interpreting emotions for all faces, and especially for fearful faces. Interestingly, this hyperactivity was normalized when patients went on 
antidepressants.18 By contrast, the amygdala has been observed to relate differently in people with 
Bipolar Disorder. A 2003 study found that adult and adolescent bipolar patients tended to have considerably smaller amygdala volumes and somewhat smaller 
hippocampal volumes.19 Many studies have focused on the connections between the amygdala and 
autism.20


Studies in 2004 and 2006 showed that normal subjects exposed to images of frightened faces or faces of people from another race will show increased activity of the amygdala, even if that exposure is 
subliminal.2122


Recent research suggests that parasites, in particular 
toxoplasma, form cysts in the brain, often taking up residence in the amygdala. This may provide clues as to how specific parasites manipulate behavior and may contribute to the development of disorders, including paranoia.23

Samson and Delilah, by 







Anthony van Dyck






 (1599-1641)



This article is about Biblical figure.  For other uses, see 
Samson (disambiguation).
Samson, Shimshon (

Hebrew
:      ', 

Standard
  im on 



Tiberian


  im on; meaning  of the sun    perhaps proclaiming he was radiant and mighty, or  [One who] Serves [God] ) or Shamshoun       (Arabic) is the third to last of the 










Judges









 of the ancient 
Children of Israel mentioned in the 

Tanakh
 (the 
Hebrew Bible), and the 
Talmud. He is described in the 














Book of Judges













 chapters 13 to 16.12  He is believed to be buried in 
Tel Tzora in 

Israel
 overlooking the 
Sorek valley. There reside two large gravestones of Samson and his father Manoah. Nearby stands Manoach s altar (Judges 13:19-24).3 It is located between the cities of 








Zorah







 and 

Eshtaol
.

Samson is a 








Herculean







 figure, who is granted tremendous strength through the Spirit of the Lord to combat his enemies and perform heroic feats unachievable by ordinary men:4 wrestling a lion,25 slaying an entire army with nothing more than a donkey's jawbone,125 and tearing down an entire building.62


Joan Comay, co-author of Who's Who in the Bible:The Old Testament and the Apocrypha, The New Testament, believes that the biblical story of Samson is so specific concerning time and place that Samson was undoubtedly a real person, who pitted his great strength against the oppressors of Israel.6



Biblical narrative

 
Samson's activity takes place during a time when God was punishing the Israelites, by giving them  into the hand of the 
Philistines. 7 An 
angel appears to 
Manoah, an Israelite from the 
tribe of Dan, in the city of 








Zorah







, and to his wife, who had been unable to conceive.18 This angel proclaims that the couple will soon have a son who will begin to deliver the Israelites from the Philistines.8 The wife believed the angel, but her husband wasn't present, at first, and wanted the heavenly messenger to return, asking that he himself could also receive instruction about the child that was going to be born. Requirements were set up by the angel that Manoah's wife (as well as the child himself) is to abstain from all 
alcoholic beverages, and her promised child is not to shave or cut his hair. He was to be a  Nazirite  from birth. In ancient Israel, those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for awhile could take a nazirite vow, which included things like the aforementioned  as well as other stipulations. 18 After the angel returned, Manoah soon prepared a sacrifice, but the Messenger would only allow it to be for God, touching his staff to it, miraculously engulfing it in flames. The angel then ascended to Heaven in the fire. This was such dramatic evidence as to the nature of the messenger, that Manoah feared for his life, as it has been said that no-one can live after seeing God; however, his wife soon convinced him that if God planned to slay them, He would never have revealed such things to them to begin with. In due time the son, Samson, is born; he is reared according to these provisions.8







When he becomes a young man, Samson leaves the hills of his people to see the cities of the Philistines. While there, Samson falls in love with a Philistine woman from 








Timnah







 that, overcoming the objections of his parents who do not know that  it is of the Lord , he decides to marry her.89 The intended marriage is actually part of God's plan to strike at the Philistines.8 On the way to ask for the woman's hand in marriage, Samson is attacked by an 




Asiatic Lion



 and simply grabs it and rips it apart, as the Spirit of God moves upon him, divinely empowering him. This so profoundly affects Samson that he just keeps it to himself as a secret. 85 He continues on to the Philistine's house, winning her hand in marriage. On his way to the wedding, Samson notices that bees have nested in the carcass of the lion and have made honey.85 He eats a handful of the honey and gives some to his parents.8 At the wedding-feast, Samson proposes that he tell a riddle to his thirty groomsmen (all Philistines); if they can solve it, he will give them thirty pieces of fine linen and garments.8 The riddle ( Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet. ) is a veiled account of his second encounter with the lion (at which only he was present).85 The Philistines are infuriated by the riddle.8 The thirty groomsmen tell Samson's new wife that they will burn her and her father's household if she does not discover the answer to the riddle and tell it to them.85 At the urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson tells her the solution, and she tells it to the thirty groomsmen.8
Before sunset on the seventh day they said to him, 


 What is sweeter than honey? 

:and what is stronger than a lion?  
Samson said to them, 


 If you had not plowed with my heifer, 

:you would not have solved my riddle. 109
He flies into a rage and kills thirty Philistines of 










Ashkelon









 for their garments, which he gives his thirty groomsmen.510 Still in a rage, he returns to his father's house, and his bride is given to the best man as his wife.510
Her father refuses to allow him to see her, and wishes to give Samson the younger sister.10 Samson attaches torches to the tails of three hundred foxes, leaving the panicked beasts to run through the fields of the Philistines, burning all in their wake.510 The Philistines find out why Samson burned their crops, and they burn Samson's wife and father-in-law to death.1110 In revenge, Samson slaughters many more Philistines, smiting them  hip and thigh. 10


Samson then takes refuge in a cave in the 
rock of Etam.1012 An army of Philistines went up and demanded from 3,000 men of 



Judah


 to deliver them Samson.12 With Samson's consent, they tie him with two new ropes and are about to hand him over to the Philistines when he breaks free.11 Using the jawbone of an 
ass, he slays one thousand Philistines.211  At the conclusion of Judges 15 it is said that  Samson led Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines. 13





Samson and Delilah, by 






Francesco Morone











Later, Samson goes to 








Gaza







, where he stays at a harlot's house.1014 His enemies wait at the gate of the city to ambush him, but he rips the gate up and carries it to  the hill that is in front of 








Hebron







. 1014


He then falls in love with a woman, 
Delilah, at the 
Brook of Sorek.111014 The Philistines approach Delilah and induce her (with 1100 silver coins each) to try to find the secret of Samson's strength.1014 Samson obviously does not want to tell the secret, so at first he teases her, telling her that he can be bound with fresh bowstrings.1014 She does so while he sleeps, but when he wakes up he snaps the strings.1014 She persists, and he tells her he can be bound with new ropes. She binds him with new ropes while he sleeps, and he snaps them, too.1014 She asks again, and he says he can be bound if his locks are woven together.1014 She weaves them together, but he undoes them when he wakes.1014 Eventually Samson tells Delilah that he will lose his strength with the loss of his 
hair.11101415 Delilah calls for a servant to shave Samson's seven locks.101415 Since that breaks the Nazarite oath, God leaves him, and Samson is captured by the Philistines.21014 They burn out his eyes by holding a hot poker near them.14 After being blinded, Samson is brought to Gaza, imprisoned, and put to work grinding grain.14


One day the Philistine leaders assemble in a temple for a religious sacrifice to 



Dagon


, one of their most important gods, for having delivered Samson into their hands.1416 They summon Samson so that he may entertain them.1416 Three thousand more men and women gather on the roof to watch.141516 Once inside the temple, Samson, his hair having grown long again, asks the servant who is leading him to the temple's central pillars if he may lean against them (referring to the pillars).111416




 Then Samson prayed to the 
Lord, 'O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.' (Judges 16:28). 21416  Samson said, 'Let me die with the Philistines!' (Judges 16:30)16 Down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it.2111516 Thus he killed many more as he died than while he lived.  (Judges 16:30).1117 


After his death, Samson's family recovers his body from the rubble and buries him near the tomb of his father Manoah.16


The fate of Delilah is never mentioned15




In rabbinic literature



Rabbinical literature identifies Samson with 
Bedan;12 Bedan was a Judge mentioned by 














Samuel













 in his farewell address (






1 Samuel





 12:11) among the Judges that delivered Israel from their enemies. However, the name  Bedan  is not found in the Book of Judges.18  The name  Samson  is derived from the Hebrew word  shemesh , which means the sun, so that Samson bore the name of God, who is called  a sun and shield  in 
 Psalms 84:11; and as God protected Israel, so did Samson watch over it in his generation, judging the people even as did God.12 Samson's strength was divinely derived (Talmud, Tractate Sotah 10a); and he further resembled God in requiring neither aid nor help.1912


Jewish legend records that Samson's shoulders were sixty 
ells broad.12 He was lame in both feet 20, but when the spirit of God came upon him he could step with one stride from 








Zorah







 to 

Eshtaol
, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance21.12 Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth,22 yet his superhuman strength, like 
Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.2312


In licentiousness he is compared with 
Amnon and 
Zimri, both of whom were punished for their sins.2412 Samson's eyes were put out because he had  followed them  too often.2512 It is said that in the twenty years during which Samson judged Israel he never required the least service from an Israelite 26, and he piously refrained from taking the name of God in vain.12 Therefore, as soon as he told Delilah that he was a 
Nazarite of God she immediately knew that he had spoken the truth 27.12 When he pulled down the temple of Dagon and killed himself and the Philistines the structure fell backward, so that he was not crushed, his family being thus enabled to find his body and to bury it in the tomb of his father 28.12 In the Talmudic period some seemed to have denied that Samson was a historic figure; and was regarded by such individuals as a purely mythological personage.12 This was viewed as heretical by the rabbis of the Talmud, and they refuted this view.12  The Talmud does so by giving the names of his mother, and states that he had a sister named  Nishyan  or  Nashyan  (variant reading).12




Modern speculation


Some evidence suggests that Samson's home tribe of Dan might have been related to the Philistines themselves.  Dan  might be another name for the tribe of 
Sea Peoples otherwise known as the 


Denyen

, Danuna, or 


Danaans

. If so, then Samson's origin might be entirely Aegean.29 


These speculations are in stark contrast to the historical depictions expressed in the Bible and are therefore mutually exclusive.

Charles Frank  Chuck  Mangione (born 
November 29, 
1940) is an American 
flugelhorn player and composer who achieved international success in 1978 with his jazz-pop single,  
Feels So Good . Mangione has released more than 30 albums since 1960.1


Early life and career



Born and raised in 

Rochester, New York
, Mangione and his pianist brother 












Gap











 led the Jazz Brothers group which recorded three albums for 






Riverside Records





. He attended the 

Eastman School of Music
 from 1958 to 1963, and afterwards joined 


Art Blakey

's Jazz Messengers, for which he filled the trumpet seat, previously held by greats such as 


Clifford Brown

, 



Kenny Dorham


, 







Bill Hardman






, and 

Lee Morgan
.2 Mangione served as director of the Eastman jazz ensemble from 1968 to 1972, and in 1970, he returned to recording with the album Friends and Love, recorded in concert with the 


Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra

 and numerous guest performers.3 His quartet with saxophonist 
Gerry Niewood was a popular concert and recording act throughout the 1970s.  Bellavia , recorded during this collaboration, won Mangione his first Grammy.4


Mangione's composition  Chase the Clouds Away  was used in the 1976 Olympic Games, with a later composition,  Give It All You Got , being used as the theme to the 






Winter Olympic Games





 of 1980, held in 

Lake Placid, New York
.5 He performed it live at the closing ceremonies, which were televised globally.6 A 1980 issue of 
Current Biography called  Feels So Good  the most recognized tune since   

Michelle
  by 





The Beatles




. Recently, smooth jazz stations throughout the United States have recognized Mangione's  Feels So Good  as their all-time number one song.7 He raised over $50,000 for St. John's Nursing Home at his 60th Birthday Bash Concert, held at 

Rochester
's 








Eastman Theatre

Acting career


In addition to music Chuck Mangione has had a recurring voice-acting role on the animated television series 
King of the Hill. In it he portrays himself as a celebrity spokesman for 
Mega Lo Mart, although his animated form looks much younger than his age would indicate. The first episode of King of the Hill featuring Mangione originally aired on 

Valentine's Day
, 1997. The episode featured an original score specifically recorded for the occasion. He continued to appear in episodes, a total of ten more up until 2003.9 After a long hiatus, the character of Chuck Mangione returned in a later episode entitled  

Lucky's Wedding Suit
 , in May of 2007. A recurring joke is that whatever tune he plays on his flugelhorn inevitably shifts into  Feels So Good  after a few bars.


In the 

Magnum, P.I.
 episode  Paradise Blues,  Chuck Mangione portrays a fellow night club act along with TC's (Roger E. Mosley's) former girlfriend. Chuck performs two singles and has lines near the end of the show.

A view of 









Malmesbury Abbey








 in 
Wiltshire, 

England
. The Abbey was completed in 1180 AD, and remains in use as the parish church of Malmesbury.







William of Malmesbury (c. 1080/1095 c. 1143), 






English historian of the 12th century





, was born about the year 1080/1095, in 
Wiltshire. His father was 


Norman

 and his mother English. He spent his whole life in 

England
 with his most productive working years as a 
monk at 









Malmesbury Abbey








.



Biography


The education William received at Malmesbury Abbey included a smattering of 
logic and 
physics; 
Moral philosophy and 
history, however, were the subjects to which he devoted most attention.  During the course of his studies, he amassed a collection of medieval histories, which inspired in him the idea for a popular account of English history, modeled on the 






Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum





 (Ecclesiastical History of the English People) of 

Bede
. William's obvious repect for Bede is apparent even within the preface of his history, where he professes his admiration for the man. 


In fulfilment of this idea, William produced around AD 1120 his first edition of the Gesta regum anglorum (Deeds of the English kings) which spanned from AD 449-1120.  He later edited and expanded it up to the year 1127, releasing a second edition dedicated to Earl Robert of Gloucester.  This second edition of the Gesta regum anglorum is now considered by modern scholars to be one of the great histories of England. William's first edition of the Gesta regum anglorum was followed by the Gesta pontificum anglorum (Deeds of the English Bishops) in 1125.


Around this time, William formed an acquaintance with Bishop 



Roger of Salisbury


, who had a castle at 

Malmesbury
.  It is possible that this acquaintance, coupled with the positive reception of his Gesta regum earned him the offered position of Abbot of Malmesbury Abbey in 1140.  William, however, preferred his duties as librarian and scholar and declined the offer. His one public appearance was made at the council of 

Winchester
 in 1141, in which the clergy declared for the empress 
Matilda. He continued his chronicles with the Historia Novella, or modern history, a three-book chronicle that stretched from A.D. 1128-1142, including important accounts of 









the anarchy








 of 


King Stephen's

 reign. This work breaks off abruptly at the end of 1142, with an unfulfilled promise that it will be continued. Presumably, William died before he could redeem his pledge.




Significance


He is lauded by many, including 



John Milton


, to be one of the best English historians of his time, and remains known for strong documentation and his clear, engaging writing style. A strong Latin stylist, he shows literary and historiographical instincts which are, for his time, remarkably sound. He is an authority of considerable value from 1066 onwards; many telling anecdotes and shrewd judgments on persons and events can be gleaned from his pages.  Some scholars criticize him for his atypical annalistic form, calling his chronology less than satisfactory and his arrangement of material careless.  But his works are still considered invaluable, and despite these shortcomings, William of Malmesbury remains one of the most celebrated English chroniclers of the 12th century.

The Philharmonia is an 
orchestra based in 

London
. Since 1995 it has been based in the 












Royal Festival Hall











. In Britain it is also the resident orchestra at 



De Montfort Hall


, 

Leicester
 and the 

Corn Exchange, Bedford
, as well as The Anvil, 

Basingstoke
.


Background


The orchestra was founded in 1945 by 






Walter Legge





, and although it gave live concerts occasionally, it was mainly intended to be a recording orchestra for 

EMI
, where Legge was an executive. 
Thomas Beecham led its debut concert in 1946, but he was rejected as the orchestra's principal conductor, following his attempts to take control of the orchestra and change its name. Beecham instead went on to found the 


Royal Philharmonic Orchestra

.1


In its early years, many prominent 
conductors made recordings with the ensemble, including 



















Arturo Toscanini


















 (released only in the 1990s due to the lack of Toscanini's approval) and 
Wilhelm Furtwangler.  However, 

Herbert von Karajan
 was most associated with the Philharmonia in its early years.  Whilst he never held an official title with the Philharmonia, Karajan built the orchestra into one of the finest ensembles in the world, and made numerous recordings, including all the Beethoven symphonies.


In 1954, Karajan was elected music director of the 
Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and subsequently curtailed his work with the Philharmonia.  Needing to find a new conductor for the orchestra, Legge turned to 













Otto Klemperer












, whose career was flagging at the time. This proved to be an inspired decision, and Klemperer's name became indelibly linked with the orchestra during an  Indian Summer  of great recordings.  In 1959, Klemperer was named music director for life.


On 
10 March 
1964, Legge announced that he was going to disband the Philharmonia Orchestra. At a recording session with 













Otto Klemperer












, a meeting was convened where those present unanimously agreed that they would not allow the Orchestra to be disbanded. Klemperer gave his immediate support, and on 
17 March 
1964 the Orchestra elected their own governing body and adopted the name New Philharmonia Orchestra. The inaugural concert of the New Philharmonia Orchestra under its own auspices took place on 
27 October 
1964. It was a performance of 

Beethoven
's 







Symphony No. 9






, conducted by Klemperer, who was now honorary president of the orchestra. From 1966 until 1972 the chairman of the orchestra was the principal flautist, 

Gareth Morris
.


The orchestra gave many more live performances after it became self-governing than it had under Legge's stewardship. Continuing as the New Philharmonia Orchestra, it reacquired the rights to the name  Philharmonia Orchestra  in 1977, and has been known by that name since.


Klemperer retired from conducting in 1971, but was officially still its principal conductor until his death in 1973. For those two intervening years, 















Lorin Maazel














 held the post of associate principal conductor (1971-1973), and was effectively the principal conductor. 












Riccardo Muti











 was principal conductor from 1973 to 1982.  







Giuseppe Sinopoli






 succeeded Muti, from 1984 to 1994. In 1997, 
Christoph von Dohnanyi became Principal Conductor, and served until 2008, at which time he took on the title of Honorary Conductor for Life of the orchestra.  In November 2006, the orchestra announced the appointment of 











Esa-Pekka Salonen










 as the orchestra's fifth Principal Conductor.2, effective with the 2008-2009 season.3  Salonen has often conducted the orchestra in concerts and records over a period of more than twenty years, and also served as principal guest conductor of the Philharmonia from 1985 to 1994.


The Philharmonia is one of the most recorded orchestras in the world, with over one thousand recordings. It has also been heard on the soundtracks of many films, performing the musical scores of such classics as 



Laurence Olivier


's 1944 film version of 
Shakespeare's 







Henry V






, and

Oliver Twist

Henry Barrowe (c. 1550   
April 6, 
1593), 



English


 
Puritan and 
Separatist, was born about 1550, in 

Norfolk
, of a family related by marriage to 
Nicholas Bacon, and probably to 










John Aylmer









, 








Bishop of London







. He matriculated at 




Clare Hall, Cambridge



, in November 1566, and graduated BA in 1569 1570. Afterwards he  followed the court  for some time, leading a frivolous if not licentious life. He was a member of 



Gray's Inn


 for a few years from 1576, but was never called to the bar.

In about 1580 or 1581 he was deeply impressed by a sermon, whereupon he retired to the country, and was led by study and meditation to the strictest form of 
Puritanism. Subsequently, in what manner is not known, he came into intimate relations with 






John Greenwood





, the 
Separatist leader, whose views he adopted without reserve. Though not strictly resident in 

London
 at this time, he was associated with  the brethren of the Separation  there, in whose secret meetings his natural earnestness and eloquence made him conspicuous.


Greenwood having been imprisoned in 











The Clink










, Barrowe came from the country to visit him, and on 
November 19 
1586 was detained by the gaoler and brought before Archbishop 

John Whitgift
. He insisted on the illegality of this arrest, refused either to take the ex officio oath or to give bail for future appearance, and was committed to the Gatehouse. After nearly six months detention and several irregular examinations before the high commissioners, he and Greenwood were formally indicted (May 1587) for 
recusancy under an act originally directed against Roman Catholics. They were ordered to find heavy bail for conformity, and to remain in the 








Fleet Prison







 until it was forthcoming. Barrowe continued a prisoner for the remainder of his life, nearly six years, sometimes in close confinement, sometimes having  the liberty of the prison.  He was subjected to several more examinations, once before the 
Privy Council at 








Whitehall







 on 
March 18 
1588, as a result of petition to 


the Queen

. On these occasions he vigorously maintained the principle of 
separatism, denouncing the prescribed ritual of the Church as  a false worship,  and the bishops as oppressors and persecutors.


During his imprisonments he was engaged in written controversy with 
Robert Browne (down to 1588), who had yielded a partial submission to the established order, and whom he therefore accounted a renegade. He also wrote several vigorous treatises in defence of separatism and 
congregational independency, the most important being:  



A True Description of the Visible Congregation of the Saints,  c. (1589)


A Plain Refutation of Mr Gifford s Booke, intituled A Short Treatise Gainst the Donatistes of England (1590 1591) 


A Brief Discovery of the False Church (1590).




Others were written in conjunction with his fellow-prisoner, Greenwood. These writings were taken charge of by friends and mostly printed in the 



Netherlands


. By 1590 the bishops thought it advisable to try other means of convincing or silencing these controversialists, and sent several conforming 
Puritan ministers to confer with them, but without effect. At length it was resolved to proceed on a capital charge of  devising and circulating seditious books,  for which, as the law then stood, it was easy to secure a conviction. They were tried and sentenced to death on 
23 March 
1593. The day after sentence they were brought out as if for execution and 
respited. On 
31 March they were taken to the gallows, and after the ropes had been placed about their necks were again respited. Finally they were 
hanged early on the morning of 
April 6. The motive of all this is obscure, but there is some evidence that the Lord Treasurer 

Burghley
 endeavoured to save their lives, and was frustrated by Whitgift and other bishops.

Cover of The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow by Anna Katharine Green



Anna Katharine Green (
November 11, 
1846   
April 11, 
1935) was an 








American







 
poet and 
novelist.  She was one of the first writers of 
detective fiction in America and distinguished herself by writing well plotted, legally accurate stories.


 Life and work 



Born in 

Brooklyn
, 





New York




, Green's early ambition was to write romantic verse, and she corresponded with 


Ralph Waldo Emerson

.  When her poetry failed to gain recognition, she produced her first and best known novel, The Leavenworth Case (1878).  She became a 
bestselling author, eventually publishing about 40 books.


Green was in some ways a progressive woman for her time succeeding in a 
genre dominated by male writers but she did not approve of many of her 
feminist contemporaries, and she was opposed to 
women's suffrage.  


Green married the 
actor, and later designer and artist, 

Charles Rohlfs
 on 
November 25, 
1884. Seven years her junior, Charles was made to give up acting by Anna's father before he could marry her. They had one daughter and two sons, 






Roland Rohlfs





 and 

Sterling Rohlfs
, who were test pilots. Green died in 

Buffalo, New York
, at the age of 88.

Instituto Nacional de Industria






SEAT, S.A. (

English pronunciation
: [ s  at],  say-at ; 

Spanish pronunciation
: [se at]) is a 



Spanish


 
automobile manufacturer founded in 
1950 by the 
Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI), with 
Fiat assistance, and now a wholly owned subsidiary of the 

German
 

Volkswagen Group
.  Its headquarters are at 

Martorell
 near 










Barcelona









, 



Spain


, and is legally inscribed in the official 
Mercantile Register of Barcelona, book 23662, folio 1, sheet B-56-855.


SEAT is an acronym for Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo, or in English Spanish Passenger Car Company.


Initially, SEAT manufactured rebadged 
Fiat models which differed very little visually from the products of the Italian parent. The SEAT Panda (later restyled as 

SEAT Marbella
) for example was based on the 

Fiat Panda
.  The 









SEAT 600








, based on 

Fiat 600
, was the first car for many Spanish families, and became a symbol of the 
Spanish Miracle.


The first car under the new SEAT logo without Fiat involvement appeared in 1982, and was called the 

SEAT Ronda
.  This was a restyled 

Fiat Ritmo
, and sparked a lawsuit from Fiat against SEAT, as the former claimed the car was still too similar to the Ritmo.  The then president of SEAT, 
Juan Miguel Antonanzas, showed a Ronda to the press with all the parts different from the Fiat Ritmo painted in bright yellow, to highlight the differences.  This ended the dispute.  Rumour at the time had it that Fiat was angry because the Ronda restyling was in fact too close to their own planned restyling for the Fiat Ritmo, which they had to scrap.


After the withdrawal of Fiat in 1981, the 

Volkswagen Group
 subsidiary 

Audi AG
 signed a cooperation agreement with SEAT, becoming the major 
shareholder in 1986, and 100% 
owner of the company in 1990.  During the mid 2000s, the ownership of the SEAT company was realigned, with Audi AG transferring ownership of SEAT to the top-tier 
holding company Volkswagen Group.



Facilities


SEAT has its manufacturing facilities in 

Martorell
, an industrial town close to 










Barcelona









. The plant was opened by 


King Juan Carlos of Spain

 in 1993, and replaced SEAT's original assembly plant by the coast in 
Barcelona's freeport zone.  The development facilities are some of the newest in the 

Volkswagen Group
.  For example, the development and design of the 

Audi Q7
 took place there.




Presence in different markets


The company styles its own models of cars in accordance with the development policies of the 

Volkswagen Group
.  Some of its cars have been sold outside 
Europe, badged as 

Volkswagen
s, such as the 

SEAT Ibiza
 hatchback, known in 

South Africa
 as the 









Volkswagen Polo Playa








, the 

SEAT Inca
 panel van as the 

Volkswagen Caddy
, or the 
SEAT Cordoba also known as the 
Volkswagen Polo Classic.


Rumours of a SEAT model being sold as a Volkswagen in 

Canada
 and the 








United States







 to supplement the Volkswagen's brand lineup there have occasionally circulated, but have always been unsubstantiated, and ultimately proven to be false. SEAT markets 6 models in 








Mexico







, and has dealer presence in 27 Mexican states.1


SEAT's presence in international markets (outside of Europe) has yet to be realised, with the failed plan to launch SEAT in Canada in 1994, and with the withdrawing of SEAT from the 

Australia
n market after only selling its range from 1995-1999. SEAT is also positioned to launch in the United States sometime after 2008, although this has yet to be verified as a certainty. SEAT currently continues to expand to international markets under the Volkswagen Group, particularly in the 



Middle East


 and 



Asia


. They have already achieved some success in 

Thailand
 and 

Israel
. After launching the brand in 

South Africa
 in June 2006   selling approximately 2600 vehicles, Volkswagen South Africa announced that it's pulling the Seat brand from the country by end 2008, citing that current and expected circumstances make the ongoing importation of a niche brand in the South African market non-viable.23




SEAT in motorsport


Since the Volkswagen Group takeover in 1990, SEAT has been increasing its presence in the motorsport world. This was mainly down to VW's plan on focusing the SEAT brand as 'sporty', to appeal to the younger generation of drivers.



Rallying


SEAT's first serious attempt at a 

World Rally Championship
 (WRC) title was burdened on the small 

SEAT Ibiza
, a 1.6L normally aspirated 
front-wheel drive car with its roots in the 

Volkswagen Polo
. The Ibiza allowed the company to start building its rallying experience, and was officially engaged in some European national championships. The years went by and little success followed until a 2L version of the Ibiza was 
homologated as a kit-car, and extra wide tracks, larger wheels, brakes, etc, were fitted to it as the 
Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) kit-car regulations allow. With these attributes, the car succeeded three times the 2L 
World Champion ('96, '97, '98), proving its maker had accumulated enough experience, and budgets, to take a chance at the reign category, the 
World Rally Car class of rallying cars.


SEATs three conquests of the 2L FIA title, and the sport's popularity in 



Spain


, probably convinced 

Volkswagen Group
 management to go further, and allocate sufficient budgets to the 
SEAT Sport department so as to allow it a chance to reach its goal. This situation came to an end in September 2000, when the company's, German upper management revoked its decision, and budgets, forcing SEAT Sport to retire from the World Rally Championship. The absence of convincing results must have obviously helped the management's decision.


SEATs project to build a WRC-spec car was officially announced during the 1997 San Remo rally.  It was in 1998 that the 
SEAT Cordoba WRC was first enrolled by the company to compete at the highest level of WRC racing. The Cordoba was based on the family saloon of the same name but was, naturally, a WRC class car. It had a 
4 cylinder 
turbocharged 
petrol engine, permanent 
four-wheel drive, and active differentials were involved in its transmission. However, the short 
wheelbase and high-mounted 
engine (compared to its rivals) worked against the Cordoba, and results weren't impressive. Despite hiring ex-WRC champion 
Didier Auriol, and a new 
evolution of the car, SEAT pulled out of international rallying at the end of 2000.




Touring cars





In 2003, SEAT announced a one-make championship for the new 
SEAT Leon Cupra R, the 
SEAT Cupra Challenge.


In 2004, SEAT with 






Ray Mallock Ltd.





 (RML) entered the 

British Touring Car Championship
, running two 

SEAT Toledo
 Cupra for former-BTCC Champion 




Jason Plato



, and 2003 Leon UK Champion, 




Rob Huff



.  In 2005, Huff left to join 

Chevrolet
 (run by RML in the 

World Touring Car Championship
 (WTCC), and he was replaced by 2004 Leon Champion 

James Pickford
, and 

Luke Hines
 as SEAT expanded to three cars, now run by 
Northern South. 2006 saw the Toledo replaced by the new 
Leon, and 




Darren Turner



 joined the team with 
James Thompson when his WTCC commitments allowed. 2007 was SEAT's best year in BTCC, as Plato was locked in a season-long battle with 




Fabrizio Giovanardi



, which came down to the final race of the season, but just missed out on the title.


Since 2005, SEAT has also competed in the 

World Touring Car Championship
, with its best season being 2007, where a failed 
water pump robbed 





Yvan Muller




 of certain victory at the final meeting in 

Macau
. SEAT utilised 

Audi
's pioneering 
diesel engine technology (from the 







Audi R10 TDI






 









LMP1








) in touring cars, when they became the first team to run a 
TDI in the WTCC. SEAT's UK team followed suit in the 2008 BTCC.  The team is also now to be sponsored by 







Holiday Inn






 in the BTCC.


On the 11th September 2008 SEAT UK announced that it was to withdraw from all motor sport activity in the UK at the end of the season. The SEAT Cupra Championship and the SEAT BTCC campaign are to end at Brands Hatch on the 21st September. BTCC drivers Jason Plato and Darren Turner have been left without drives for 2009 however Plato is hopeful of continuing in Touring Cars whilst Turner may look to expand his sportscar commitments.





Popular culture






Lara Croft

 has been used to advertise for SEAT, where she changes vehicles in the way she changed items.  The cars were a yellow 
SEAT Cordoba Vario with matching 
Jet ski (to escape from a 
Tyrannosaurus rex, a green 

SEAT Arosa
 (to escape armed bikers), a red 

SEAT Ibiza Mk 1
 (to jump a destroyed bridge), and an aqua 

SEAT Alhambra
 (to pick up six hitch-hiking surfers).

(June 2008)''




According to interviews with the author, the style for InuYasha's clothing was based on  priest's garb  of Japan's  Warring States  period.


InuYasha speaks with harsh 

Japanese
. He never uses 
honorifics and when talking to those he does not like he uses  temee  and  kisama , both of which are considered very rude. He uses the tough masculine pronoun  ore . He also does not show respect to his elders, often calling them  -baba  or  -jiji , which translates as  old hag  or  old geezer , respectively.




Character Outline



Personality


InuYasha is a brave but 
naive 
Hany , a half-demon, the result of a powerful dog demon and a human woman. He maintains a crass, rude attitude towards everyone except Kikyo and sometimes to Kagome, and to a lesser degree the rest of his companions except Shippo. One of InuYasha's prominent character traits is his tendency to allow his anger to cloud his judgment and cause him to act rashly, often resulting in violence. InuYasha is offended when someone suggests that he is inferior to 
y kai due to his human parentage.


Orphaned at a young age, InuYasha was rejected by humans because of his 
y kai side and looked down upon by y kai because his human blood supposedly taints his superior y kai blood; thus, he found it hard to trust anyone. The Jewel of Four Souls or Shikion Jewel was a powerful object, capable of turning InuYasha into a full y kai, and InuYasha set out to find it, though instead fell in love with the human protector, Kikyo. However, through a course of events, Kikyo was tricked into pinning InuYasha with an arrow to a tree. When awoken by Kagome over 50 years later, InuYasha is unruly and uncivil after feeling betrayed by his loved one. As time progressed, InuYasha becomes more civil, losing some of his more childish qualities and valueing his friendships. In the manga they completed the Shikion Jewel and Kagome decided to live with him and in the end they fell in love. But in the anime they didn't complete the Shikion Jewel and they didn't defeat Naraku but it seemed that he and Kagome started to fall for each other.




Abilities


InuYasha has both physical and sword techniques and abilities. He has 
superhuman strength, speed, stamina, defense, healing, and senses, particularly hearing and smelling. Being part y kai, he also has the abiltiy to channel his y kai energy into his claws into an attack named Iron Reaver Soul Stealer and, when combined with InuYasha's blood, is called Blades of Blood. InuYasha also carries the sword Tetsusaiga (   , Tessaiga, Iron Crushing Fang), which enables him to use such moves as Kenatsu, the ability to cut an enemy without physical contact, Wind Scar, a special attack accomplished by finding the fissure or scar between colliding demonic winds of Tetsusaiga's wielder and the opposing demon, and Backlash Wave, which creates large twisters that redirects the enemies attack while adding a Wind Scar to it. Tetsusaiga is also capable of the technique Adamant Barrage, which occurs when Tetsusiga's blade turns to fragmented diamonds and, when whipped, shoots out many shards. It can also use Meid  Zangetsuha, which creates a path to Hell. With Kagome, InuYasha was able to use the Sacred Backlash Wave, which consists of Kagome firing a Sacred Arrow into InuYasha's Backlash Wave. Given directly from an orb of a bat demon, InuYasha was able to use the Barrier Breaker which renders most barriers useless.


Being a half-demon, InuYasha loses his demonic powers periodically and is turned into a normal human with black hair. For him, it occurs during the first night of a 
new moon. His team members try their best to protect him at that time, and keep his vulnerability secret from others. Despite their efforts, however, some of InuYasha's adversaries, including 

Kagura
, learn of this weakness. InuYasha may be controlled by The Beads of Subjugation (     , Kotodama no Nenju), a necklace that Kagome can command, often by using the word  sit  which causes the beads to yank downward.





Plot Overview


InuYasha, having been pinned to a tree by his former love, Kikyo, is awakened by the teenage girl, Kagome. While at first his only desire is to retrieve The Jewel of Fours Souls so he can become a full y kai instead of a half-demon, InuYasha eventually creates a friendship with Kagome and the rest of their group. Though on uneven terms with his half-brother Sesshomaru, InuYasha had a close relationship with his mother and, though he had never met him, his father did leave him a sword, Tetsusaiga. When the half-demon Naraku begins collecting jewel shards to gain ultimate power, InuYasha and his group set out to collect the shards first and defeat Naraku.

Cezzar Ahmet Pasha (1708-1804), born in Stolac in Bosnia and Herzegovina, also identified in transliterations from Arabic as Djezzar Pasha, was an 

Ottoman
 governor who defended Acre successfully when 


Napoleon Bonaparte

 

besieged
 it during his 
campaign in Syria. Djezzar, which translates as Butcher, was known for his brutal techniques when handling enemies.

After the capture of Egypt (which was then an Ottoman territory) in 1798 by Bonaparte, the French army attempted to invade Syria. Although the French successfully captured 
El Arish and 
Jaffa, and won every battle they fought against the Ottomans on an open field, they were unable to breach the fortifications of Acre. Their army was weakened by disease and cut off from resupply.  Bonaparte, whose fleet had been destroyed by 
Nelson at the 

Battle of the Nile
, was forced to return with his army to 

Cairo
.


Ahmet died in 1804 of an unknown disease.

 ( 


info


) (Alta or formerly Alaheadju in 

Northern Sami
, Alattio or Alta in 

Finnish
/

Kven
) is a municipality and town in the county of 







Finnmark






, 



Norway


. 

Alta was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 (see 
formannskapsdistrikt). 







Talvik






 was separated from Alta January 1, 1863 - but again merged with Alta January 1, 1964.



The name


The municipality is probably named after the fjord (
Altafjorden).


Until 1918 the name was written Alten.




Coat-of-arms


The coat-of-arms is from modern times (1976). It shows the head of an arrow. (Similar heads made of 
quartz, from the Old Stone Age, are found in the municipality.)




 Geography 





The municipality covers 3,845 km , in the west of the county, mostly situated along the 
Altafjord, taking in large tracts of woodlands, as well as parts of the High Plateau of 
Finnmarksvidda. The river 



Altaelva


 has carved out one of the largest 
canyons in Europe on its way from the plateau down to the 
fjord. Most people live in the town of Alta, stretching along the inner part of the fjord, enjoying a sheltered climate; daytime summer temperatures are often comparable to southern parts of Norway, and lowland areas in Alta are mostly sheltered from the winter 
storms. Precipitation is low, with a yearly average precipitation of only 400 mm. The clear skies are the reason why Alta early was chosen as an excellent location for studying the 
aurora borealis.




 History 





Altafjord is sheltered by mountains






Rock carvings at Alta.





The 

Rock carvings at Alta
, dating from circa 
4200 BC to 
500 BC, are on the 


UNESCO

 list of 







World Heritage Site






s. 
In addition, the 
Komsa culture was named after the Komsa mountain in Alta municipality, where the first 
archeological remains of this culture were discovered.


In 







World War II






, the 











German battleship Tirpitz










 used Altafjord as a harbor, and was damaged here by attacking 
allied warplanes.












Altasaken








 in 1979 made headlines for weeks, as many people (especially 

Sami people
 and 
environmentalists) demonstrated and used civil disobedience to prevent the building of a 
dam in order to produce 
hydropower. The dam was built, however, and the river still offers good 
salmon fishing.


Alta became a city (town) in 1999. The population has been growing steadily for many years.




 Birdlife 





City centre in Alta






Langfjorden, Alta



For those interested in bird watching, the river outlet, known locally as Altaosen is well worth a visit. This tidal area is used as a stopover for many wetland species.




 Communications and Economy 


Alta is a communication center in Finnmark. 

Alta Airport
 served 308,000 passengers in 2004. There are direct flights to 


















Oslo

















. Alta also has 
port facilities in the town center, and the 



E6


 passes through Alta. 


Main activities in Alta include trading, small industry, education and public service. The town is also famous for its 
slate industry. Finnmark University College (Hogskolen i Finnmark) is situated in Alta, and there is also a research institution (Norut NIBR Finnmark). The town has the most northern 








Ice hotel







 in Europe and the most northern 

Subway
 restaurant in the world.
