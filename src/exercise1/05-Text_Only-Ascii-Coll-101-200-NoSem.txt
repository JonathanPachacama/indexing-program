The Persian Gulf War or  Gulf War (also known as the mother of all battles (Um Al M 'arik) Ar:            in Iraq)  (2 August 1990   28 February 1991)12 was a conflict between 

Iraq
 and a 
coalition force from 34 nations3 authorized by the 
United Nations (UN) but led primarily by the 








United States







 and the 











United Kingdom










 in order to return 

Kuwait
 to the control of the 









Emir of Kuwait








. The conflict developed in the context of the 
Iran Iraq War and in 1990 Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing Iraq's oil through 
slant drilling.4 The invasion of Kuwait by 
Iraqi troops was met with immediate 
economic sanctions against Iraq by some members of the 
UN Security Council, and with immediate preparation for war by the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The expulsion of Iraqi troops from Kuwait began in January 1991 and was a decisive victory for the coalition forces, which took over Kuwait and entered Iraqi territory. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and bordering areas of 

Saudi Arabia
. Iraq also launched 
missiles against targets in Saudi Arabia and 

Israel
 in retaliation for their support of the invading forces in Kuwait.


Since the 
Iran Iraq War of 1980 88 had been called the  Persian Gulf War  by many news sources, the 1991 war has sometimes been called the  Second Persian Gulf War , but more commonly, the 1991 war is styled simply the  Gulf War  or the  First Gulf War , in distinction from the 

2003 invasion of Iraq
.5  Operation Desert Storm  was the U.S. name of the 


air and land operations

 and is often incorrectly used to refer to the entire conflict. Each nation participating had its own operation name for its contibution - US Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; UK Operation Granby; Canada Operation Friction etc. 


Shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, 
U.S. President 
George H.W. Bush started to deploy 









U.S. Army








, 






Navy





, 







Marine Corps






, 










Air Force









, and 










Coast Guard









 units to Saudi Arabia (Operation Desert Shield), while at the same time urging other countries to send their own forces to the scene. UN coalition-building efforts were so successful that by the time the fighting (Operation Desert Storm) began on January 16, 1991, twelve countries had sent naval forces, joining the regional states of Saudi Arabia and the 

Persian Gulf
 states, as well as the huge array of the U.S. Navy, which deployed six 
aircraft-carrier 
battle groups; eight countries had sent ground forces, joining the regional troops of 

Bahrain
, Kuwait, 

Oman
, 

Qatar
, Saudi Arabia, and the 

United Arab Emirates
, as well as the seventeen heavy and six light brigades of the U.S. Army and nine Marine regiments, with their large support and service forces; and four countries had sent 
combat aircraft, joining the local air forces of Kuwait, 

Qatar
, and Saudi Arabia, as well as the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and 
U.S. Marine aviation, for a grand total of 2,430 fixed-wing aircraft.


Against them, the Iraqis had only a few 
gunboats and small missile craft to match the coalition's 
armada; but on the other hand, some 1.2 million ground troops with about 5,800 
tanks, 5,100 other 
armoured vehicles, and 3,850 
artillery pieces made for greater strength on the ground. Iraq also had 750 fighters and bombers, 200 other aircraft, and elaborate missile and gun defenses.



Origins





Further information: 
Iraq-United States relations

During the Cold War, Iraq had been chiefly an ally of the 



Soviet Union


 and there was a history of friction between it and the United States. The U.S. was concerned with Iraq s role in 

Israel
i 
Palestinian politics and its disapproval of moves toward peace between Israel and 

Egypt
. The U.S. also disliked Iraqi support for various 

Arab
 and 
Palestinian militant groups such as 

Abu Nidal
, which led to its inclusion on the incipient 
U.S. list of state sponsors of international terrorism on 29 December 1979. The U.S. remained officially neutral during the outbreak of hostilities in the 
Iran Iraq War, although it assisted Iraq covertly. In March 1982, however, Iran began a successful 
counteroffensive (

Operation Undeniable Victory
) and the United States began to more concertedly support Iraq to prevent Iran from overrunning the region.


In a bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the list of 
state sponsors of terrorism. Ostensibly this was because of improvement in the regime s record, although former United States Assistant Secretary of Defense 
Noel Koch later stated,  No one had any doubts about [the Iraqis'] continued involvement in 
terrorism... The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran. 6 With Iran's newfound success in the war and its rebuff of a peace offer in July, 
arms sales to Iraq (which included 
poison gas which was then used against Iranian troops) from other states (most importantly the 
USSR, 

France
, Egypt, and starting that year, the 

People's Republic of China
) reached a record spike in 1982, but an obstacle remained to any potential U.S.-Iraqi relationship   Abu Nidal continued to operate with official support in 

Baghdad
. When Saddam Hussein expelled the group to 

Syria
 at the U.S.' request in November 1983, the Reagan administration then sent 


Donald Rumsfeld

 to Saddam Hussein as a special envoy to cultivate ties.



Tensions with Kuwait





Main article: 

Invasion of Kuwait



Kuwait had been part of the Ottoman 
province of Basra, and although its ruling dynasty, the 
al-Sabah family, had concluded a protectorate agreement in 1899 that assigned responsibility for its foreign affairs to Britain, it did not make any attempt to secede from the 

Ottoman Empire
. For this reason, Iraqi governments had always refused to accept Kuwait's separation, and its borders were never clearly defined or mutually agreed. The British High Commissioner drew lines that deliberately constricted Iraq's access to the ocean so that any future Iraqi government would be in no position to threaten Britain's domination of the Persian Gulf.


In late July 1990, as negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait stalled, Iraq massed troops on its border with the 
emirate and summoned U.S. 
ambassador 

April Glaspie
 to a meeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Two transcripts of that meeting have been produced, both of them controversial. In them, Saddam Hussein outlined his grievances against Kuwait, while promising that he would not invade Kuwait before one more round of negotiations. In the version published by 

The New York Times
 on September 23, 1990, Glaspie expressed concern over the troop buildup to Saddam Hussein:



We have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. I was in the American Embassy in Kuwait during the late  60s. The instruction we had during this period was that we should express no opinion on this issue and that the issue is not associated with America. 

James Baker
 has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction. We hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via (





Chedli Klibi




, then 

Arab League
 General Secretary) or via 


President Mubarak

. All that we hope is that these issues are solved quickly. With regard to all of this, can I ask you to see how the issue appears to us?
My assessment after 25 years' service in this area is that your objective must have strong backing from your Arab brothers. I now speak of 
oil. But you, Mr. President, have fought through a horrific and painful war. Frankly, we can see only that you have deployed massive troops in the south. Normally that would not be any of our business. But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned. And for this reason, I received an instruction to ask you, in the spirit of friendship   not in the spirit of confrontation   regarding your intentions.
I simply describe the position of my Government. And I do not mean that the situation is a simple situation. But our concern is a simple one.



Some have interpreted portions of these statements, particularly the language  We have no opinion on the Arab Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait , as signaling an American  green light  for the invasion. Although the 
U.S. State Department did not confirm (or deny) the authenticity of these transcripts, U.S. sources say that it handled everything  by the book  (in accordance with the U.S.' official neutrality on the Iraq Kuwait issue) and had not signaled to Saddam Hussein any approval for defying the Arab League s 

Jeddah
 crisis squad, which had conducted the negotiations. Many believe that Saddam Hussein may have been influenced by the perception that the U.S. was not interested in the issue, (as they had not minded when he ordered the invasion of Iran) for which the Glaspie transcript is merely an example, and that he may have felt so in part because of U.S. support for the 
reunification of Germany, another act that he considered to be nothing more than the nullification of an artificial, internal border. Others, such as 










Kenneth Pollack









, believe he had no such illusion, or that he simply underestimated the extent of a U.S. response.


In November 1989, 
CIA director 
William Webster met with the Kuwaiti head of security, Brigadier 
Fahd Ahmed Al-Fahd. Subsequent to Iraq s invasion of Kuwait, Iraq claimed to have found a memorandum pertaining to their conversation. 

The Washington Post
 reported that Kuwait s foreign minister fainted when confronted with this document at an Arab summit in August. Later, Iraq cited this memorandum as evidence of a CIA   Kuwaiti plot to destabilize Iraq economically and politically. The CIA and Kuwait have described the meeting as routine and the memorandum as a forgery. The purported document reads in part:



We agreed with the American side that it was important to take advantage of the deteriorating economic situation in Iraq in order to put pressure on that country's government to delineate our common border. The Central Intelligence Agency gave us its view of appropriate means of pressure, saying that broad cooperation should be initiated between us on condition that such activities be coordinated at a high level.







On 23 August 1990 Saddam Hussein appeared on state television with Western hostages to whom he had refused exit visas. They were seen as 
human shields, though Saddam Hussein denied the claim. In the video he is seen ruffling the hair of a young boy named Stuart Lockwood and asks through the interpreter if he is  getting his milk . He went on to say  We hope your presence as guests here will not be for too long. Your presence here, and in other places, is meant to prevent the scourge of war. 7





Diplomacy and Operation Desert Shield



UN resolution


On August 2, 1990 Saddam launched the 
invasion of Kuwait. After two days of intense combat, most of the 

Kuwaiti Armed Forces
 were either overrun by the 



Iraqi Republican Guard


 or escaped to neighboring 

Saudi Arabia
. Within hours of the invasion, Kuwaiti and U.S. delegations requested a meeting of the UN Security Council, which passed 




Resolution 660



, condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal of Iraqi troops. On August 3, the Arab League passed its own resolution. The resolution called for a solution to the conflict from within the League, and warned against foreign intervention. On August 6, 
UN Resolution 661 placed economic sanctions on Iraq.




Possible attack on Saudi Arabia


The decision by the U.S. and its allies to fight the Iraqi invasion had as much to do with preventing an attack on Saudi Arabia, a nation of considerable importance owing to its oil reserves, as it did with liberating Kuwait itself. The rapid success of the Iraqi army had brought it within easy striking distance of the 
Hama oil fields, one of Saudi Arabia s largest. Iraqi control of these fields as well as Kuwait and Iraqi reserves would have given it control of the majority of the world's reserves. The Iraqi armoured divisions would have encountered the same difficulties that Saudi forces faced defending the oil fields, namely traversing large distances across inhospitable desert. This would have been exacerbated by intense bombing by the 
Saudi Air Force, by far the most well-equipped (if not so well-trained) arm of the Saudi military.


Iraq had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis had lent Saddam Hussein some 26 billion dollars to prosecute his invasion of Iran, as they feared the influence of mainly 
Shia Iran's 
Islamic revolution on its own Shia minority (most of the Saudi oil fields are in territory populated by Shias). The long 
desert border was also ill-defined. Soon after his conquest of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein began verbally attacking the Saudi 
kingdom. He argued that the U.S.-supported Saudi state was an illegitimate guardian of the holy cities of 
Mecca and 
Medina. Saddam Hussein combined the language of the 
Islamist groups that had recently fought in 

Afghanistan
 with the rhetoric Iran had long used to attack the Saudis.




Operation Desert Shield



Acting on the policy of the 


Carter Doctrine

, and out of fear the Iraqi army could launch an invasion of Saudi Arabia, U.S. President George H. W. Bush quickly announced that the U.S. would launch a  wholly defensive  mission to prevent Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia   Operation Desert Shield was when U.S. troops were moved into Saudi Arabia on August 7, 1990 (or August 8 depending on time zone used).8 This  wholly defensive  doctrine was to be quickly abandoned. On August 8, Iraq declared parts of Kuwait to be extensions of the Iraqi province of 

Basra
 and the rest to be the 19th province of Iraq.9


The 






United States Navy





 mobilised two naval battle groups, the 
aircraft carriers 










USS Dwight D. Eisenhower''









 and 



USS Independence''


 and their escorts, to the area, where they were ready by August 8. A total of 48 U.S. Air Force F-15s from the 

1st Fighter Wing
 at 

Langley Air Force Base
, Virginia, landed in Saudi Arabia and immediately commenced round the clock air patrols of the Saudi Kuwait Iraq border areas to prevent further Iraqi advances. The U.S. also sent the battleships 










USS Missouri''









 and 













USS Wisconsin''












 to the region. Military buildup continued from there, eventually reaching 543,000 troops, twice the number used in the 

2003 invasion of Iraq
. Much of the material was airlifted or carried to the staging areas via 







fast sealift ships






, allowing a quick buildup.




Building a coalition


A long 
series of UN Security Council resolutions and Arab League resolutions were passed regarding the conflict. One of the most important was 
Resolution 678, passed on November 29, giving Iraq a withdrawal deadline of January 15, 1991, and authorizing  all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660,  a diplomatic formulation authorizing the use of force.


The United States, especially 






Secretary of State





 

James Baker
, assembled a coalition of forces to join it in opposing Iraq, consisting of forces from 34 countries: 

Afghanistan
, 


Argentina

, 

Australia
, 

Bahrain
, 

Bangladesh
, 

Belgium
, 

Canada
,

Singapore

Spain


, 

Syria
, the 

United Arab Emirates
, the 











United Kingdom










 and the 








United States







 itself.10 Although they did not contribute any forces, 
Japan and 

West Germany
 did make financial contributions totaling $10 billion and $6.6 billion respectively. U.S. troops represented 73% of the coalition s 956,600 troops in Iraq. Many of the coalition forces were reluctant to join; some felt that the war was an internal Arab affair, or feared increasing American influence in Kuwait. In the end, many nations were persuaded by Iraq s belligerence towards other Arab states, and offers of economic aid or debt forgiveness. 









Reasons for intervention


The United States and the United Nations gave several public justifications for involvement in the conflict. The most prominent reason was the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity. In addition, the United States moved to support its ally of Saudi Arabia, whose importance in the region and as a key supplier of oil made it of considerable 
geopolitical importance. During a speech given on September 11, 1990, U.S. President George H.W. Bush summed up the reasons with the following remarks:  Within three days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia. It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression. 11 The Pentagon claimed that satellite photos showing a buildup of Iraqi forces along the border were the source of this information, but this was later shown to be false when a reporter for the Saint Petersburg Times acquired commercial satellite images made at the time in question, which showed nothing but empty desert.12


Polls showed that upwards of 80% of the American public supported the troop deployment.13 The anti-war movement and its  No Blood For Oil  slogan did not achieve the levels of support it would get 12 years later.


Other justifications for foreign involvement included Iraq s history of 
human rights abuses under Saddam Hussein. Iraq was also known to possess 
biological weapons and 
chemical weapons, which Hussein had used against Iranian troops during the 
Iran Iraq War and against his own county's 

Kurdish
 population in the 

Al-Anfal Campaign
. Iraq was known to have a 
nuclear weapons program as well.


Although there were human rights abuses committed in Kuwait by the invading Iraqi military, the ones best known in the U.S. were an invention of the public relations firm hired by the government of Kuwait to influence U.S. opinion in favor of military intervention. Shortly after Iraq s invasion of Kuwait, the organisation 


Citizens for a Free Kuwait

 was formed in the U.S. It hired the 
public relations firm 


Hill   Knowlton

 for about $11 million, paid by the 
Kuwaiti government.14 Among many other means of influencing U.S. opinion (distributing books on Iraqi atrocities to U.S. soldiers deployed in the region, 'Free Kuwait' T-shirts and speakers to college campuses, and dozens of video news releases to television stations), the firm arranged for an appearance before a group of members of Congress in which a woman identifying herself as a 









nurse working in the Kuwait City hospital








 described Iraqi soldiers pulling babies out of incubators and letting them die on the floor. The story was an influence in tipping both the public and Congress towards a war with Iraq: six Congressmen said the testimony was enough for them to support military action against Iraq and seven Senators referenced the testimony in debate. The Senate supported the military actions in a 52-47 vote. A year after the war, however, this allegation was revealed to be a fabrication. The woman who had testified was found to be a member of the 

Kuwaiti Royal Family
, in fact the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S. 15 She had not been living in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion. The details of the Hill   Knowlton public relations campaign, including the incubator testimony, were published in a John R. MacArthur's Second Front: Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War (Berkeley, CA: University of CA Press, 1992), and came to wide public attention when an op-ed by MacArthur was published in the New York Times. This prompted a re-examination by 
Amnesty International, which had originally promoted an account alleging even greater numbers of babies torn from incubators than the original fake testimony; after finding no evidence to support it, the organisation issued a retraction.




Final peace proposals


Various peace proposals were floated, but none were agreed to. The United States insisted that the only acceptable terms for peace were Iraq's full, unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. Iraq insisted that withdrawal from Kuwait would have to be  linked  to a simultaneous adherence by neighbouring countries to similar UN resolutions, which would necessitate the withdrawal of Syrian troops from 

Lebanon
 and 
Israeli troops from the 
West Bank, 

Gaza Strip
, the 

Golan Heights
, and southern Lebanon. 
Morocco and 

Jordan
 were persuaded by this proposal, but 

Syria
, 

Israel
, and the anti-Iraq coalition denied that there was any connection to the Kuwait issue, despite the UN resolutions. Syria joined the coalition to expel Saddam Hussein but Israel remained officially neutral despite rocket attacks on Israeli civilians. The U.S. made a concerted effort to prevent Israel from getting involved so as not to inflame Arab countries. The Bush administration persuaded Israel to remain confident that the 

Special Air Service
 were working behind enemy-lines in Iraq in search of SCUD missile launchers that were being targeted towards Israeli cities.


On January 12, 1991 the 

United States Congress
 authorized the use of military force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. The votes were 52-47 in the 
U.S. Senate and 250-183 in the 
U.S. House of Representatives. These were the closest margins in authorizing force by the Congress since the 

War of 1812
. Soon after, the other states in the coalition also followed suit.





Air campaign





See also: 








Operation Instant Thunder










The Persian Gulf War started with an extensive 








aerial bombing







 campaign. The coalition flew over 100,000 
sorties, dropping 88,500 tons of bombs,16 and widely destroying military and civilian infrastructure.17



Main air campaign starts





A day after the deadline set in Resolution, the coalition launched a massive air campaign codenamed Operation Desert Storm with more than 1,000 
sorties launching per day. It all began on January 17, 1991, when eight U.S. 

AH-64 Apache
 helicopters, and two 

MH-53 Pave Low
 helicopters destroyed Iraqi radar sites near the Iraqi-Saudi Arabian border at 2:38 A.M. Baghdad time, which could have warned Iraq of an upcoming attack. At 2:43 A.M. two 
EF-111 Ravens with terrain following radar led 22 

F-15E Strike Eagle
s against H-2 and H-3 - airfields in Western Iraq. Minutes later one of the EF-111 crews   Captain James Denton and Captain 










Brent Brandon









   destroyed an Iraqi 

Dassault Mirage F-1
, when their low altitude maneuvering led the F-1 into the ground.


At 3 A.M., ten U.S. 

F-117 Nighthawk
 Stealth Fighters under the protection of a three-ship formation of EF-111s bombed 

Baghdad
, the capital.


Within hours of the start of the coalition air campaign, a 

P-3 Orion
 called  Outlaw Hunter  developed by the Navy s 
Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, which was testing a highly specialised 
OTH-T (over the horizon targeting system package), detected a large number of Iraqi patrol boats and naval vessels attempting to make a run from Basra and 
Um Qasar to Iranian waters.  Outlaw Hunter  vectored in strike elements which attacked the flotilla near 





Bubiyan Island




 destroying 11 vessels and damaging scores more.


Concurrently, U.S. Navy 

BGM-109 Tomahawk
 Cruise Missiles struck targets in Baghdad, and other coalition aircraft struck targets throughout Iraq. Government buildings, TV stations, 

Iraqi Air Force
 fields and presidential palaces were destroyed. Five hours after the first attacks, Baghdad state radio broadcast a voice identified as Saddam Hussein declaring that  The great duel, the mother of all battles has begun. The dawn of victory nears as this great showdown begins. 


The Persian Gulf War is sometimes called the  computer war  because of the advanced weapons used in the air campaign which included 
precision-guided munitions (or  smart bombs ) and 
cruise missiles, although these were very much in the minority when compared with  dumb bombs . 
Cluster munitions and 








BLU-82  Daisy Cutters 







 were also used. Iraq responded by launching eight 

Iraqi modified Scud
 missiles into Israel the next day. These missile attacks on Israel were to continue throughout the six weeks of the war. The first priority for Coalition forces was 
destruction of the Iraqi air force and anti-aircraft facilities. 
EA-6Bs, EF-111 
radar jammers and F-117A 
stealth planes were heavily used in this phase to elude Iraq s extensive 
SAM systems and anti-aircraft weapons. The sorties were launched mostly from Saudi Arabia and the six Coalition 
aircraft carrier battle groups (
CVBG) in the Persian Gulf and 
Red Sea. Persian Gulf CVBGs included 
USS Midway'', 



USS John F. Kennedy''


 and 



USS Ranger''


. 



USS America''


, 










USS Theodore Roosevelt''









, and 



USS Saratoga''


 operated from the Red Sea (USS America transitioned to the Persian Gulf midway through the air war).


Iraqi antiaircraft defenses, including shoulder-launched ground-to-air missiles, were surprisingly effective against coalition aircraft and the coalition suffered 75 aircraft losses.18 In particular, RAF and U.S. Navy aircraft which flew at low altitudes to avoid radar were particularly badly hit, since Iraqi defenses relied very little on radar, and to a large extent on small scale weapons which were well targeted against low-flying aircraft.19


The next coalition targets were command and communication facilities. Saddam Hussein had closely micromanaged the Iraqi forces in the Iran Iraq War and initiative at the lower levels was discouraged. Coalition planners hoped Iraqi resistance would quickly collapse if deprived of command and control.

Iraq's air force escapes to Iran





F-14 Tomcats from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf await their turn refuelling from a KC-10A over Iraq during Desert Storm while conducting a MIGCAP mission to stop fleeing Iraqi fighters.





The first week of the air war saw a few Iraqi sorties; but these did little damage, and 38 Iraqi 
MiGs were shot down by Coalition planes. Soon after, the Iraqi Air Force began fleeing to Iran, with 115 to 140 aircraft flown to Iran.20 The mass exodus of Iraqi aircraft to Iran took coalition forces by surprise as the Coalition had been expecting the aircraft to flee to 

Jordan
, a nation friendly to Iraq rather than Iran, Iraq's long-time enemy. The Coalition had placed aircraft over Western Iraq to try and stop such a retreat into Jordan. This meant they were unable to react before most of the Iraqi aircraft had made it  safely  to Iranian airbases. The coalition eventually established a virtual  wall  of F-15 Eagle and F-14 Tomcat fighters on the Iraq border with Iran (called MIGCAP) thereby stopping the exodus of fleeing Iraqi fighters. Iran has never returned the aircraft to Iraq and did not release the aircrews home until years later. However, most Iraqi planes remained in Iraq. They were devastated by Coalition aircraft throughout the war.




Infrastructure bombing


The third and largest phase of the air campaign ostensibly targeted military targets throughout Iraq and Kuwait: 
Scud missile launchers, 
weapons of mass destruction sites, weapons research facilities and naval forces. About one-third of the Coalition airpower was devoted to attacking Scuds, which were on trucks and therefore difficult to locate. Some U.S. and British 
special forces teams had been covertly inserted into western Iraq to aid in the search and destruction of Scuds. However, the lack of adequate terrain for concealment hindered their operations, and many of them were killed or captured   such as the famous 
Bravo Two Zero patrol of the SAS. Iraqi fighters tried to stop these attacks, but they suffered many losses. 



Civilian infrastructure


Allied bombing raids were successful in destroying Iraqi civilian infrastructure. 11 of Iraq's 20 major power stations and 119 substations were totally destroyed, while a further six major power stations were damaged.2122 At the end of the war, electricity production was at four percent of its pre-war levels. Bombs destroyed the utility of all major 
dams, most major pumping stations and many 
sewage treatment plants, turning Iraq from one of the most advanced Arab countries into one of the most backward. 
Telecommunications equipment, port facilities, oil refineries and distribution, railroads and bridges were also destroyed.





The Iraqi targets were located by 
aerial photography and were referenced to the 
GPS coordinates of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which were determined by a 
USAF officer in August 1990: he arrived at the airport carrying a briefcase with a GPS receiver in it, then an embassy car took him to the embassy. He walked to the embassy courtyard, opened the briefcase, took one GPS reading, and put the machine back in the case. Then he returned to the U.S. gave the GPS receiver to the appropriate intelligence agency in 
Langley, 

Virginia
, where the position of the U.S. Embassy was officially determined. This position served as the origin for a coordinate system used to designate targets in Baghdad. 23


Jordan's neutrality in the war prompted U.S. fighter jets to bomb highways connecting Iraq and Jordan, crippling infrastructure on both sides.





Civilian casualties



The Iraqi government reported the high rate of Iraqi civilian casualties to gain support throughout the 
Muslim world. The U.S. claimed the Iraqi government fabricated numerous attacks on Iraqi holy sites in order to rally the Muslim community. One such instance had Iraqis reporting that coalition forces attacked the holy cities of 

Najaf
 and 

Karbala
. The final number of Iraqi civilians killed was 2,278, while 5,965 were reported wounded.24 Almost all of these casualties were from U.S. bombing and missile raids. 


On February 13, 1991, two laser-guided 
smart bombs destroyed the 
Amiriyah 
blockhouse, which was a civilian air shelter, killing hundreds of civilians. U.S. officials claimed that the blockhouse was also a military communications centre, a claim that has never been verified.




Iraq launches missile strikes



If Iraq was to be forced to obey UN resolutions, the Iraqi government made it no secret that it would respond by attacking Israel, who was allowed to ignore them without any action from the UN. Before the war started, 

Tariq Aziz
, Iraqi Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, was asked,  if war starts...will you attack Israel?  His response was,  Yes, absolutely, yes. 25 The Iraqis hoped that attacking Israel would draw them into the war. It was expected that this would then lead to the withdrawal of the U.S.' Arab allies, who would be reluctant to fight alongside the Jewish State. Israel did not join the coalition, and all Arab states stayed in the coalition. The Scud missiles generally caused fairly light damage, although their potency was felt on February 25 when 28 U.S. soldiers were killed when a Scud destroyed their barracks in 

Dhahran
. The Scuds targeting Israel were ineffective due to the fact that increasing the range of the Scud resulted in the dramatic reduction in accuracy and payload. Nevertheless, the total of 39 missiles that landed on Israel caused extensive property damage and two direct deaths, and caused the United States to deploy two 
















Patriot missile















 battalions in Israel, and the Netherlands to send one Patriot Squadron in an attempt to deflect the attacks. Allied air forces were also extensively exercised in  Scud hunts  in the Iraqi desert, trying to locate the camouflaged trucks before they fired their missiles at Israel or Saudi Arabia. Three SCUDs missiles, along with an Allied Patriot that malfunctioned, hit 










Ramat Gan









 in Israel on January 22, 1991, injuring 96 people, and indirectly causing the deaths of three elderly people who died of 
heart attacks. The Israeli policy for the previous forty years had been retaliation, but at the urging of the U.S. and theater commanders, they decided that discretion was the better part of valour in this instance. After initial hits by SCUD missiles, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir hesitantly refused any retaliating measures against Saddam Hussein, due to increasing pressure from the United States to remain out of the conflict.26 The U.S. was concerned that any Israeli action would escalate the conflict simply by its occurring, and an air strike by the IAF would have required overflying hostile Jordan or Syria, which could have provoked them to enter the war in Iraq or to attack Israel.




Vulnerability of Iraq against air power

On January 29, Iraq attacked and occupied the lightly-defended Saudi city of 








Khafji







 with tanks and infantry. However, the 

Battle of Khafji
 ended when Iraqis were driven back by Saudi and 
Qatari forces supported by 







U.S. Marines






 with 
close air support over the following two days. Khafji was a strategic city immediately after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The Iraqi reluctance to commit several armoured divisions to the occupation and subsequent use of Khafji as a launching pad into the initially lightly defended Eastern portion of Saudi Arabia is considered by many academics as a grave strategic error. Not only would Iraq have secured a majority of Middle Eastern oil supplies, it would have found itself better able to threaten the subsequent U.S. deployment along superior defensive lines.


The effect of the air campaign was to devastate entire Iraqi brigades deployed in the open desert in combat formation. The air campaign also prevented effective Iraqi resupply to forward deployed units engaged in combat, as well preventing a large number (450,000) of Iraqi troops from achieving the force concentration essential to victory.


The air campaign had a significant effect on the tactics employed by opposing forces in subsequent conflicts. No longer were entire divisions dug in the open facing U.S. forces, but were instead dispersed, as with 

Serbian forces in Kosovo
. Opposing forces also reduced the length of their supply lines and the total area defended. This was seen during the 2001 
U.S. invasion of Afghanistan when the 

Taliban
 preemptively abandoned large swaths of land and retreated into their strongholds. This increased their force concentration and reduced long vulnerable supply lines. This tactic was also observed in the invasion of Iraq when the Iraqi forces retreated from northern 






Iraqi Kurdistan





 into the cities.





Ground campaign





Ground troop movements from February 24-28th 1991 during Operation Desert Storm.





The coalition forces dominated the air with their technological advantages, but the ground forces were considered to be more evenly matched up between Iraqis and coalition infantry. The coalition ground forces had the significant advantage of being able to operate under the protection of coalition 


Air superiority

 that had been achieved by the 
Air Forces prior to start of the main ground offensive. Coalition forces also had two key technological advantages:



 The Coalition 
Main Battle Tanks such as the American 

M1 Abrams
, British 

Challenger 1
 and Kuwaiti 

M-84AB
 were vastly superior to the 
export version Soviet-built 

T-72
 tanks used by the Iraqis, with crews better trained and armoured doctrine better developed;


 The use of 



GPS


 made it possible for Coalition forces to navigate without reference to roads or other fixed landmarks. This allowed them to fight a 
battle of maneuver rather than a 
battle of encounter: they knew where they were and where the enemy was, so they could attack a specific target, rather than wandering around aimlessly and firing at whatever hostile forces they bumped into.





Initial moves into Iraq


The first units into Iraq were three patrols of B squadron of the British 

Special Air Service
, callsigns 
Bravo One Zero, 
Bravo Two Zero, and 
Bravo Three Zero in late January. These eight man patrols landed behind enemy lines gather intelligence on the movements of Soviet 
Scud mobile missile launchers, which could not be detected from the air, as during the day they would hide under bridges and camouflage netting. Other objectives included the destruction of the launchers and their fibre optic communications arrays that lay in pipelines, relaying coordinates to the 






TEL





 operators launching attacks against 

Syria
.


Elements of the 
2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division performed a covert 
recon into Iraq on 9 February 1991, followed by a recon in force on February 20 that destroyed an Iraqi battalion. On February 22, 1991, Iraq agreed to a 



Soviet


-proposed 
cease-fire agreement. The agreement called for Iraq to withdraw troops to pre-invasion positions within six weeks following a total cease-fire, and called for monitoring of the cease-fire and withdrawal to be overseen by the UN Security Council. The Coalition rejected the proposal but said that retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked, and gave twenty-four hours for Iraq to begin withdrawing forces.




Coalition forces enter Iraq





Shortly afterwards, the 
U.S. VII Corps assembled in full strength and launched an armoured attack into Iraq early Sunday, February 24, just to the west of Kuwait, taking Iraqi forces by surprise. Simultaneously, the 
U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping  left-hook  attack across the largely undefended desert of southern Iraq, led by the 
3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment (3rd ACR) and the 

24th Infantry Division (Mechanised)
. The left flank of this movement was protected by the 
French 6th Light Armoured Division. The fast-moving French force quickly overcame the 
Iraqi 45th Infantry Division, suffering only a handful of casualties, and took up blocking positions to prevent any Iraqi force from attacking the Allied flank. The right flank of the movement was protected by the 
British 1st Armoured Division. Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the 
Republican Guard.

 and his advisors on the progress of the ground war.





The Coalition advance was much swifter than U.S. generals had expected. On February 26, Iraqi troops began retreating out of Kuwait, 










setting fire









 to Kuwaiti oil fields as they left. A long convoy of retreating Iraqi troops formed along the main Iraq-Kuwait highway. This convoy was bombed so extensively by the Allies that it came to be known as the 

Highway of Death
. Critics of the action contend that the column also contained prisoners and other fleeing Iraqi civilians, such as families of Iraqi military units.[] Forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France continued to pursue retreating Iraqi forces over the border and back into Iraq, moving to within 150 miles (240 km) of Baghdad before withdrawing.


One hundred hours after the ground campaign started, U.S. President Bush declared a 
cease-fire and on April 6 declared that Kuwait had been liberated.




Post-war military analysis

Although it was said at the time that Iraqi troops numbered approximately 545,000 (even 600,000) today most experts think that both the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the Iraqi Army at the time were exaggerated, as they included both temporary and auxiliary support elements. Many of the Iraqi troops were also young, under-resourced and poorly trained conscripts.
The Coalition committed approximately 540,000 troops. In addition to these, a further 100,000 Turkish troops were deployed along the common border of Turkey and Iraq. This caused significant force dilution of the Iraqi military by forcing it to deploy its forces along all its borders. This allowed the main thrust by the Americans to not only possess a significant technological advantage but also a superiority in force numbers.


Saddam Hussein bought military equipment from almost every major dealer of the World's weapons market. This resulted in a lack of standardization in this large heterogeneous force, which additionally suffered from poor training and poor motivation. The majority of Iraqi armoured forces still used old Chinese Type-59s and Type-69s, Soviet-made T-55s from the 1950s and 1960s, and some T-72s from the 1970s in 1991. These machines were not equipped with up-to-date equipment, such as a thermal sight or laser rangefinder, and their effectiveness in modern combat was very limited. The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal sights and the 
sabot rounds used by the 

M1 Abrams
, 
Challenger 1 and the other Coalition tanks. This equipment enabled Coalition tanks to effectively engage and destroy Iraqi tanks from more than three times the distance that Iraqi tanks could engage. The Iraqi tank crews used old, cheap steel penetrators against the advanced 
Chobham Armour of these American and British tanks, with disastrous results. The Iraqi forces also failed to utilize the advantage that could be gained from using 
urban warfare   fighting within 

Kuwait City
   which could have inflicted significant casualties on the attacking forces. Urban combat reduces the range at which fighting occurs and can negate some of the technological advantage that well equipped forces enjoy.
Iraqis also tried to copy the Soviet doctrine from the 1950s of mass attacks, but the implementation failed due to the lack of skill of their commanders and the preventive air strikes of the 










U.S. Air Force









 on communication centers and bunkers.





The end of active hostilities


A peace conference was held in Iraqi territory occupied by the coalition. At the conference, Iraq won the approval of the use of armed helicopters on their side of the temporary border, ostensibly for government transit due to the damage done to civilian transportation. Soon after, these helicopters, and much of the Iraqi armed forces, were refocused toward fighting against a 
Shiite uprising in the south. The rebellions were encouraged on 2 February 1991 by a broadcast on CIA run radio station The Voice of Free Iraq broadcasting out of Saudi Arabia. The Arabic service of the Voice of America supported the uprising by stating that the rebellion was large and that they soon would be liberated from Hussein.27


In the North, 

Kurdish
 leaders took heart in American statements that they would support an uprising and began fighting, in the hopes of triggering a 
coup. However, when no American support was forthcoming, Iraqi generals remained loyal and brutally crushed the Kurdish troops. Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Kurdish areas of 
Turkey and 

Iran
. These incidents would later result in 
no-fly zones being established in both the North and the South of Iraq. In Kuwait, the Emir was restored and suspected Iraqi collaborators were repressed. Eventually, over 400,000 people were expelled from the country, including a large number of 
Palestinians (due to their support of and collaboration with Hussein).


There was some criticism of the Bush administration for its decision to allow Saddam Hussein to remain in power, rather than pushing on to capture Baghdad and overthrowing his government. In their co-written 1998 book, 






A World Transformed





, Bush and 

Brent Scowcroft
 argued that such a course would have fractured the alliance and would have had many unnecessary political and human costs associated with it.


In 1992, the 









United States Secretary of Defense








 during the war, 


Dick Cheney

, made the same point:



I would guess if we had gone in there, I would still have forces in Baghdad today. We'd be running the country. We would not have been able to get everybody out and bring everybody home.
And the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of casualties. I don't think you could have done all of that without significant additional U.S. casualties, and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war.
And the question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties is Saddam (Hussein) worth? And the answer is, not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the President made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.28



Instead of greater involvement of its own military, the United States hoped that Saddam Hussein would be overthrown in an internal 
coup d'etat. The 

Central Intelligence Agency
 used its assets in Iraq to organize a revolt, but the Iraqi government defeated the effort.


On March 10, 1991, Operation Desert Storm began to move 540,000 American troops out of the 

Persian Gulf
.

Operation Granby







 was the name for the operations in the Persian Gulf. 
British Army regiments (mainly with the 

British 1st Armoured Division)

Royal Navy



 vessels, and 

Royal Air Force
 squadrons were mobilised to the Gulf. The Royal Air Force, using various aircraft, operated from 
airbases in Saudi Arabia. Almost 2,500 armoured vehicles and 43,000 troops29 were shipped for action.


Chief Royal Navy vessels deployed to the gulf included a number of 



Broadsword-class frigates


, and 



Sheffield-class destroyers


, other RN and 
RFA ships were also deployed. The light aircraft carrier 





HMS Ark Royal''




 was not deployed to the Gulf area, but was deployed to the 
Mediterranean Sea.




France


The second largest European contingent was from France, with 18,000 troops.29 Operating on the left flank of the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, the main French army force was the 6th Light Armoured Division, including troops from the 

French Foreign Legion
. Initially, the French operated independently under national command and control, but coordinated closely with the Americans, Saudis and 
CENTCOM. In January, the Division was placed under the tactical control of the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps. France also deployed combat aircraft and naval units. The French called their contribution 
Operation Daguet.

Canada
 was one of the first nations to agree to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and it quickly agreed to join the U.S.-led coalition. In August 1990, 

Prime Minister
 


Brian Mulroney

 committed the 

Canadian Forces
 to deploy the destroyers 
HMCS Terra Nova'' and 
HMCS Athabaskan'' to join the maritime interdiction force. The supply ship 
HMCS Protecteur'' was also sent to aid the gathering coalition logistics forces in the Persian Gulf. A fourth ship, 
HMCS Huron'' arrived in-theatre after hostilities ceased and visited Kuwait.


After the UN authorised full use of force against Iraq, the Canadian Forces deployed a 
CF-18 squadron with support personnel as well as a 
field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war. When the air war began, Canada's CF-18s were integrated into the coalition force and were tasked with providing air cover and attacking ground targets. This was the first time since the 

Korean War
 that the Canadian military had participated in offensive combat operations.




Norway


In recent years, the work of 



Norwegian


 intelligence personnel during the Gulf War has become public.


Norwegian intelligence personnel, at a listening post in the North of Norway, were in secrecy presented with high ranking awards for their work in saving shot down American pilots during the Gulf War.


During the Gulf War, 63 American pilots were shot down. Rescuing the 12 downed pilots trapped behind enemy lines was a very high priority and the United States devoted a large amount of resources to doing so. The pilots were fitted with emergency beepers, so that the Americans, via satellite could locate them.


However, the USA satellite coverage was not always present and American officials, refusing to leave any man behind, started looking around for other methods of locating their pilots. It was then that a small listening post located in Norway, above the Arctic Circle proved helpful. The Norwegian listening post continually listened to Soviet spy satellites, which received the signals from the American pilots without a problem. The Norwegian intelligence personnel  stole  the information they got by spying on the Soviet satellites and forwarded it to American personnel which could then get into the war theater at the correct location and save the pilots.


Several American pilots were saved because of this listening post in Norway. The personnel received diplomas signed by U.S. President George H. W. Bush himself.30


Norway also deployed a Field Medical Company as part of Operation Granby from January to May 1991. About 230 strong, this Army unit was stationed in Al Jubayl for the duration of the war supporting the British units. Luckily, the unit had very little medical work to do with allies, but some Iraqi injured were sent there. There was plenty of scope for preventive public health work for which the unit was also equipped.31

Casualties



Coalition losses



The DoD reports that U.S. forces suffered 148 battle-related deaths, plus 

one pilot
 listed as 
MIA (further 145 Americans died in out-of-combat accidents). The UK suffered 47 deaths, 38 from Iraqi fire, France 2, and the Arab countries suffered 39 fatalities(18 Saudis, 10 Egyptians, 6 from the UAE, 3 Syrians, and 1 Kuwaiti).3334


The largest single loss of Coalition forces happened on February 25, 1991, when an 

Iraq
i 

Al-Hussein missile
 hit an American military barrack in 

Dhahran
, 

Saudi Arabia
 killing 28 
U.S. Army Reservists from 





Pennsylvania




. In all, 181 coalition troops were killed by Iraqi fire, 102 of them American. Out of a total of 358 coalition deaths, this showed how poor the Iraqi army was compared to the coalition forces. The rest were killed by 
friendly fire, exploding munitions, or out of combat accidents.


The number of coalition wounded in combat seems to have been 776, including 458 Americans.35


However, as of the year 2000, 183,000 U.S. veterans of the Gulf War, more than a quarter of the U.S. troops who participated in War, have been declared permanently disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs 36. About 30% of the 700,000 men and women who served in U.S. forces during the Gulf War still suffer an array of serious symptoms whose causes are not fully understood.37



Friendly fire


While the death toll among Coalition forces engaging Iraqi combatants was very low, a substantial number of deaths were caused by accidental attacks from other allied units. Of the 148 American troops who died in battle, 24% were killed by 
friendly fire, a total of 35 service personnel. A further 11 died in detonations of allied munitions. Nine British service personnel were also killed in a friendly fire incident when a 










USAF









 

A-10A Thunderbolt-II
 attacked a group of two Warrior 
IFVs.




Pre-war estimates


Before the war Pentagon officials were estimating 30,000-40,000 coalition casualties.



The Dupuy Institute stood alone and in front of Congress predicted coalition casualties below 6,000. They used the TNDM model which makes use of historical data from previous wars to predict casualties (the model makes use of 'human' factors such as morale and they predicted that very few Iraqi divisions would put up resistance).





Iraqi deaths


The exact number of Iraqi combat casualties is unknown, but known to be heavy. Immediate estimates said up to 100,000 Iraqis were killed. Some now estimate that Iraq sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 fatalities. However other figures still maintain fatalities as high as 200,000.38


A report commissioned by the U.S. Air Force, estimated 10,000-12,000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign and as many as 10,000 casualties in the ground war.39 This analysis is based on Iraqi prisoner of war reports. It is known that between 20,000 and 200,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed.


Saddam Hussein's government gave high civilian casualty figures in order to draw support from the islamic countries. The Iraqi government claimed that 2,300 civilians died during the air campaign.


According to the Project on Defense Alternatives study40, 3,664 Iraqi civilians and between 20,000 and 26,000 military personnel were killed in the conflict. 75,000 Iraqi soldiers were wounded in the fighting.




Israeli Civilian losses


39 Scud missiles were fired by Iraq into Israel during the seven weeks of the war. Three Israeli people died due to these attacks, in addition to approximately 78 injured. Several others suffered fatal heart attacks immediately after the missile strikes. The attacks caused damage to property, and demoralised the Israeli population. Israel, a nation who has always defended her people, was eager to respond with military force to these attacks, but agreed not to when asked by the U.S. Government. (It was feared that if Israel got involved, the other Arab nations would either desert from the coalition or join Iraq.)  Israel was given two batteries of 
















MIM-104 Patriot















 missiles for the protection of Civilians.41




Civilian deaths


The increased importance of air attacks from both warplanes and cruise missiles led to much controversy over the level of civilian deaths caused during the initial stages of the war. Within the first 24 hours of the war, more than 1,000 sorties were flown, many of them against targets in 

Baghdad
. The city received heavy bombing due to being the seat of power for President 


Saddam Hussein

 and the Iraqi forces' 
command and control. However, this also led to substantial civilian casualties.


During the long bombing campaign prior to the ground war, many aerial attacks led to civilian casualties. In one particularly notable event, stealth bombers attacked a bunker in Amirya, causing the deaths of between 200 and 400 civilians who were taking refuge there at the time. Subsequently, scenes of burned and mutilated bodies were broadcast and controversy raged over the status of the bunker, with some stating that it was a civilian shelter while others contended that it was a centre of Iraqi military operations and the civilians had been deliberately moved there to act as 
human shields. Some estimates 2,300 to 200,000 Iraqi civilians were killed during the war. Other research, such as an investigation by 
Beth Osborne Daponte, has speculated on civilian fatalites as high as 100,000. 38 Notably, the deaths of civilians and damage to civilian areas was expressly avoided by coalition forces, unlike previous campaigns such as the 














Bombing of Tokyo in World War II













.





Gulf War controversies



Gulf War illness





Main article: 
Gulf War syndrome

Many returning coalition soldiers reported illnesses following their participation in the Gulf War, a phenomenon known as Gulf War syndrome or Gulf War illness. There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and reported birth defects. Some factors considered as possibly causal include exposure to 
depleted uranium, 
chemical weapons, 
anthrax vaccine given to deploying soldiers, and/or infectious diseases. 









Major Michael Donnelly








, a former USAF officer during the Gulf War, helped publicize the syndrome and advocated for veterans' rights in this regard.

U.S. Navy jets pursued and destroyed the convoy in a controversial attack, subjecting it to sustained bombing for several hours. The convoy also contained some stolen vehicles loaded up with stolen 'loot' from Kuwait.




Bulldozer assault


Another incident during the war highlighted the question of large-scale Iraqi combat deaths. This was the  
bulldozer assault , wherein two brigades from the 
1st Infantry Division (Mechanised) used anti-mine plows mounted on 
tanks and combat earthmovers to bury Iraqi soldiers defending the fortified  Saddam Line.  One newspaper story reported that the U.S. commanders estimated thousands of Iraqi soldiers surrendered, escaping burial during the two-day assault February 24-25, 1991. However, like all other troop estimates made during the war, the estimated 8,000 Iraqi defenders was probably greatly inflated. After the war, the Iraqi government claimed to have found 44 bodies.45




Abuse of coalition POWs


Iraq displayed 
POWs on TV with visible signs of abuse who were disavowing the coalition's warfare. It has also been alleged that coalition POWs were tortured by the Iraqis.




Crossing Iraqi borders

Please see the relevant discussion on the .(May 2008)''




Having driven Iraqi forces over the border from Kuwait, some coalition troops stood down, but forces from the USA, UK, and France continued to pursue the retreating remnants of the Iraq forces across into Iraqi territory. Disagreements arose over whether the UN mandate to eject Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait allowed the coalition to enter Iraqi sovereign territory or not, with some military officials arguing that it was necessary to prevent them from regrouping and attempting a counter-attack. Later it was found that the mandate should have prevented any coalition forces from occupying any Iraqi soil.




Gulf War oil spill


On January 23, Iraq was accused of 









dumping








 400 million gallons of 
crude oil into the 

Persian Gulf
, causing the largest 
oil spill in history.46 It was reported as a deliberate natural resources attack to keep U.S. Marine forces from coming ashore. This was denied by the Iraqi government, who claimed that the allied bombing campaign had damaged and destroyed Iraqi oil tankers that were docked at the time.





Cost


The cost of the war to the United States was calculated by the 

United States Congress
 to be $61.1 billion.47. About $52 billion of that amount was paid by different countries around the world: $36 billion by 

Kuwait
, 

Saudi Arabia
 and other Persian Gulf States; $16 billion by 

Germany
 and 
Japan (which sent no combat forces due to its constitution). About 25% of 

Saudi Arabia
's contribution was paid in the form of in-kind services to the troops, such as 
food and 
transportation.47 U.S. troops represented about 74% of the combined force, and the global cost was therefore higher.


By comparison, the 
cost of the 2003 Iraq War was at least an order of magnitude higher.




Media


The Persian Gulf War was a heavily 
televised war. For the first time people all over the world were able to watch live pictures of 
missiles hitting their targets and fighters taking off from 
aircraft carriers. Allied forces were keen to demonstrate the accuracy of their weapons.


In the 








United States







, the  big three  network anchors led the 
network news coverage of the war: 

ABC
's 

Peter Jennings
, 

CBS
's 



Dan Rather


, and 

NBC
's 

Tom Brokaw
 were anchoring their evening newscasts when air strikes began on January 16, 1991. 
ABC News correspondent 
Gary Shepard, reporting live from Baghdad, told Jennings of the quietness of the city. But, moments later, Shepard was back on the air as flashes of light were seen on the horizon and tracer fire was heard on the ground. On CBS, viewers were watching a report from correspondent 
Allen Pizzey, who was also reporting from Baghdad, when the war began. Rather, after the report was finished, announced that there were unconfirmed reports of flashes in Baghdad and heavy 
air traffic at bases in Saudi Arabia. On the  NBC Nightly News , correspondent 







Mike Boettcher






 reported unusual air activity in 

Dhahran
, 

Saudi Arabia
. Moments later, Brokaw announced to his viewers that the air attack had begun.


Still, it was 
CNN which gained the most popularity for their coverage, and indeed its wartime coverage is often cited as one of the landmark events in the development of the network. CNN correspondents 






John Holliman





 and 


Peter Arnett

 and CNN anchor 
Bernard Shaw relayed audio reports from the 




Al-Rashid Hotel



 as the air strikes began. The network had previously convinced the Iraqi government to allow installation of a permanent audio circuit in their makeshift bureau. When the telephones of all of the other Western TV correspondents went dead during the bombing, CNN was the only service able to provide live reporting. After the initial bombing, Arnett remained behind and was, for a time, the only American TV correspondent reporting from Iraq.


Newspapers all over the world also covered the war and 

TIME Magazine
 published a special issue dated January 28, 1991, the headline  WAR IN THE GULF  emblazoned on the cover over a picture of Baghdad taken as the war began.


U.S. policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the 

Vietnam War
. The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled 
Annex Foxtrot. Most of the press information came from briefings organised by the military. Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers. Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and 
censorship afterward. This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq. This policy was heavily influenced by the military's experience with the 

Vietnam War
, which it believed it had lost due to public opposition within the United States.


At the same time, the coverage of this war was new in its instantaneousness. About halfway through the war, Iraq's government decided to allow live satellite transmissions from the country by Western news organisations, and American journalists returned en masse to 

Baghdad
. 
Tom Aspell of 







NBC






, 
Bill Blakemore of 
ABC, and 
Betsy Aaron of 
CBS filed reports, subject to acknowledged Iraqi 
censorship. Throughout the war, footage of incoming missiles was broadcast almost immediately. A British crew from 
CBS News (David Green and Andy Thompson), equipped with satellite transmission equipment traveled with the front line forces and, having transmitted live TV pictures of the fighting en route, arrived the day before the forces in 

Kuwait City
, broadcasting live television from the city and covering the entrance of the Arab forces the following day.






Technology












Precision guided munitions





 (PGMs, also  smart bombs ), such as the 










United States Air Force









 guided missile AGM-130, were heralded as key in allowing military strikes to be made with a minimum of civilian casualties compared to previous wars. Specific buildings in downtown 

Baghdad
 could be bombed whilst journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by. PGMs amounted to approximately 7.4% of all bombs dropped by the coalition. Other bombs included 
cluster bombs, which disperse numerous submunitions48, and 








daisy cutters







, 15,000-pound bombs which can disintegrate everything within hundreds of yards.



Scud is a tactical 
ballistic missile that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed 




Red Army



 divisions in 

East Germany
. The role of the Scuds which were armed with nuclear and chemical warheads was to destroy command, control, and communication facilities and delay full mobilisation of Western German and Allied Forces in 

Germany
. It could also be used to directly target ground forces. Scud missiles utilise inertial guidance which operates for the duration that the engines operate. Iraq used Scud missiles, launching them into both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Some missiles caused extensive casualties, while others caused little damage. Concerns were raised of possible chemical or biological warheads on these rockets, but if they existed they were not used. Scud missiles are not as effective at delivering chemical payloads as is commonly believed because intense 
heat during the Scud's flight at approximately 
Mach 5 denatures most of the chemical payload. Chemical weapons are inherently better suited to being delivered by cruise missiles or fighter bombers. The Scud is best suited to delivering tactical nuclear warheads, a role for which it is as capable today as it was when it was first developed.


The USA's 
















Patriot missile















 was used for the first time in combat. The U.S. military claimed a high effectiveness against Scuds at the time. Later estimates of the Patriot's effectiveness range widely. Further, there is at least one incident of a software error causing a Patriot missile's failure to engage an incoming Scud, resulting in deaths.49


Unclassified evidence on Scud interception is lacking. The higher estimates are based on the percentage of Scud warheads which were known to have impacted and exploded compared to the number of Scud missiles launched, but other factors such as duds, misses and impacts which were not reported confound these. Some Scud variations were re-engineered in a manner outside their original tolerance, and said to have frequently failed or broken up in flight. The lowest estimates are typically based upon the number of interceptions where there is proof that the warhead was hit by at least one missile, but due to the way the Al-Hussein (Scud derivative) missiles broke up in flight, it was often hard to tell which piece was the warhead, and there were few radar tracks which were actually stored which could be analyzed later. Realistically the actual performance will not be known for many years. The U.S. Army and the manufacturers maintain the Patriot delivered a  miracle performance  in the Gulf War.50






Global Positioning System


 units were key in enabling coalition units to navigate easily across the desert.



Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) and satellite communication systems were also important. 2 examples of this is the E-2 Hawkeye 
U.S. Navy and the E-3 Sentry 
USAF. Both were used in command and control area of operations. They provided essential communications link between the ground forces, air forces, and the navy. It is one the many reasons why the air war during the Gulf war was dominated by the Coalition Forces.

Symptoms
Fear
Obsolete medical terms
Greek loanwords




This article is about the state of mind.  For other uses, see 
Hysteria (disambiguation).
Hysteria, in its colloquial use, describes a state of 
mind, one of unmanageable 
fear or 
emotional excesses.  The fear is often caused by multiple events in one's past that involved some sort of severe conflict; the fear can be centered on a body part or most commonly on an imagined problem with that body part (
disease is a common complaint. And see also 

Body dysmorphic disorder
 and 
Hypochondriasis. People who are  hysterical  often lose self-control due to the overwhelming fear.

Psychiatrists and other physicians have in theory given up the use of  hysteria , replacing it with more euphemistic terms that are essentially synonyms. These include  psychosomatic ,  functional ,  nonorganic ,  
psychogenic , and  medically unexplained . In 1980 the 



American Psychiatric Association


 officially changed the diagnosis of  hysterical neurosis, conversion type  to  
conversion disorder . Hysteria also has significant overlap with the diagnostic term  somatization disorder  and with somatoform disorders in general.



History





Main article: 





Female hysteria






The term originates with the 

Greek
 
medical term, hysterikos. This referred to a medical condition, thought to be particular to 
women, caused by disturbances of the 
uterus, hystera in Greek. The term hysteria was coined by 


Hippocrates

, who thought that suffocation and madness arose in women whose uteri had become too light and dry from lack of sexual intercourse and, as a result, wandered upward, compressing the heart, lungs, and diaphragm.  


The same general definition, or under the name 
female hysteria, came into widespread use in the middle and late 19th century to describe what is today generally considered to be 
sexual dissatisfaction.1 Typical treatment was massage of the patient's genitalia by the physician and later 
vibrators or water sprays to cause 
orgasm.1 By the early 1900s, the practice and usage of the term had fallen from use until it was again popularized when the writings of 


Sigmund Freud

 became known and influential in 











Britain










 and the 
USA in the 1920s. The 
Freudian 
psychoanalytic school of 
psychology uses its own, somewhat controversial, ways to treat hysteria. 


The knowledge of hysterical processes was advanced by the work of 

Jean-Martin Charcot
, a  French 
neurologist.  However, many now consider hysteria to be a legacy diagnosis (i.e., a catch-all junk diagnosis),2 particularly due to its long list of possible manifestations: one Victorian physician cataloged 75 pages of possible symptoms of hysteria and called the list incomplete.3.


Current psychiatric terminology distinguishes two types of hysteria: somatoform and dissociative. Dissociative hysteria includes amnestic 
fugue states. Somatoform disorders include conversion disorder, somatization disorder, chronic pain disorder, hypochondriasis, and body dysmorphic disorder. In somatoform disorders, the patient exhibits physical symptoms such as low back pain or limb paralysis, without apparent physical cause. Recent neuroscientific research, however, is starting to show that there are characteristic patterns of brain activity associated with these states. All these disorders are thought to be unconscious, not feigned or intentional malingering. 


Freudian psychoanalytic theory attributed hysterical symptoms to the subconscious mind's attempt to protect the patient from psychic stress. Subconscious motives include primary gain, in which the symptom directly relieves the stress (as when a patient coughs to release energy pent up from keeping a secret), and secondary gain, in which the symptom provides an independent advantage such as staying home from a hated job. More recent critics have noted the possibility of tertiary gain, when a patient is induced subconsciously to display a symptom because of the desires of others (as when a controlling husband enjoys the docility of his sick wife). There need be no gain at all, however, in a hysterical symptom. A child playing hockey may fall and for several hours believe he is unable to move, because he has recently heard of a famous hockey player who fell and broke his neck.



Jungian psychologist Laurie Layton Schapira explored what she labels a  
Cassandra Complex  suffered by those traditionally diagnosed with hysteria, denoting a tendency for those with hysteria to be disbelieved or dismissed when relating the facticity of their experiences to others.4 Based on clinical experience, she delineates three factors which constitute the Cassandra complex in hysterics: (a). dysfunctional relationships with social manifestations of rationality, order, and reason, leading to; (b). emotional or physical suffering, particularly in the form of somatic, often gynaecological complaints, and 
(c). being disbelieved or dismissed when attempting to relate the facticity of these experiences to others.5




Mass hysteria





Main article: 
Mass hysteria

The term also occurs in the phrase mass hysteria to describe mass public near-panic reactions. It is commonly applied to the waves of popular medical problems that  everyone gets  in response to news articles.


A similar usage refers to any sort of  public wave  phenomenon, and has been used to describe the periodic widespread reappearance and public interest in 
UFO reports, 
crop circles, and similar examples. Also, when information, real or fake, becomes misinterpreted but believed, e.g. 
penis panic.


Hysteria is often associated with movements like the 
Salem Witch Trials, 
McCarthyism, the 




First Red Scare



, the 
Second Red Scare and 
Terrorism where it is better understood through the related sociological term of 
moral panic.

Richard Porson (
25 December 
1759   
25 September 
1808) was an 

English
 
classical scholar. He was the discoverer of 
Porson's Law; and the Greek typeface 
Porson was based on his handwriting. 


Early life



He was born at 





East Ruston




, near 

North Walsham
, in 

Norfolk
, the eldest son of Huggin Person, parish clerk. His mother was the daughter of a shoemaker from the neighbouring village of 

Bacton
. He was sent first to the village school at Bacton, kept by John Woodrow, and afterwards to that of 





Happisburgh




 kept by Mr Summers, where his extraordinary powers of memory and aptitude for arithmetic were soon discovered. His literary skill was partly due to the efforts of Summers, who long afterwards stated that during fifty years of scholastic life he had never come across boys so clever as Porson and his two brothers. He was well grounded in 

Latin
 by Summers, remaining with him for three years. His father also took pains with his education, making him repeat at night the lessons he had learned in the day. He would frequently repeat without making a mistake a lesson which he had learned one or two years before and had never seen in the interval. For books he had only what his father's cottage supplied -- a book or two of arithmetic, 






John Greenwood





's England, 








Jewell's







 Apology, and an odd volume of Chambers' Cyclopaedia picked up from a wrecked coaster, and eight or ten volumes of the Universal Magazine.




Education



When Porson was eleven, the 
curate of East Ruston took charge of his education. Mr Hewitt taught him with his own boys, taking him through 


Julius Caesar

, 







Terence






, 



Ovid


 and 



Virgil


; he had already made great progress in mathematics. In addition, Hewitt brought him under the notice of Mr Norris of 





Witton Park




, who sent him to 
Cambridge to be examined by Professor Lambert, the two tutors of 







Trinity College, Cambridge






, Postlethwaite and Collier, and the well-known mathematician 

George Atwood
, then assistant tutor; the result was so favourable that Mr Norris determined to provide for his education. This was in 1773. It was impossible to get him into 

Charterhouse School
, and he was entered at 

Eton College
 in August 1774.


Porson did not care for Eton, but he was popular there; and two dramas he wrote for performance in the Long Chamber were remembered many years later. His marvellous memory was noticed; but he seems to have disappointed the expectations of his friends, as his composition was weak, and he fell behind several of his inferiors through small gaps in his knowledge. He went to Eton too late to have any chance of succeeding to a scholarship at 







King's College, Cambridge






. In 1777 his patron, Mr Norris, died; but contributions from Etonians helped fund his maintenance at the university, and he found a successor to Norris in Sir 
George Baker, the physician, at that time president of the college of physicians. Chiefly through his means Porson was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 
28 March 
1778, matriculating in April. It is said that what first biased his mind towards literary criticism was the gift of a copy of 

Jonathan Toup
's Longinus by the head master of Eton; but it was 
















Richard Bentley















 and 













Richard Dawes












 to whom he looked as his immediate masters. He became a scholar of Trinity in 1780, won the Craven university scholarship in 1781, and took his degree of B.A. in 1782, as third senior prime, obtaining soon afterwards the first chancellor's medal for classical studies. The same year he was elected Fellow of Trinity, a very unusual thing for junior bachelor of arts, as the junior bachelors were rarely allowed to be candidates for fellowships, a regulation which lasted from 1667 when 


Isaac Newton

 was elected till 1818 when 
Connop Thirlwall became a fellow. Porson graduated M.A. in 1785.




Early published work



Having secured his independence, he turned his thoughts to publication. His first appearance in print was in a short notice of Schlitz's Aeschylus in Maty. Review, written in 1783. This review contains several other essays by his hand; especially may be mentioned the review of 
RF Brunck's Aristophanes (containing an able summary of the poet's chief excellencies and defects), 
Weston's Hermesianax, and Huntingford's Apology for the Monostrophics. But it was to the tragedians, and especially to Aeschylus, that his mind was then chiefly directed. He began a correspondence with 






David Ruhnken





, the veteran scholar of 
Leiden, requesting to be favoured with any fragments of 


Aeschylus

 that Ruhnken had come across in his collection of inedited lexicons and grammarians, and sending him, as a proof that he was not undertaking a task for which he was unequal, some specimens of his critical powers, and especially of his restoration of a very corrupt passage in the Supplices (673 677) by the help of a nearly equally corrupt passage of 





Plutarch




's Eroticus.


As the Cambridge press was proposing to re-edit 












Thomas Stanley











's Aeschylus, the editorship was offered to Porson; but he declined to undertake it on the conditions laid down, namely, of reprinting Stanley's corrupt text and incorporating all the variorum notes. He was especially anxious that the Medicean manuscript at 

Florence
 should be collated for the new edition, and offered to undertake the collation at an expense not greater than it would have cost if done by a person on the spot; but the syndics refused the offer, the vice-chancellor (Mr Torkington, master of Clare Hall) observing that Porson might collect his manuscripts at home.


In 1786, a new edition of Hutchinson's Anabasis of 


















Xenophon

















 was called for, and Porson was asked by the publisher to supply notes, which he did in conjunction with the Rev. W Whiter, editor of the Etymologicon universale. These are a good example of the neat and terse style of Latin notes he practised. They also show his intimate acquaintance with his two favourite authors, 


Plato

 and 






Athenaeus





, and a familiarity with 
Eustathius Macrembolites's commentary on 
Homer.


The following year Porson wrote his Notae breves ad Tonpii emendationes in Suidam, though this treatise did not appear till 1790 in the new edition of Toup's book published at Oxford. These first made Porson's name known as a scholar of the first rank, and carried his fame beyond England. The letters he received from 
Christian G. Heyne and 







G Hermann






 preserved in the library of Trinity College, and written before his Euripides was published, afford proof of this. In his notes he points out the errors of Toup and others; at the same time he speaks of Toup's book as  opus illud aureum,  and states that his writing the notes at all is due to the admiration he had for it. They contain some brilliant emendations of various authors; but the necessity of having Toup's own notes with them has prevented their ever being reprinted in a separate form.


During 1787 he wrote three letters on Hawkins's Life of Johnson for the Gentleman's Magazine, which have been reprinted by 





Thomas Kidd




 in his Tracts and Criticisms of Porson, and in a volume of Porson's Correspondence. They are admirable specimens of the dry humour so characteristic of the writer, and prove his intimate acquaintance with 





Shakespeare




 and the other English dramatists and poets. In the same periodical, in the course of 1788 and 1789, appeared the Letters to Archdeacon Travis, on the spurious verse 
1 John 5:7 (collected in 1790 into a volume), which must be considered to have settled the question.



Reception





Gibbon
's verdict on the book, that it was  the most acute and accurate piece of criticism since the days of Bentley,  may be considered as somewhat partial, as it was in defence of him that Porson had entered the field against Travis. But in the masterly sketch of Gibbon's work and style in the preface Porson does not write in a merely flattering tone. It is to be wished that on such a subject the tone of levity had been modified. But Porson says in his preface that he could treat the subject in no other manner, if he treated it at all:  To peruse such a mass of falsehood and sophistry and to write remarks upon it, without sometimes giving way to laughter and sometimes to indignation, was, to me at least, impossible.  Travis has no mercy shown him, but he certainly deserved none. One is equally struck with the thorough grasp Porson displays of his subject, the amount of his miscellaneous learning, and the humour that pervades the whole. But it was then the unpopular side: the publisher is said to have lost money by the book; and one of his early friends, Mrs Turner of Norwich, cut down a legacy she had left Porson to  30 on being told that he had written what was described to her as a book against Christianity.


During the years that followed Porson continued to contribute to the leading reviews, writing in the Monthly Review the articles on Robertson's Parian Chronicle, Edwards's Plutarch, and R Payne Knight's Essay on the Greek Alphabet. He gave assistance to William Beloe in one or two articles in the British Critick, and probably wrote also in the 
Analytical Review and the Critical Review.





Loss of fellowship



In 1792 his fellowship was no longer tenable by a layman; and, rather than undertake duties for which he felt himself unfit, and which involved subscription to the Articles (though he had no difficulty as to signing a statement as to his conformity with the liturgy of the 

Church of England
 when elected Greek professor), he determined not to take holy orders, which would have enabled him to remain a fellow, and thus deprived himself of his only means of subsistence. He might have been retained in the society by being appointed to a lay fellowship, one of the two permanent lay fellowships which the statutes then permitted falling vacant just in time. It is said that this had been promised him, and it was certainly the custom in the college always to appoint the senior among the existing laymen, who otherwise would vacate his fellowship. But the master (Dr Postlethwaite), who had the nomination, used his privilege to nominate a younger man (John Heys), a nephew of his own, and thus Porson was turned adrift without any means of support. A subscription was, however, got up among his friends to provide an annuity to keep him from actual want; Cracherode, Cleaver Banks, Burney and Parr took the lead, and enough was collected to produce about  100 a year. He accepted it only on the condition that he should receive the interest during his lifetime, and that the principal, placed in the hands of trustees, should be returned to the donors at his death. When this occurred they or their survivors refused to receive the money, and it was with part of this sum that, in 1816, the Porson prize was founded to perpetuate his name at Cambridge. The remainder was devoted to the foundation of the Porson scholarship in the same university. This scholarship was first awarded in 1855.


After the loss of his fellowship he continued chiefly to reside in 

London
, having chambers in Essex Court, Temple -- occasionally visiting his friends, such as Dr Goodall at Eton and Dr Samuel Parr at Hatton. It was at Dr Goodall's house that the Letters to Travis were written, and at one period of his life he spent a great deal of time at Hatton. While there he would generally spend his mornings in the library, and for the most part in silence; but in the evenings, especially if Parr were away, he would collect the young men of the house about him, and pour forth from memory torrents of every kind of literature. The charms of his society are described as being then irresistible. In 1792 the Greek professorship at Cambridge became vacant by the resignation of Mr Cooke. To this Porson was elected without opposition, and he continued to hold it till his death. The duties then consisted in taking a part in the examinations for the university scholarships and classical medals. It was said he wished to give lectures; but lecturing was not in fashion in those days, and he did far more to advance the knowledge and study of the Greek language by his publications than he could have done by any amount of lecturing. It must be remembered that the emoluments of the professorship were only  40 a year.




Later work



The authors on which his time was chiefly spent were the tragedians, 

Aristophanes
, 






Athenaeus





, and the lexicons of 
Suidas, 
Hesychius and 
Photius. This last he twice transcribed (the first transcript having been destroyed by a fire at Perry's house, which deprived the world of much valuable matter that he had written on the margins of his books) from the original among the Gale manuscripts in the library of Trinity College. Of the brilliancy and accuracy of his emendations on Aristophanes the fragments of the other comic poets, and the lexicographer he had a pleasing proof on one occasion when he found how often in Aristophanes he had been anticipated by Bentley, and on another when Schow's collation of the unique manuscripts of Hesychius appeared and proved him right in  an incredible number  of instances. In 1795 there appeared from Foulis's press at Glasgow an edition of Aeschylus in folio, printed with the same type as the Glasgow Homer, without a word of preface or anything to give a clue to the editor. Many new readings were inserted in the text with an asterisk affixed, while an obelus was used to mark many others as corrupt. It was at once recognized as Porson's work; he had superintended the printing of a small edition in two vols. 8vo, but this was kept back by the printer and not issued till 1806, still without the editor's name. There are corrections of many more passages in this edition than in the folio; and, though the text cannot be considered as what would have gone forth if with his name and sanction, yet more is done for the text of Aeschylus than had been accomplished by any preceding editor. It has formed the substratum for all subsequent editions. It was printed from a copy of Pauw's edition corrected, which is preserved in the library of Trinity College.


Soon after this, in 1797, appeared the first instalment of what was intended to be a complete edition of 







Euripides






 -- an edition of the Hecuba.


In the preface he pointed out the correct method of writing several words previously incorrectly written, and gave some specimens of his powers on the subject of Greek metres. The notes are very short, almost entirely critical; but so great a range of learning, combined with such felicity of emendation whenever a corrupt passage was encountered, is displayed that there was never any doubt as to the quarter whence the new edition had proceeded. He avoided the office of interpreter in his notes, which may well be wondered at on recollecting how admirably he did translate when he condescended to that branch of an editor's duties.



Reception



His work, however, did not escape attack; Gilbert Wakefield had already published a Tragoediarum delectus; and, conceiving himself to be slighted, as there was no mention of his labours in the new Hecuba, he wrote a diatribe extemporalis against it, a tract which for bad taste, bad Latin and bad criticism it would not be easy to match. 
Gottfried Hermann of Leipzig, then a very young man, who had also written a work on Greek metres, which Dr Elmsley has styled  a book of which too much ill cannot easily be said,  issued an edition of the Hecuba, in which Porson's theories were openly attacked. Porson at first took no notice of either, but went on quietly with his 







Euripides






, publishing the Orestes in 1798, the Phoenissae in 1799 and the Medea in 1801, the last printed at the Cambridge press, and with the editor's name on the title-page. But there are many allusions to his antagonists in the notes on such points as the final v, the use of accents, etc.; and on v. 675 of the Medea he holds up Hermann by name to scorn in caustic and taunting language. And it is more than probable that to Hermann's attack we owe the most perfect of his works, the supplement to the preface to the Hecuba, prefixed to the second edition published at Cambridge in 1802.


The metrical laws promulgated are laid down clearly, illustrated with an ample number of examples, and those that militate against them brought together and corrected, so that what had been beyond the reach of the ablest scholars of preceding times is made clear to the tyro. The laws of the iambic metre are fully explained, and the theory of the pause stated and proved, which had been only alluded to in the first edition. A third edition of the Hecuba appeared in 1808, and he left corrected copies of the other plays, of which new editions appeared soon after his death; but these four plays were all that was accomplished of the projected edition of the poet. Porson lived six years after the second edition of the Hecuba was published, but his natural indolence and procrastination led him to put off the work. He found time, however, to execute his collation of the Harleian manuscript of the 
Odyssey, published in the Grenville Homer in 1801, and to present to the 
Society of Antiquaries his wonderful conjectural restoration of the 
Rosetta stone.





Later life and death



In 1806, when the 



London Institution


 was founded in the 





Old Jewry




, he was appointed principal librarian with a salary of  200 a year and a suite of rooms; and thus his latter years were made easy as far as money was concerned.


Among his most intimate friends was Perry, the editor of the Morning Chronicle; and this friendship was cemented by his marriage with Perry's sister, Mrs Lunan, in November 1796. The marriage was a happy one for the short time it lasted, as Porson became more attentive to times and seasons, and would have been weaned from his habits of drinking; but she sank in a decline a few months after her marriage (
12 April 
1797), and he returned to his chambers in the Temple and his old habits. Perry's friendship was of great value to him in many ways; but it induced him to spend too much of his time in writing for the Morning Chronicle; indeed he was even accused of ?giving up to Perry what was meant for mankind,? and the existence of some of the papers he wrote there can be only deplored.


For some months before his death he had appeared to be failing: his memory was not what it had been, and he had some symptoms of intermittent fever; but on 
19 September 
1808 he was seized in the street with a fit of 
apoplexy, and after partially recovering died on the 25th. He was buried in Trinity College, close to the statue of Newton, at the opposite end of the chapel to where rest the remains of Bentley.

In learning Porson was superior to 
Valckenaer, in accuracy to Bentley. It must be remembered that in his day the science of comparative philology had scarcely any existence; even the comparative value of manuscripts was scarcely considered in editing an ancient author. With many editors manuscripts were treated as of much the same value, whether they were really from the hand of a trustworthy scribe, or what Bentley calls  scrub manuscripts,  or  scoundrel copies.  Thus, if we are to find fault with Porson's way of editing, it is that he does not make sufficient difference between the manuscripts he uses, or point out the relative value of the early copies whether in manuscript or print. Thus he collates minutely 
















Lascaris















's edition of the Medea, mentioning even misprints in the text, rather from its rarity and costliness than from its intrinsic value. And his wonderful quickness at emendation has sometimes led him into error, which greater investigation into manuscripts would have avoided; thus, in his note on Eur., Phoen.. 1373 an error, perhaps a misprint (   for   ), in the first edition of the scholiast on 

Sophocles
 has led him into an emendation of v. 339 of the Trachiniae which clearly will not stand. But his most brilliant emendations, such as some of those on Athenaeus, on the Supplices of Aeschylus, or, to take one single instance, that on Eur. Helen. 751 (   '        for         ; see Maltby's Thesaurus, p. 299), are such as convince the reader of their absolute certainty; and this power was possessed by Porson to a degree no one else has ever attained. No doubt his mathematical training had something to do with this; frequently the process may be seen by which the truth has been reached.


A few words are called for on his general character. No one ever more loved truth for its own sake; few have sacrificed more rather than violate their consciences, and this at a time when a high standard in this respect was not common. In spite of his failings, few have had warmer friends; no one more willingly communicated his knowledge and gave help to others; scarcely a book appeared in his time or for some years after his death on the subjects to which he devoted his life without acknowledging assistance from him. And, if it be remembered that his life was a continued struggle against poverty and slight and ill-health, rather than complain that he did little, we should wonder how he accomplished so much.


His library was divided into two parts, one of which was sold by auction; the other, containing the transcript of the Gale Photius, his books with his notes, and some letters from foreign scholars, was bought by Trinity College for 1000 guineas. His notebooks were found to contain, in the words of Bishop Blomfield, 
 a rich treasure of criticism in every branch of classical literature everything carefully and correctly written and sometimes rewritten quite fit to meet the public eye, without any diminution or addition.  
They have been carefully rearranged, and illustrate among other things his extraordinary penmanship and power of minute and accurate writing. Much remains unpublished. 














J. H. Monk













, his successor as Greek professor, and 











C. J. Blomfield










 (both afterwards bishops) edited the Adversaria, consisting of the notes on Athenaeus and the Greek poets, and his prelection on Euripides; 





PP Dobree




, afterwards Greek professor, the notes on Aristophanes and the lexicon of Photius. Besides these, from other sources, Professor 







T Gaisford






 edited his notes on 







Pausanias






 and Suidas, and Mr Kidd collected his scattered reviews. And, when Bishop Burgess attacked his literary character on the score of his Letters to Travis, Professor Turton (afterwards Bishop of Ely) came forward with a vindication.


The dates of Porson's published works are as follows:



Notae in Xenophontis anabasin (1786);


Appendix to Toup (1790);


Letters to Travis (1790);


Aeschylus (1795, 1806);


Euripides (1797 1802);

Notae in Pausaniam (Gaisford, 1820);


Photii lexicon (Dobree, 1822);


Notae in Suidam (Gaisford, 1834);


Correspondence (
H. R. Luard, edited for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society, 1867). 




Dr. Turton's vindication appeared in 1827.

Abdullah el-Faisal (born c. 1964) is a controversial 
Muslim preacher most known for being convicted for practicing 
hate speech.



Biography


El-Faisal was born in 





Saint James Parish




, 











Jamaica










 as Trevor William Forest to a 
Salvation Army family of practicing 
Christians.1 At the age of 16, el-Faisal converted to 
Islam,2 after being introduced to the religion by a high school teacher.1 El-Faisal studied at an Islamic institution in 







Guyana






, after which he traveled to the UK. El-Faisal trained in Islamic studies in 

Saudi Arabia
 for seven years.1 


El-Faisal returned to the 











United Kingdom










 in 1992, married a British 
biology graduate, and became a preacher at the 

Brixton
 mosque.3 El-Faisal often preached to crowds of up to 500 people.3 Referred to as  
Sheikh ,4 el-Faisal gave lectures to study groups all throughout the 











United Kingdom










.2 These lectures were taped and sold at specialist bookshops.2  El-Faisal has also traveled throughout 

Nigeria
 giving lectures. 




Controversy




He has also been associated with the Brixton 
Mosque, in south 

London
 but was ousted from Brixton Mosque by its 
Salafi administration in 1993, due to el-Faisal's increasing extremism. After el-Faisal's expulsion from Brixton Mosque he began to go even more extreme and this culminated in his lecture The Devil's Deception of the Saudi Salafis in 1996 wherein he pours scorn on the 
Salafi Muslims (of Brixton Mosque in particular) and makes 
takfir of the Salafis. Within the lecture, which can still be found on 
Jihadi websites to this day along with other lectures from el-Faisal, el-Faisal says about the Salafis that  ...they are hypocrites....the worst...not to be prayed behind. 5 El-Faisal according to his own testimony left the Brixton area in 1993.6 El-Faisal in a lecture in the late 1990s entitled The Devil's Deception of the 21st Century House Niggers makes 
takfir of African-American Salafi preacher 
Abu Usamah and calls for his assassination.7 
El-Faisal was jailed for 9 years for urging his audience to kill 


Jew

s, 
Hindus and 








Americans







.4 


In May 2007 the 

Home Secretary
 announced that he had been 
deported.8
In a recent 45 minute interview on a Jamaican TV programme entitled Religious Hardtalk in November 2007, el-Faisal described 9/11 and 7/7 as immoral and condemned suicide bombings.9

 in 2003, el-Faisal was found guilty by a jury of six men and six women of three charges of soliciting the murder of Jews, Americans, and Hindus, and two charges of using threatening words to stir up racial hatred. His taped lectures formed the basis of the prosecution case against him. During the trial he denied he had intended to incite people to violence and testified that he had held Osama Bin Laden in  great respect  but that Bin Laden had  lost the path  since September 11.

HRH Princess Alice, Duchess of GloucesterHRH The Duchess of GloucesterLady Alice Montagu-Douglas-Scott











House of Windsor
















The Duchess of Gloucester and her husband on an Australian stamp in 1945.



Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester (born The Lady Alice Christabel Montagu-Douglas-Scott; 25 December 1901   29 October 2004) was the wife of 

Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester
, the third son of 


George V

 and 


Queen Mary

. She was thus the 
sister-in-law of 


George VI

 and 


Edward VIII

, and the mother of the current 


Duke of Gloucester

. She was an aunt of 


Queen Elizabeth II

 through her marriage to the Queen's paternal uncle.


Early life


Lady Alice was born, in 



Montagu House


, 

London
, on 
Christmas Day 1901 as the third daughter of 


John Montagu-Douglas-Scott, Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry

, and his wife, the former Lady Margaret Bridgeman. She is therefore a descendant, in an unbroken male (though illegitimate) line, of 


Charles II

. She spent much of her childhood in her family's country homes: 
Boughton House in 

Northamptonshire
, 
Drumlanrig Castle in 
Dumfries and Galloway, and 
Bowhill in the Scottish Borders. She attended St James's boarding school, 





West Malvern




, 

Worcestershire
 and later travelled to 

France
 and 

Kenya
.  The Duchess' niece, 


Princess Alexandra of Kent

, who was likewise born on Christmas Day, shares the name Christabel in honour of their shared birthdate. The Duchess is also a first cousin of Lady Marian Louisa Montagu-Douglas-Scott, the grandmother of Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York by her marriage with Prince Andrew, duke of York.




Marriage


In August 1935, Lady Alice became engaged to 

Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester
, third son of George V. They were married in a private ceremony, in the chapel of 

Buckingham Palace
, on 
November 6 of that year. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester initially lived at 

Aldershot
, where the Duke was taking the Army staff course. The Duke of Gloucester left the army to take on more public duties following the abdication of 


Edward VIII

 in December 1936. In 1935, she took a trip to open the new grounds of 
The Lady Eleanor Holles School.


The couple received a 
grace and favour residence at York House, 
St James's Palace, London and, in 1938, they purchased 





Barnwell Manor




 in Northamptonshire. The Duke and Duchess had two sons:





Prince William of Gloucester
 (18 December 1941   28 August 1972)





Prince Richard of Gloucester

 (born 26 August 1944)




The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester travelled extensively to perform their royal duties. During 







World War II






, the Duchess worked with the 
Red Cross and the 

Order of St. John
. She became head of the 


Women's Royal Air Force

 (WRAF) in 1940, was given the honorary title of Air Chief Commandant WRAF in 1945 and promoted to 









Air Chief Marshal








 in the Royal Air Force in 1990. She also served as deputy to Queen Elizabeth, the consort of 


George VI

 as Commandant-in-Chief of the Nursing Corps. From 1945 to 1947, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester lived in 

Canberra
, where the Duke was serving as 
Governor General of Australia. The Duchess of Gloucester served as 
Colonel-in-Chief or deputy Colonel-in-Chief of a dozen regiments in the 
British Army, including the 

King's Own Scottish Borderers
, the 

Northamptonshire Regiment
, the 



2nd East Anglian Regiment


 (Duchess of Gloucester's Own Royal Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire), 
the Royal Anglian Regiment, the 



Royal Hussars


, and the 

Royal Irish Rangers
 (27th Inniskilling). She was also the Chancellor of the 

University of Derby
 and Patron of the 
 Girls' Day School Trust.




Change of Title



On 10 June 1974, Prince Henry died and was succeeded as Duke of Gloucester by their second son, 


Prince Richard

 (The couple's elder son and heir, Prince William, had been killed in an aeroplane crash in 1972). The Duke's widow requested permission from her niece, The Queen, to use the title and style HRH Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester instead of HRH The Dowager Duchess of Gloucester. The Queen allowed her aunt to adopt this title, in part to avoid confusion with her daughter-in-law, the new 


Duchess of Gloucester

 (formerly Brigitte Eva Van Deurs). Princess Alice also apparently did not wish to be known as a Dowager Duchess and so followed the example of her late sister-in-law, 
Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, following the marriage of her elder son in June 1961. However, Princess Marina was a Princess-by-birth. The de facto Dowager Duchess of Gloucester was allowed to be known as Princess Alice as a courtesy from the Queen. Although not specifically created a Princess by 
letters patent, the Princess was entitled to style herself as a British Princess, even though she was not born a British Princess.

Later life


In 1975, Princess Alice was the first lady to be appointed a 
Dame Grand Cross of the 
Order of the Bath. In 1981, she first published her memoirs under the title The Memoirs of Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester. In 1991, she released a revised edition as Memories of Ninety Years. 


In 1994, after the Gloucesters had to give up Barnwell Manor because of financial reasons, Princess Alice moved from Barnwell to 








Kensington Palace







, where she lived with the current Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. In 1999, the Duke of Gloucester issued a press release announcing that due to physical frailty, his mother would no longer carry out public engagements outside the environs of Kensington Palace. 


In December 2001, the Royal Family held a ceremony to acknowledge Princess Alice s centennial birthday. This was Princess Alice's last public appearance (and also the last public appearance of 

Princess Margaret
, the Queen's sister). On 24 July 2003, Princess Alice succeeded 
Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, as the oldest ever living member of the British Royal Family - a feat which is yet to be surpassed.


Princess Alice died on 29 October 2004 in her sleep at Kensington Palace, at the age of 102. Her funeral was held on 5 November 2004, at 
St. George's Chapel, 








Windsor Castle







, and she was interred next to her husband, Prince Henry, and her elder son, Prince William, in the 











Royal Burial Ground










 at 




Frogmore



. The Funeral was attended by The Queen and other members of the Royal Family. A memorial service was held at 

St. Clement Danes
, on 2 February 2005.

History of astrology
Divination




 Geomancer  redirects here. For other uses, see 
Geomancer (disambiguation). 


Geomancy (from 

Greek
 ge manteia geo,  earth  + manteia,  divination ), from the eponymous ilm al-raml ( the science of sand ), is a method of 
divination that interprets markings on the ground, or how handfuls of 
soil, 
dirt or 
sand land when someone tosses them. The 
Arabic tradition consists of sketching sixteen random lines of dots in 
sand. 


In 






Africa





 one traditional form of geomancy consists of throwing handfuls of dirt in the air and observing how the dirt falls. It can also involve a mouse as the agent of the earth spirit. 
Ifa, one of the oldest forms of geomancy, originated in West Africa. In China, the diviner may enter a trance and make markings on the ground that are interpreted by an associate (often a young boy).


In 

Korea
, this tradition was popularized in the ninth century by the Buddhist monk Toson.  In Korea, Geomancy takes the form of interpreting the topography of the land to determine future events and or the strength of a dynasty or particular family.  Therefore, not only were location and land forms important, but the topography could shift causing disfavor and the need to relocate.  The idea is still accepted in many South East Asian societies today, although with reduced force.1


Geomancy formed part of the required study of the 
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the late 19th century, and also survives in modern occult practice.


In the 19th century CE, 
Christian missionaries in 
China translated 
Feng Shui as geomancy, but this was incorrect. 


In recent times the term has been applied to a wide range of other occult, fringe, and 
pseudoscientific activities, including 
Bau-Biologie.  This article deals with geomancy in its traditional meaning.



 Literary background 


The poem Experimentarius attributed to 
Bernardus Silvestris (Bernard Silvester), who wrote in the middle of the 12th century, was a verse translation of a work on astrological geomancy. 


Either 














Gerard of Cremona













 (c. 1114 87) or Gerard of Sabionetta (Sabloneta), who lived in the thirteenth century, wrote or translated Astronomical Geomancy from Arabic into Latin. An original in Arabic is possible, as the traditional method of structuring a geomantic divination follows the direction of Arabic writing. There has been disagreement among scholars over which of these two men was responsible for this text.


According to the 









Oxford English Dictionary








,  geomancy  appeared in vernacular 

English
 in 
1362 (vernacular English at this time was the language of the lowest classes; 

Latin
 and 

French
 were the common languages of the middle class, gentry, and nobles). 


Geomancy's first mention in print was Langland's Piers Plowman where it is unfavorably compared to the level of expertise a person needs for astronomy ( gemensye [geomesye] is gynful of speche ). In 1386 




Chaucer



 used the Parson's Tale to poke fun at geomancy in 
Canterbury Tales:  What say we of them that believe in divynailes as  geomancie   
Shakespeare also used geomancy for comic relief. 


It was explained as divination (in the same sentence with 
pyromancy and 
hydromancy) in the best-selling 
Travels of Sir John Mandeville (1400, ISBN 0-14-044435-1), as  geomantie that superstitious arte  in a book of alchemy (1477), and defined in 
















Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa















's Philosophy of Natural Magic: Complete Work on Natural Magic, White   Black Magic (1569, ISBN 1-56459-160-3) as a form of divination  which doth divine by certaine conjectures taken of similitudes of the cracking of the Earthe.  European geomancy does owe some of its valuations to medieval astrology (the  houses  for example).


In 





Ben Jonson




's Elizabethan comedy 




The Alchemist



, the character Abel Drugger is a practitioner of geomancy.


In the story of Aladdin often included in  The Arabian Nights  called  The History of Aladdin  both the African Magician and his brother use geomancy to find Aladdin to do him harm.2




 Western methodology 


Geomancy in western tradition requires no instruments and no calculations; it is based solely on the human propensity for pattern recognition. 


Diviners in medieval Europe used parchment or paper for drawing the dots of geomancy but they followed the traditional direction of notation  (right to left) for recording the dots. Western 
occultism  still defines geomantic technique as marking 
sixteen lines of dashes in sand or soil with a wand or on a sheet of paper. The dashes aren't counted as they are made (thus constituting a form of spontaneous divination).


The geomancer counts the number of dashes made in each line and draws either a single dot (for an odd number) or two dots (for an even number) next to the lines. The pattern of dots produced by the first to fourth lines are known as a figure, as are the fifth to eighth lines and so on.


Those four figures are entered into two charts, known as the Shield and House charts, and through  processes form the seed of the figures that fill the whole charts. The charts are subsequently analyzed and interpreted by the geomancer to find solutions, options and responses to the problem quesited, along with general information about the geomancer (unless the geomancer is performing the divination for another, in which case information is shown about the person the charts were cast for) providing an all-round reading into the questioner's life.


This form of Geomancy is easy to learn and easy to perform. Once practiced by commoners and rulers alike, it was one of the most popular forms of divination throughout the 
Middle Ages.


The 
four binary 


elements

 of each figure allow for 16 different combinations. As there are 4 root figures in each chart, the total number of possible charts equals 16 16 16 16, or 65536. The charts are also interpreted differently depending on the nature of the question, making it one of the most thorough kinds of divination available, and with only 16 figures to understand is extremely simple.


Unique Geomantic Shields


Out of the 65536 possible permutations of the classical geomantic shield some are extremely useful from a mathematical and qabalist point of view.  This is because some of the shields contain all of the 16 geomantic figures only once in each case, and these may be termed as 'Unique Geomantic Shields'.  In these cases the shield, which has fifteen different sections, has all of the figures except Populus.  Below is a table which shows the four 'Mothers' needed to create the Unique Geomantic Shields.  For the method of how to create the configurations from the four 'Mothers', perhaps the best online source is Crowley's Liber 96 available most reliably from hermetic.com.  (At the risk of sounding utterly unprofessional I must admit that I am only aware of 16 such permutations, and that there is a slight probability that more exist.)

Geomantic Magic Square (Qemea)


A Magic Square is traditionally a set of inclusive integers laid out in a square grid so that the sums of the columns, rows and central diagonals are equal.  The arrangement below could be loosely described as a Qemea, but it is certainly a Magic Square of sorts.  When one counts up the dots on the figures we find the number 24 cropping up all over the place: the four columns, the four rows, the two central diagonals, the four central squares, the outer four squares, and also the fours sets of four squares each if we look at the configuration as four squares.

Astrological geomancy


Because traditional Western geomantic divination was so dependent on astrological technique, it was often referred to as astrological geomancy. 
Although documents from the 12th century explain the theories and methodologies of this type of geomancy, it was more recently popularized by occultist 













Franz Hartmann












 in his book The Principles of Astrological Geomancy.

Divination, Geomancy, fractals and modern computers 


Mathematician 

Ron Eglash
, while studying fractal structures in African culture, identified a binary recursive process that used self similarity to create a random number generator from an initial set of lines that the geomancer draws on the ground. This technique was brought to Europe by way of North African Islamic mystics.  It is very likely that these mystics had previously obtained the approach from traditional African societies by way of interactions between the West African and North African trade and/or Islamic kingdoms.  For, unlike the practices in many other regions (i.e. the Middle East and China etc.) which utilized base 10 numeric systems, the base 2 system utilized in geomancy had long been widely applied in sub-Saharan Africa.  Partly inspired by the geomantic technique, Gottfried Leibniz, a German mathematician, developed the binary code theory, which later was the base for Boolean algebra and modern computers.   3

Template metaprogramming is a 
metaprogramming technique in which 




templates



 are used by a 
compiler to generate temporary source code, which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled. The output of these templates include compile-time constants, data structures, and complete functions. The use of templates can be thought of as 
compile-time execution. The technique is used by a number of languages, the most well-known being 

C++
, but also 
Curl, 
D, 

Eiffel
, 

Haskell
, 
ML and 
XL.


 Components of template metaprogramming 


The use of templates as a metaprogramming technique requires two distinct operations: a template must be defined, and a defined template must be instantiated. The template definition describes the generic form of the generated source code, and the instantiation causes a specific set of source code to be generated from the generic form in the template.


Template metaprogramming is generally 
Turing-complete, meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a template metaprogram. 


Templates are different from 


macros

. A macro, which is also a compile-time language feature, generates code in-line using text manipulation and substitution. Macro systems often have limited compile-time process flow abilities and usually lack awareness of the semantics and type system of their companion language (an exception should be made with 

Lisp
's macros, which are written in Lisp itself, and is not a simple text manipulation and substitution).


Template metaprograms have no 
mutable variables  that is, no variable can change value once it has been initialized, therefore template metaprogramming can be seen as a form of 




functional programming



. In fact many template implementations only implement flow control through recursion, as seen in the example below.




 Using template metaprogramming 


Though the syntax of template metaprogramming is usually very different from the programming language it is used with, it has practical uses. Some common reasons to use templates are to implement 
generic programming (avoiding sections of code which are similar except for some minor variations) or to perform automatic compile-time optimization such as doing something once at compile time rather than every time the program is run   for instance, by having the compiler unroll loops to eliminate jumps and loop count decrements whenever the program is executed.



 Compile-time class generation 


What exactly  programming at compile-time  means can be illustrated with an example of a 
factorial function, which in non-templated C++ can be written using recursion as follows:


int factorial(int n) 
{
if (n == 0)
return 1;
return n * factorial(n - 1);
}


void foo()
{
int x = factorial(4); // == (4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1) == 24
int y = factorial(0); // == 0! == 1
}


The code above will execute when the program is run to determine the factorial value of the literals 4 and 0.


Instead, by using template metaprogramming and template specialization to provide the ending condition for the recursion, the factorials used in the program, ignoring any factorial not used, can be calculated at compile-time by


template 
struct Factorial 
{
enum { value = N * Factorial::value };
};


template  gt;
struct Factorial0 gt; 
{
enum { value = 1 };
};


// Factorial4 gt;::value == 24
// Factorial0 gt;::value == 1
void foo()
{
int x = Factorial4 gt;::value; // == 24
int y = Factorial0 gt;::value; // == 1
}



The code above calculates the factorial value of the literals 4 and 0 at compile time and uses the result as if they were precalculated constants.


While the two versions are similar from the point of view of the program's functionality, the first example calculates the factorials at run time, while the second calculates them at compile time. However, to be able to use templates in this manner, the compiler must know the value of its parameters at compile time, which has the natural precondition that FactorialX gt;::value can only be used if X is known at compile time. In other words, X must be a constant literal or a constant expression, such as using 
sizeof operator.




 Compile-time code optimization 


The factorial example above is one example of compile-time code optimization in that all factorials used by the program are pre-compiled and injected as numeric constants at compilation, saving both run-time overhead and memory footprint. It is, however, a relatively minor optimisation.


As another, more significant, example of compile-time loop-unrolling, templated metaprogramming can be used to create n-dimensional vector classes (where n is known at compile time). The benefit over a more traditional n-dimensional vector is that the loops can be unrolled, resulting in very optimized code. As an example, consider the addition operator. An n-dimensional vector addition might be written as


template 
Vector  Vector::operator+=(const Vector  rhs) 
{
for (int i = 0; i  dimension; ++i)
value[i] += rhs.value[i];
return *this;
}



When the compiler instantiates the templated function defined above, the following code will be produced:



template  gt;
Vector2 gt;  Vector2 gt;::operator+=(const Vector2 gt;  rhs) 
{
value[0] += rhs.value[0];
value[1] += rhs.value[1];
return *this;
}



The compiler's optimizer is able to unroll the for loop because the template parameter dimension is a constant at compile time.




 Static polymorphism 



Polymorphism is a common standard programming facility where derived objects can be used as instances of their base object but where the derived objects' methods will be invoked, as in this code


class Base
{
public:
virtual void method() { std::cout   Base ; }
};


class Derived : public Base
{
public:
virtual void method() { std::cout   Derived ; }
};


int main()
{
Base *pBase = new Derived;
pBase- gt;method(); //outputs  Derived 
delete pBase;
return 0;
}


where all invocations of virtual methods will be those of the most-derived class. This dynamically polymorphic behaviour is obtained by the creation of 
virtual look-up tables for classes with virtual methods, tables that are traversed at run time to identify the method to be invoked. Thus, run-time polymorphism necessarily entails execution overhead. 


However, in many cases the polymorphic behaviour needed is invariant and can be determined at compile time. Then the 
Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) can be used to achieve static polymorphism, which is an imitation of polymorphism in programming code but which is resolved at compile time and thus does away with run-time virtual-table lookups. For example: 


template 
struct base
{
void interface()
{
// ...
static_cast(this)- gt;implementation();
// ...
}
};


struct derived : base
{
void implementation();
};


Here the base class template will take advantage of the fact that member function bodies are not instantiated until after their declarations, and it will use members of the derived class within its own member functions, via the use of a static_cast, thus at compilation generating an object composition with polymorphic characteristics. As an example of real-world usage, the CRTP is used in the 
Boost 
iterator library 
http://www.boost.org/libs/iterator/doc/iterator_facade.html.


Another similar use is the  




Barton-Nackman trick



 , sometimes referred to as  restricted template expansion , where common functionality can be placed in a base class that is used not as a contract but as a necessary component to enforce conformant behaviour while minimising code redundancy.





 Benefits and drawbacks of template metaprogramming 





 Compile-time versus execution-time tradeoff: Since all templated code is processed, evaluated and expanded at compile-time, compilation will take longer while the executable code may be more efficient. This overhead is generally small, but for large projects, or projects relying pervasively on templates, it may be significant.


 Generic programming: Template metaprogramming allows the programmer to focus on architecture and delegate to the compiler the generation of any implementation required by client code. Thus, template metaprogramming can accomplish truly generic code, facilitating code minimization and better maintainability.


 Readability: With respect to C++, the syntax and idioms of template metaprogramming are esoteric compared to conventional C++ programming, and advanced, or even most non-trivial, template metaprogramming can be very difficult to understand. Metaprograms can thus be difficult to maintain by programmers inexperienced in template metaprogramming (though this may vary with the language's implementation of template metaprogramming syntax).


 Portability: With respect to C++, due to differences in compilers, code relying heavily on template metaprogramming (especially the newest forms of metaprogramming) might have portability issues.

Straits of Canada
Landforms of Prince Edward Island
Landforms of Nova Scotia
Landforms of New Brunswick




The Northumberland Strait (French: detroit de Northumberland) is a 
strait in the southern part of the 



Gulf of Saint Lawrence


 in eastern 

Canada
.  The strait is formed by 

Prince Edward Island
 and the gulf's southern and western shores.



Northumberland Strait with 








MV Holiday Island







, 






Pictou Island





 in background





Boundaries


The western boundary of the strait is delineated by a line running between 
North Cape, Prince Edward Island and 
Point Escuminac, New Brunswick while the eastern boundary is delineated by a line running between 







East Point, Prince Edward Island






 and 
Cheticamp, Nova Scotia.




Water temperature


The strait's shallow depths lend to warm water temperatures in summer months, with some areas reaching 25  


C

, or 77  


F

.  Consequently the strait is reportedly home to the warmest ocean water temperatures in Canada, and some of the warmest ocean water temperatures on the Atlantic coast north of 

Virginia
.


During the winter months between December and April, 
sea ice covers the entire strait and Gulf of St. Lawrence.




Geomorphology


While the western shores of 




Cape Breton Island



 and northeastern shores of the 


Nova Scotia peninsula

 are dominated by 
granite, sedimentary rocks along the central and western parts of the strait, as well as the entire south shore of Prince Edward Island, consist of 
sandstone, lending to beautiful sandy beaches with minimal coastal development.  The largest island in the strait is 
Pictou Island.




Settlements


Major communities on the strait include the cities of 
Charlottetown and 

Summerside
, Prince Edward Island as well as the towns of 

Souris, Prince Edward Island
, 

Pictou, Nova Scotia
, and 
Shediac, New Brunswick.




Transportation








Shipping


The Northumberland Strait is a minor shipping route, with ports such as 

Pugwash
 shipping salt, Summerside, Charlottetown, Georgetown and Souris shipping agricultural products and receiving petroleum and aggregate, and Pictou shipping forestry products and general cargo.  Shipping has declined in recent decades with the decline of rail service to ports and the increased capacity of highways to larger ports outside of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which freezes in the winter.




Confederation Bridge


The narrowest part of the strait, the 13-kilometre (7 nautical mile) wide 
Abegweit Passage in the western part of the strait between 

Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island
 and 







Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick






, is now spanned by the 

Confederation Bridge
.




Ferries


The strait hosts two seasonal ferry services: 

Northumberland Ferries Limited
 operates a passenger/vehicle service between 




Caribou, Nova Scotia



 and 




Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island



, a separate passenger-only ferry service also operates from Caribou to Pictou Island. The other passenger/vehicle service is located between Souris, Prince Edward Island and Iles de la Madeleine, Quebec. Both services are located at the eastern end of the strait.


There was a ferry service between Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island and Cape Tormentime, New Brunswick until 





May 31




, 
1997. It was one of Canada's busiest ferry services and was operated by 

Marine Atlantic
 across Abegweit Passage.  This service has been replaced by the Confederation Bridge.




Swim Crossings


There have been several documented unassisted swim crossings of the strait, although there is no official body to verify these claims.  There are only two documented single-day double crossings (~28km) to date:



 On July 26, 2007, Jennifer Alexander (who has 
Type 1 Diabetes) of 

Halifax
, swam a double crossing in 19 hours, 17 minutes 1.  


 On July 26, 2008, Kristin Roe, also of 

Halifax
, swam a double crossing, recorded at 40 km in 15 hours, 40 minutes for the Stephen Lewis Foundation and Farmers Helping Farmers 2.

Ben Folds
  







Robert Sledge






  








Darren Jessee













Ben Folds Five was a 
piano-based rock trio formed in 1993 in 










Chapel Hill









, 





North Carolina




. The group comprised 

Ben Folds
 on vocals, piano, and principal songwriting; 







Robert Sledge






 played 
bass and provided backing vocals; and 








Darren Jessee







 played 
drums, sang backing vocals and co-wrote some of the songs. The group achieved modest success in the 
alternative, 
indie and 
pop music scenes. The band is perhaps best known for the hit single,  




Brick



  from their 
1997 album 
Whatever and Ever Amen, which gained airplay on many mainstream radio stations.


Much of Ben Folds Five's work was influenced by 
jazz, evident in frequent 
improv-styled passages through bridge and/or ending.  During their seven years together, the band released three proper studio records, one 
retrospective album of 
B-sides   outtakes, and eight singles. They also contributed to a number of soundtracks and compilations. Ben Folds Five disbanded in October 
2000, apparently under amicable circumstances.


The group reunited for a one-off concert on 
September 18, 
2008, where they played their final album, 

The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner
, in its entirety.1



History


Ben Folds Five was formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill by Ben Folds.  They were, in fact, a trio in spite of their name, and the primary motivation behind the name, apart from the band's well-known use of humor, was simple preference, according to Ben:  I think it sounds better than Ben Folds Three .2 
Folds once described their music as  punk rock for sissies , a reaction to the angst prevalent in 90s rock.3


Their first radio single was  Underground  from their 

self-titled debut album
, released in 1995 on Caroline records. The band's biggest success was the single  




Brick



  from their second album, 
Whatever and Ever Amen, released in 1997. It was followed by the more somber and jazz-based 1999 album, 

The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner
. Despite a more somber record in Reinhold Messner album, live shows continued to pack in the energy and improvisation that Ben Folds Five had grown to have quite a reputation for.  


The group contributed an outtake from the Reinhold Messner sessions, titled  Leather Jacket , to the 1999 benefit album, . The band's final recording was a cover of 



Steely Dan


's  Barrytown  for the 

Me, Myself   Irene
 soundtrack. Following the worldwide tour in support of The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messener, the band  amicably  broke up in October 2000.4



Post-break up


Folds went on to pursue a successful solo career, releasing 
Rockin the Suburbs in 2001, 


Songs for Silverman

 in 2005, and a new album, 

Way to Normal
, was released September 30, 2008. Robert Sledge soon after took up singing, shared song-writing and bass playing duties with 
International Orange, but the group disbanded in 2005. On September 13, 2008 the debut show of seemingly new project The BobSledge Band played at Mansion 462, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Darren Jessee went on to form the band 

Hotel Lights
, releasing their self-titled debut album in 2005 on 






Bar/None Records





, the Goodnightgoodmorning EP in 2006, and Firecracker People on August 19th, 2008. Darren is the songwriter/guitarist/piano player and the lead vocals of 

Hotel Lights
.




Reunion


Ben Folds Five made its first concert appearance in about 8 years on September 18, 2008 at the UNC Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill.1 The event was described by Triangle Music as the coming together of  the now legendary hometown group Ben Folds Five  which  reunited for a one-off show and the band's set was nothing short of spectacular. The one-off gig was part of the 

MySpace
  Front to Back  series, in which artists play an entire album live. The band played its final album, 

The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner
, and were briefly joined on stage by Ben's father, Dean Folds, who read a transcript of his voice mail message that is highlighted on the album song 'Your Most Valuable Possession.'5 The concert will be streamed online, airing sometime in October, on myspace.6 All proceeds from ticket sales will benefit the charity 

Operation Smile
.7After a brief Intermission, the band returned and played the following songs:


Jackson Cannery
Eddie Walker
Selfless, Cold, Composed
Battle of Who Could Care Less
Where's Summer B
Julianne
Song for the Dumped

Ions
Chemical compounds







The 
crystal structure of 
sodium chloride, NaCl, a typical ionic compound.  The purple spheres are 
sodium 
cations, Na+, and the green spheres are 
chloride 
anions, Cl .



In 
chemistry, an ionic compound is a 
chemical compound in which 
ions are held together in a lattice structure by 
ionic bonds. Usually, the positively charged portion consists of metal 
cations and the negatively charged portion is a 
halogen or polyatomic ion. Ions in ionic compounds are held together by the 
electrostatic force between oppositely charged bodies. Ionic compounds have a high melting and boiling point, and they have a high hardness and are very brittle.

Ions can be single atoms, as the 
sodium and 
chloride in common table salt 
sodium chloride, or more complex groups such as the 
carbonate in 
calcium carbonate. But to be considered an ion, they must carry a positive or negative charge. Thus, in an ionic bond, one 'bonder' must have a positive charge and the other a negative one.  By sticking to each other, they resolve, or partially resolve, their separate charge imbalances. Positive to positive and negative to negative ionic bonds do not occur. (For an easily visible analogy, experiment with a pair of bar 
magnets.)


Chemical compounds are never strictly ionic. Even the most 
electronegative/
electropositive pairs such as 
caesium fluoride exhibit a degree of covalency. Similarly, 
covalent compounds often exhibit charge separations. See also 
HSAB theory.

Characteristics


Ionic compounds have strong 
electrostatic bonds between particles. As a result, they generally have high melting and boiling points. They also have good electrical conductivity when molten or in aqueous solution. While ionic 
inorganic compounds are solids at room temperature and will usually form crystals, organic 
ionic liquids are of increasing interest.




Solubility


Following the aphorism,  like dissolves like , ionic compounds dissolve in 
polar solvents, especially those which ionize, such as water and 
ionic liquids. They are usually appreciably soluble in other polar solvents such as 
alcohols, 
acetone and 
dimethyl sulfoxide as well. Ionic compounds tend not to dissolve in 
nonpolar solvents such as 
diethyl ether or 
petrol (gasoline).




Nomenclature


According to the 
IUPAC, an ionic compound's common name is written using two words. The name of the cation comes first (when using the 
Stock system) with the 
oxidation number written in parenthesis, followed by the name of the anion. For example, Fe2(SO4)3 is named as iron(III) sulfate. If the Classical naming system is being used, some ionic compounds have special  old  names, such as ferric (iron(III)), ferrous (iron(II)), cupric (copper(II)), and cuprous (copper(I)).

Hemimorphite, is a 
sorosilicate 
mineral which has been mined from days of old from the upper parts of 
zinc and 
lead 
ores, chiefly associated with 
smithsonite. It was often assumed to be the same mineral and both were classed under the same name of 
calamine. In the second half of the 18th century it was discovered that there were two different minerals under the heading of calamine - a zinc 
carbonate and a zinc silicate, which often closely resembled each other.


The silicate was the more rare of the two, and was named hemimorphite  because of the hemimorph development of its 
crystals. This unusual form, which is typical of only a few minerals, means that the crystals are terminated by dissimilar faces. Hemimorphite most commonly forms crystalline crusts and layers, also massive, granular, rounded and reniform aggregates, concentrically striated, or finely needle-shaped, fibrous or stalactitic, and rarely fan-shaped clusters of crystals.


Some specimens show strong green 
fluorescence in shortwave 
ultraviolet light (253.7 nm) and weak light pink fluorescence in longwave UV. 



Occurrence


Hemimorphite most frequently occurs as the product of the 
oxidation of the upper parts of 
sphalerite bearing ore bodies, accompanied by other secondary minerals which form the so-called iron cap or 
gossan. Hemimorphite is an important 
ore of zinc and contains up to 54.2% of the metal.

Towed water sports




Wakeskating is a new watersport and is an adaptation of 
wakeboarding that employs a similar design of board manufactured from maple or from 
fibreglass. Unlike wakeboarding, the rider is not bound to the board in any way, which gives the sport its own unique challenges. Instead, the top surface of the board is covered with griptape, (in a similar fashion to a 
skateboard) or a soft, high-traction, foam covering that is kinder to riders in the inevitable crashes. Riders usually wear shoes while riding to afford themselves extra purchase on the board, similar to skateboarding.

Some of the earliest riding to resemble wakeskating dates back to the late 70s and early 80s with  freeboarding  or  wakesurfing.   Originally, riders would surf behind boats with long boards, but eventually the evolution leaned towards boards that were much shorter (ex:4'8) which allowed riders to launch airs off the wake and even ollie.  However, the watersports industry leaned strongly towards bindings, resulting in the focused evolution of wakeboarding.  Wakeskating would eventually begin to take notice in the mid 90s, and the growth continued. It is increasingly popular in youth culture across the globe, but is prevalent mainly in its country of origin; the 








United States







. An aspect of wakeskating that draws many aficionados to it, as opposed to wakeboarding, is progression without the need for the large and extremely expensive boats (necessary to create the wake for wakeboarders to achieve maximum air time). An alternative to using wakeboard boats to tow riders is using high powered jet skis.  This method of watercraft can provide an adequate tow, however, produce little or no wake. Jetskis are better for shallow water or where water obstacles are available to perform tricks on.


Wakeskating tricks are inherently more technical than wakeboarding. The tricks are based firmly on skateboarding as opposed to snowboarding. Numerous tournaments and competitions exist throughout the world for the sport of wakeskating.


Smaller Rider Owned Companies have started to make their mark on the sport of wakeskating, such as Cassette, New, 
Oak Wakeskates, 
Sattelyte Wakeskates, and 
Integrity.


New materials and assembly techniques are continually introduced into the sport of wakeskating.  Traditional boards are made of plywood or fiberglass, but a new technology has come out called Tri-Ax Fiberglass reinforcing.  A woven fiberglass top sheet is applied.  This process helps the board to be more rigid and increases the life of the board.1 


One type of board is a bi-level wakeskate. The bi-level was first used on a wakeskate by one of the forefathers of wakeskating, Thomas Horrell.  It is basically two boards usually made of plywood and/or fiberglass connected in the middle by two brackets.  The point of having a bi-level board is that the flex in the top board helps accelerate the board from the water, which allows the board to stay with your feet and also feel more like an ollie on a skateboard.


The other type of board is a Concave deck, usually either compression molded out of fiberglass, or a wood core deck. Compression molded wakeskates are less dense than wood core wakeskates, which is one factor that will cause a board to sit higher in the water (along with rail shape--a sharper rail will make the board sit higher and ride with a high response level; round rails allow a board to sit deeper in the water). Conversely, wood core decks tend to be a tad bit heavier, and are more dense, which make them favored by most wakeskaters. They state that the wood core deck feels more like a skateboard and is easier to control/feel.


Wakeskates usually size between 100-114 cm (roughly 39-45 inches), which is considerably smaller than a wakeboard. Rail shape can vary from a more rounded shape, which is common on most wood skates, to a sharper rail, which was traditionally found on compression molded decks, and a resurgence in the variable edge, which means the rail will be rounded in the middle and sharp on the edges.  Today, a variable edge can be found on numerous wakeskates, since it allows for forgiveness on rails and lip tricks, but also allows you a sharp edge for cutting into the wake.


Wakeskates are manufactured by many of the same companies that produce wakeboards such as CWB, Hyperlite, and Liquid force, along with many Wakeskate specific companies such as Integrity, Oak, Sattalyte, and New.  However, going back into wakeskating's roots, the first company dedicated specifically to wakeskating was called Fresh Water Traction.  Fresh Water Traction (abbreviated as FWT) was the first company to produce any product specifically for wakeskating.  Their first products began as traction pads, which are foam constructions one could attach to their wakeboard via the inserts one would normally use for bindings.  This allowed for riders to try the art of wakeskating without having to commit to cutting up their wakeboard or attaching something that could also be removed.  Later, Fresh Water also came out with the first wakeskate specific fin.  This fin was shallow and long and allowed for the board to release much easier than most wakeboarding fins at the time.  Towards the end, Fresh Water attempted to release a wakeskate to the public, but cost was a major hurdle that could not be over come.


Soon before Fresh Water Traction ceased production, a small rider owned company named Cassette entered the market in 1999.  In an interview with WakeBoarding magazine in 1999, Thomas Horrell aluded to the idea of a wakeskate specific company:  Some day soon there will be an all wakeskate company, and it's going to be a totally different thing; it's going to be sick.  People will triple-take on it; it's going to be massive and people won't know what to think.   Early on, Cassette was run independently, but soon after the brand was licensed to Liquid Force.  Once Liquid Force filed for bankruptcy, their working contract with Cassette became void, resulting in Cassette separating from Liquid Force in 2003 and not 99-00 as previously stated.  In the realm of board production and design, Cassette began by producing flat decks, but by 2002 they had introduced the first concave wakeskate to the market.  2003 brought about the influential and legendary 4-trac, along with a wakeskate-specific fin that allowed for not only nose slides, but bluntslides and mannual variations.  2005 brought the world of wakeskating its first bi-level.  


In addition to Cassette's contribution to advancing wakeskate designs, they also produced and captured some of wakeskating's most influential films, allowing them to portray wakeskating and push it in the best direction they saw fit. Cassette not only produced wakeskating's first  team videos  but also the first film dedicated entirely to wakeskating, which is titled Linear Perspective 2001's and 2003's Sfumato.


Cassette founder, Thomas Horrell is widely respected from his influence on wakeskating and his contribution to its progression. Although the company is currently defunt, Cassette Wakeskates are still sought after for both riding entertainment as well as historical value. Horrell still lurks, putting out stand up video parts and pushing the sport. 


WakeBoarding Magazine, 1999:  The wakeskating thing has just started.  Messer and his whole scheme has just started to unfold as he thought.  He's totally right on when it comes to that.  It's going to be huge and totally break through all of the barriers that have been up against wakeboarding in the last three or four years. --Thomas Horrell



Board materials


For the most part there are going to be two main board materials. First you have the wood deck. wood is used to make flat decks, concave decks and Bi-Levels.  Composite, the other type. of The two materials both have a different feel in the water.  If you want a light weight board then you should get a composite board or fiberglass board.




Fin Technology


Fins are constructed with three different kinds of materials.  The first and original fin material to wakeskating is plastic.  This material will bend and crack if it is exposed to the right conditions.  When the fin breaks and bends, it loses its performance.  Plastic fins can only be molded down to .5 inches in width.  Several materials fin manufacturers use are fiberglass and aluminum.  Due to the fact that they are hand molded or machined they can be much narrower.  The narrow fins will cut down on drag in the water.  Aluminum fins are heavier and cost more, but they hold up to the beating that wakeskating can give them.  Fiberglass fins are cheaper than aluminum fins, but in time they chip apart.  They don t weigh as much as aluminum fins either.2


The length of the fin on your board can vary greatly.  Some fins are 5-8.5 inches long.  The longer fins are good because, they don t have to be as long to get the same surface area in the water.  They will track better than a fin that is shorter.  Also the long fins work better on rails and ramps because, they are short enough that they will not make a lot of contact with the rail and ramp.  Shorter fins must be taller to get the same amount of tracking.2


A shallower fin will not track as good as a deeper one.  But a deeper fin will have more drag in the water, and it will not release off the wake as fast.2


It is somewhat of a trend for wake skaters to ride with no fins.




Getting Up


Deepwater Start

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Cabin_and_lake_054.jpg


There are a variety of techniques for getting up on a wakeskate, but they all follow the same basic rules.  Orient your body vertical in the water with the board deck under your feet.  When the boat starts to pull forward, you will want to bring your feet and the board up in front of you.  The pressure of the oncoming water should force the board to stick to your feet.  Straighten your arms so that when the boat takes off you will not hurt your arms from the jolt.  Your knees should be bent so that you can keep your center of gravity low.  If your center of gravity is too high, then you would be pulled over your feet.  When you have done all of the previously stated requirements, tell the boat driver to start going.  When the boat starts to move, the water will push on the bottom of the wakeskate, forcing your upper body to rise up out of the water.  In reality, the boat does the work for you.  If you try to muscle your way through things, and force yourself to get up, you will end up getting your arms jerked.  Getting up on a wakeskate is the exact same procedure you use to get up on a wakeboard.  The only difference is, is that your feet are not connected with bindings.  The pressure from the boat will force the board to be stuck to your feet, therefore it will make it easier to get up.  It is found that it is most easy to get up on a wakeskate when the pulling rope is pulled tightly before the boat takes off.    When you have gotten up, turn the board so that it is parallel with the boat, and turn your upper body so that it is perpendicular with the boat.3


Dock Start
Instead of doing a deepwater start, you can perform a dock start.  A dock start is when you jump off of a dock and position a wakeskate under your feet with the rope handle in your hand. It is similar to an acid drop in skateboarding. The hard part about this is your timing and positioning of the wakeskate beneath your feet.  When you land in the water you must bend your knees, otherwise the board will slip out from under you.  The hard part about this is your timing and positioning of the wakeskate.3


Once You're Up
Jumping from one side of the wake to the other is called wake-to-wake air.  The first thing that you must do is edge out to the right or the left, as far as you can.  Come back about half way to the wake, and then progressively edge toward the wake.  Edging is when you use the edge of the board to turn.  When you hit the wake, your legs should be rigid, so that they do not absorb the wake.  If you do not do this, you will not get any pop off the wake.  Pop enables you to get into the air.  Upon take-off, your front leg should be higher than your back leg, so that when the board is in the air, the wind will push the board against your feet.  Immediately tuck your feet and knees up.  The board will follow.  If you get high enough and far enough you will go from wake to wake.  The landing is also important.  Before you land on the other side of the wake, you need to extend your legs and push the board toward the water.  When you land you need to absorb the impact through your knees and keep your weight centered over your feet.3




Winching


Wakeskating, has in recent times become more and more urbanized due to the advent of the  winch . The winch is a mechanical device that holds a spool of rope and pulls the rope in at riding speed. This invention has given wakeskaters the opportunity to ride in places never imagined possible before. Making wakeskating more accessible than ever before. The original winch was the Re-wind winch was conceptualized Tony Robinson and Thomas Horrell in 2003.4 In recent times Released Winching co. has swept the winching industry with its light weight and durable aluminum frames and its innovative releasing spool which allows the spool to free spin while the rider pulls out the rope.  Winches however are not just a commercial endeavor, some people build their own using plans and forums such as 
winchskating.com. 


Those who construct the winch themselves can expect to spend about $800-1600 plus.  The main contributing factors of the price of the constructed winch are; the amount of horsepower the engine has, the age and condition of the engine, the length and quality of rope (generally people use anywhere from 200ft of rope to 700ft of rope), the quality of the materials used, such as the metal for the main structure, and another contributing factor in the price of the winch is if you do all the construction and assembly yourself.5


This progression has led to unique competitions such as Nokia Fise held in Montpellier, France.  The Nokia competition featured a  skatepark  like setup with rails, sliders, boxes, kickers and gaps for the wakeskaters to throw tricks and combinations on. But winching really isn't about competitions. It is about going out and riding on any body of water with your friends for fun without the use of a 30,000 boat that nobody in today's economy can afford besides rusty the bone crusher malinosky and the rest of the dub riding wakeboarders.




Shoes


The shoes that wakeskate riders wear are similar to skateboarding shoes and can often be used for both.  Many wakeskating shoes are designed with quick drying materials and special drainage channels.  The drainage channels are a system of holes in the sole and channels through the midsole.6  Most of the recognizable Skateboard shoe manufacturers are starting to develop shoes for Wakeskaters, with 


DVS

 being the first legitimate skate shoe company to commit to a wakeskate specific shoe back in 2004 (though they outfitted Thomas Horrell and select members of the Cassette team since 1999). Some wakeskating shoes are built with an EVA midsole.  EVA is Ethylene-vinyl acetate.  This polymer is an ideal material for the production of shoes, because it will not crack under stress.  EVA is also perfect for the outdoors, because it is not affected by UV radiation.  Other applications for EVA are padding in sport equipment.7   This special lightweight buoyant material is perfect for keeping down the weight of a soaking wet shoe.

Brazilian intelligence agencies
History of Brazil




The National Intelligence Service (Servico Nacional de Informacoes, or SNI) of 

Brazil
 was an 
intelligence agency formed by the 








Castelo Branco







 
government in 
1964. SNI was disbanded for a time and later resumed operations under the name 
Agencia Brasileira de Inteligencia.


History



Originally, the SNI was a 
civilian agency under the retired General 

Golbery do Couto e Silva
. It provided 
Castelo Branco with an alternative 
intelligence source.


After the political dominance of Brazilian hard-liners, the SNI came under military control. The agency was the backbone of the regime's 
totalitarian control. Although there have been secret police in Brazil since at least the 
Vargas era, military involvement reached new heights with the creation of the SNI. It grew out of the Institute for Research and Social Studies (Instituto de Pesquisas e Estudos Sociais or IPES), which Couto e Silva had established to undermine the former 
Goulart government (1961-64).


In 
1973, control over the domestic intelligence community with the opening of the 
Escola Nacional de Informacoes (
EsNI or National Intelligence School) was established. The following year, the EsNI absorbed the 
Escola Superior de Guerra 
postgraduate intelligence course. 


Supposedly, the EsNI did not train police agents and selected its own students. By 
1980 some officers were saying that the EsNI would be as useful as the ESG to their careers.




Structure



In theory, the SNI supervised and coordinated the intelligence agencies of the three services, but in practice the service agencies maintained their . 


The three service agencies were:



The 
Army Intelligence Center (Centro de Informacoes do Exercito, or CIE)


The 
Air force Intelligence Center (Centro de Informacoes da Aeronautica, or CISA)


The 
Naval Intelligence Center (Centro de Informacoes de Marinha, or Cenimar).




The branch 





chiefs of staff




 were technically responsible for the intelligence work in their designated service. But in fact, CIE activities followed a parallel chain of command, and so the officers were often left uninformed. 


Each command also had an Internal Operations Department-Internal Defense Operations Center (Departamento de Operacoes Internas-Centro de Operacoes de Defesa Interna -- known as 
DOI-CODI).




CIE



From the outset, there was resistance to the idea of the CIE. In 
1966 
President 








Castelo Branco







 rejected the idea of creating an army intelligence service, because it would weaken the 
General Staff. The next year, 
1967, the new minister of the army, General Aurelio de Lyra Tavares, established the CIE over the objections of the chief of staff, General Orlando Geisel. 


As early as 
1968, the CIE began 
bombing 
theaters, destroying 
bookstores, and 
kidnapping people. When 
insurgents began 
terrorist violence in late 1968, the CIE expanded to about 200 officers and began a counter-offensive, eliminating all signs of leftist violence in three years.




President Geisel
, a retired 
general, struggled to have his orders fulfilled by the CIE system. Consequently, the CIE sought to undermine his government and to make Army Minister 
Sylvio Couto Coelho da Frota the next president. The CIE also waged a 
pamphlet war against the previously mentioned Couto e Silva, chief of Geisel's Civilian Household, who wanted to shut down the CIE.




Methods of surveillance



The SNI provided clearance for anyone seeking a government job or requesting to conduct 
research in the army archives. Using an elaborate system of 
informants and 
telephone taps, the SNI accumulated and analyzed reports on many sources.


One study by 
political scientist David V. Fleischer and the late Robert Wesson suggests that there were as many as 50,000 persons employed in the SNI during the 
1964-85 regime. Furthermore, both Presidents 
Medici and 
Figueiredo had been SNI chiefs.




Notable differences















Alfred Stepan










, a 
professor of 
political science at 


Columbia University

, observed that the SNI differed from similar agencies in other countries. In retrospect, he noted that it had quite a 
monopoly in operations and training, with a voice as a ministry in the presidential cabinet and representation in almost every facet of public life. High-ranking officials helped achieve SNI 
security goals through their government positions. Moreover, the SNI was completely autonomous, giving it an unprecedented power.

Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) 












NYSE











: 
SAI is a FORTUNE 500 scientific, engineering and technology applications company in the 








United States







 with numerous federal, state, and private sector clients. It works extensively with the 

United States Department of Defense
, the 

United States Department of Homeland Security
, and the 


United States Intelligence Community

, including the 

National Security Agency
, as well as other U.S. Government civil agencies and selected commercial markets.  It was founded by 





Dr. J. Robert  Bob  Beyster




 in 1969 in 
La Jolla, California, as Science Applications Incorporated.1 As of 2008, SAIC employed 43,800 employees in 150 cities worldwide and reported $8.9 billion in revenue for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2008,2 making it number 2853 on the 

Fortune 500
  list.


In fiscal year 2003, SAIC did over $2.6 billion in business with the 

United States Department of Defense
, making it the ninth largest defense contractor in the United States. Other large contracts include their contract for 
information technology for the 
2004 Olympics in 

Greece
4 and from 2001 to 2005, SAIC was the primary contractor for the 
FBI's failed 
Virtual Case File project.5


On 
November 3, 
2003, 






Kenneth C. Dahlberg





 was named the CEO of SAIC, ending Beyster's 30+ years of leadership. In May 2005, under the new CEO, the company changed its external tagline from An Employee-Owned Company to From Science to Solutions, retaining the former for internal communications.


The company has had as part of its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government personnel including 
Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; 

William Perry
, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; 
John Deutsch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral 















Bobby Ray Inman














 who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction for the U.N. following the 1991 Gulf War and for the Bush Administration following the 2003 Iraq invasion.


In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a virtual case file system or VCF   software to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee,  When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies   17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed.  


 We fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money,  said Arnold L. Punaro, executive vice president of SAIC.


He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. During 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered, he said.


 There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period,  Punaro said. 6



Initial Public Offering


SAIC conducted an 
initial public offering of 
common stock on 
13 October 
2006. The IPO raised US$1.7 billion. After the proposed IPO, existing employee-owners would retain between 80 percent and 90 percent of the new company, meaning that the employee ownership would be substantially preserved.


On 
September 27, 
2006, during a special meeting of stockholders, employee-owners voted by a margin of 86% to proceed with the IPO. The initial stock price is estimated at $13-$15 per share, with a public offering of 75 million shares. If the underwriters, 

Bear Stearns
 and 

Morgan Stanley
, exercise overallotment options, an additional 11.25 million shares will be offered. The company also plans to pay a special dividend to existing stock holders upon completion of the IPO of $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion.




Operations


The 

Defense Intelligence Agency
 (DIA) transitioned a Remote Viewing Program to SAIC in 1991 and it was renamed 



Stargate Project


.


In January 1999, new SAIC consultant 






Steven Hatfill





 and his collaborator, SAIC vice president Joseph Soukup, commissioned William C Patrick (a retired leading figure in the old US bioweapons program) to report on the possibilities of terrorist anthrax mailings in the United States.  (There had been a spate of hoax anthrax mailings in the previous two years.)  Barbara Hatch Rosenberg said that the report was commissioned  under a CIA contract to SAIC . However, SAIC said Hatfill and Soukup commissioned it internally   there was no outside client.


Patrick produced his 28-page report in February 1999. Some subsequently saw it as a  blueprint  for the 

2001 anthrax attacks
. The report suggested the maximum amount of anthrax powder -- 2.5 grams -- that could be put in an envelope without producing a suspicious bulge. This was just a little more than the actual amounts -- 2 grams each -- in the letters sent to Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy. But the report also suggested that a terrorist might produce a spore concentration of 50 billion spores per gram. This was only one-twentieth the actual concentration -- 1 trillion spores per gram -- in the letters sent to the Senators.7


In 2002, SAIC was chosen by the 

NSA
 to produce a technology demonstration platform for the agency's Trailblazer program in a contract worth $280 million. Trailblazer is a 'Digital Network Intelligence' system, intended to analyze data carried on computer networks. Project participants included 

Boeing
, 

Computer Sciences Corporation
, and 

Booz Allen Hamilton
. SAIC had also participated in the concept definition phase of Trailblazer, beginning March 2001.8 According to science news site 






PhysOrg.com





, Trailblazer was a continuation of the earlier 
ThinThread program.9 In 2005 NSA director 


Michael Hayden

 told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule.10

American statisticians




American educator and organizational psychologist Rensis Likert (pronounced 'Lick-urt') (1903 1981) is best known for his research on 
management styles.

He developed the 
Likert Scale and the 
linking pin model.


Rensis Likert was a founder of the 

University of Michigan
's Institute for Social Research and was the director from its inception in 1946 until 1970, when he retired and founded Rensis Likert Associates to consult for numerous corporations. During his tenure, Rensis Likert devoted particular attention to research on organizations.  During the 1960s and 1970s, his books on 
management theory were extremely popular in Japan and their impact can be seen across modern Japanese organizations. He did research on major corporations around the world, and his studies have accurately predicted the subsequent performance of the corporations.



Biography



He was born in 

Cheyenne, Wyoming
 in 1903, where his father was an engineer with the 






Union Pacific Railroad





. After the  training to be an engineer, he was working as an intern with 






Union Pacific Railroad





 during the watershed 1922 
strike.  The lack of communication between the two parties made a profound impression on him and caused him to study organizations and their behaviour for the rest of his life.  


Rensis Likert received his B.A. in 
Sociology from the 

University of Michigan
 in 1926. His early grounding in these fields was the basis for much of Likert's work. The field of 
sociology in the 1920s was highly experimental and incorporated many aspects of modern 
psychology. In 1932 he received his Ph.D in 
psychology from 


Columbia University

. For his thesis work, Likert produced a survey scale (
Likert Scales) as a means of measuring attitudes, showing that it captured more information than competing methods. The 1-5 
Likert Scales would eventually become Likert's best-known work.




Central aspects of his theories


Employee centered supervision is more productive than job centered supervision.  In other words, the more the job is supervised, the less productive the people.

Bank holding company







Financial services










The Chemical Banking Corporation was the 
bank holding company for  Chemical Bank in 

New York City
 from 1823 until 1996. It changed its name to 

Chase
 following the acquisition of Chase Manhattan.



History


The company was founded in 1823 as the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company in 









Greenwich Village








.  It produced 
chemicals such as 
blue vitriol, 
alum, 
nitric acid, 
camphor and 
saltpeter, as well as medicines, paints and 
dyes.1


Its charter was amended in 1824 to allow banking practices.  It became the Chemical Bank of New York in 1844 and completely left the manufacturing business in 1851 although the name was to stick.


It received its 
national charter in 1865.  Following a series of acquisitions it merged with the 



Corn Exchange Bank


 to become the Chemical Corn Exchange Bank in 1954.  It continued acquisitions and  became the Chemical Banking Corporation in 1988.


In 1986, it acquired 



Texas Commerce Bank


, and, at the end of 1991, it acquired 



Manufacturers Hanover Corporation


.  In 1996, Chemical acquired 
The Chase Manhattan Corporation and continued under the Chase name until acquiring 



J.P. Morgan   Co.


 in December 2000 to form 
JPMorgan Chase   Co.  Throughout all of these acquisitions, Chemical's original management team remained in charge of both the bank and its private equity investment group, JP Morgan Partners, until acquiring 
Bank One in 2004.

Offices


It opened at 216 Broadway in 
Downtown New York in 1824 and in 1848 moved to 
270 Broadway. For many years it was called  Old Bullion 2 because of its refusal to make 
specie payments in 1857, even though all other 












clearing house











 banks had done so.


The bank moved to 165 Broadway in the late 1920s3 and was to move to 277 





Park Avenue




 in 1980.  It moved across Park Avenue in 1991 to occupy the former headquarters of 



Manufacturers Hanover Corporation


 at 
270 Park Avenue, which is now the headquarters of Chase.

Islands of Thailand









Maya Bay






Another view of Maya Bay






Ko Phi Phi Leh (or Ko Phi Phi Ley) is an 
island of the 
Phi Phi archipelago, in the 
Andaman Sea. It belongs to the 
Krabi province of 

Thailand
.



Geography



Ko Phi Phi Leh is the second largest island of the 
archipelago, the largest one being 




Ko Phi Phi Don



. The island consists of a ring of steep 
limestone hills surrounding a shallow bay, the Mahya Bay.




Miscellaneous



Mahya Bay (or Maya Bay) is popular for diving, and has become even more popular after the 
2000 movie 


The Beach

 was filmed there.
According to the Lonely Planet's Thailand guidebook, the 






2004 tsunami





 dramatically improved the look of Maya Bay. This was due to the fact that the high waves had cleaned up the beach and removed all the landscaping the Fox production team had added.




The Beach


Controversy arose during the making of the film 


The Beach

 due to 

20th Century Fox
 bulldozing and rescaping of the natural beach setting of Ko Phi Phi Leh to make it more  paradise-like . The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state, however lawsuits were filed as many believed the damage to the 
ecosystem is permanent and restoration attempts failed.


The lawsuits dragged on for years. In 2006, Thailand's Supreme Court upheld an appeal court ruling that the filming had harmed the environment and ordered that damage assessments be made. Defendants in the case included 20th Century Fox and some Thai government officials.




The island before and after



Prior to 2004 the island had avoided development. However, it is now a part of Phi Phi National Park and has since begun to see the beginnings of development and some clearing of natural plant life. There are current plans to build bungalows on the island and as of 2004 an entry-fee of 40 
Baht has been charged; as of February 2007 the charge for private visitors has been raised to Bt200 per person. There are now permanent basic facilities on the island - toilets, a snack bar and camping sites.

In 
sports, a Most Valuable Player (MVP) 
award is an honor typically bestowed upon the best performing player or players on a specific team, in an entire league, or for a particular contest or series of contests. Initially used in professional sports, the term is now also commonly used in amateur sports, as well as in other completely unrelated fields of endeavor such as 
business and 
music 
awards.


The term  Most Valuable Player  is most often used in the 








United States







. In many sports, some MVP awards are presented just for a specific game or match (in other words, a 
man of the match award), while others are awarded based on an entire 
season or year. The 
gender neutral term  Player of the Match  is usually substituted for  Man of the Match  in women's team competitions.1


Specific North American examples include (first regular season, then playoffs):



 



Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award


 and 



World Series MVP Award





 




National Football League Most Valuable Player Award



 and 
Super Bowl MVP Award


 

National Hockey League
 




Lester B. Pearson Award



 and 
Hart Trophy (regular season) and 




Conn Smythe Trophy



 (playoffs)


 
National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award and 
National Basketball Association Finals Most Valuable Player Award


 



Women's National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award


 and 
Women's National Basketball Association Finals Most Valuable Player Award




One award is commonly referred to as an  MVP  award, despite the fact that its official name does not match the  MVP  initialism:








NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player

Non-sports uses


The 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences makes  Most Valuable Player  awards annually in a number of instrumental categories.


MVP is often used in business to designate a valued employee. In this context, sometimes the  P  in  MVP  is something other than  Player.  So, for example, 

Microsoft
 uses MVP to mean 
Most Valuable Professional. The term is applied to recognized, credible, and accessible individuals with expertise in one or more Microsoft products who actively participate in online and offline communities to share their knowledge and expertise with other Microsoft customers.


It is also used in video game terms, such as the game 
Call of Duty 4 contains challenges to kill the  MVP  of the opposing team a certain amount of times and 









Halo 3








 to mean the person with the highest score or amount of kills.


It was also used in a Disney Channel Original Movie, .

The Disinherited


Ever since the death of 











John Comyn










 at the hands of 

Robert Bruce
 and his supporters in 1306 the 











Wars of Scottish Independence










 had also become a civil war.  The 
Treaty of Northampton in 1328 brought to an end over thirty years of intermittent warfare between England and Scotland; but it also left a large and discontented party of Anglo-Scots, men with Balliol and Comyn associations, who had lost lands and property in Scotland.  In 1332 under the leadership of 












Edward Balliol











, son and heir of King 
John Balliol, and 
Henry Beaumont, 4th Earl of Buchan, these men invaded Scotland with the tacit support of 


Edward III

, defeating the Bruce loyalists at the 

Battle of Dupplin Moor
.  Building on this success Balliol was crowned King of Scotland.  However, with very limited support in his new realm, he was ambushed at 
Annan a few months later by supporters of 

David II
, Robert Bruce's son and heir.  Balliol fled to England half-dressed.  He appealed to King Edward for assistance, having already promised to cede to him all of the counties of south-east Scotland in return.  Edward dropped all pretence of neutrality, recognised Balliol as King of Scotland and made ready for war.




Berwick Under Siege



At the beginning of 1333 the atmosphere on the border was tense.  England was openly preparing for war.  In Scotland Archibald Douglas, brother of the  Good  
Sir James Douglas, and now Guardian of the Realm for the underage David, made arrangements for the defence of 

Berwick-upon-Tweed
.  Weapons and supplies were gathered, and the defence of the town was entrusted to Sir Alexander Seton.  These preparations were all complete by the time Balliol crossed into 

Roxburghshire
 on 10 March.  Besides the disinherited lords he was also accompanied by a number of English magnates.  The army advanced quickly towards Berwick, which was placed under siege.  The deceptions of the previous year had gone.  Balliol was acting quite openly in the English interest.  The Second War of Independence was underway.  


Edward arrived at Berwick in person in May, after leaving 

Queen Philippa
 in the safety of 








Bamburgh Castle







 on the 
Northumberland coast.  His ally and protege had been at Berwick for some two months, and had been so far unmolested that he had been able to place the town under close siege.  Trenches had been dug, the water supply cut and all communication with the hinterland ended.  The Guardian's inactivity contrasts sharply with Robert Bruce's swift response to the siege of 1319.  Douglas seems to have spent the time gathering a national army, rather than using the troops he already had in diversionary raids.  


With the arrival of the English king the attack on Berwick began in earnest.  Seton carried out a spirited defence; but by the end of June, under repeated attack by land and sea, his troops were close to exhaustion.  He requested and was granted a short truce, but only on the condition that he surrender if not relieved by 11 July.  As a guarantee of good faith Seton was required to hand over a number of hostages, which included his son, Thomas.  Scotland was now faced with exactly the same situation that England had before 

Bannockburn
: as a matter of national pride Douglas would have to come to the relief of Berwick, just as 

Edward II
 had come to the relief of 









Stirling Castle








 in 1314.  The army the Guardian had spent so much time gathering was now compelled to take to the field, with all initiative lost.  Nevertheless, Douglas' force was an impressive representation of the nation's strength and unity, with volunteers coming from all corners of the realm.  As with all medieval armies the precise number of troops is difficult to estimate.  It is possible, though, that the army was at least as strong as that which had fought at Bannockburn, perhaps even stronger.  Douglas now began his belated march to the border.




Advance to Bamburgh



In an attempt to draw Edward away from Berwick Douglas entered England on 11 July, the last day of Seton's truce.  He advanced eastwards to the little port of 
Tweedmouth, in contested 
Northumberland. Tweedmouth was destroyed in sight of the English army: Edward did not move.  A small party of Scots led by Sir William Keith managed with some difficulty to make their way across the ruins of the old bridge to the northern bank of the Tweed.  Keith and some of his men were able to force their way through to the town.  Douglas chose to consider this as a technical relief and sent messages to Edward calling on him to depart.  This was accompanied with the threat that if he failed to do so the Scots army would continue south and devastate England.  Again Edward did not move, so Douglas marched south to Bamburgh, perhaps hoping for a repeat of the events that led in former years to the 

Battle of Myton
.  Whatever concerns the king had for his queen he knew that Bamburgh was strong and could easily withstand a siege.  The Scots, moreover, did not have the time to construct the kind of equipment that would be necessary to take the fortress by assault.  For Berwick, on the other hand, time was definitely running out.




Prince Returns



Edward refused to consider Keith's entry into Berwick as a relief in terms of the agreement of 28 June.  As the truce had now expired, and the town had not surrendered, he ordered the hostages to be hanged before the walls, beginning with Thomas Seton.  A further two were to be hanged on each subsequent day for as long as the garrison refused to capitulate.  Edward's determination had the desired effect.  To save the lives of those who remained Seton concluded a fresh truce, promising to surrender if not relieved by Tuesday 20 July.  Everything now hinged on a Scots victory in battle.    News of this was carried to the Guardian at Bamburgh.  Having lost all freedom of action he returned north into the teeth of the wolf.




Halidon Hill





Monument on Halidon Hill, alongside the A6105 Berwick-
Foulden, Berwickshire road. with the date of battle.



Edward and his army took up position on Halidon Hill, a small rise of some 600 ft. two miles to the north-west of Berwick, which gives an excellent view of the town and surrounding countryside.  From this vantage point he was able to dominate all of the approaches to the beleaguered port. Any attempt by Douglas to by-pass the hill and march directly on Berwick would have been quickly overwhelmed.  Crossing the Tweed to the west of the English position, the Guardian reached the town of 
Duns on 18 July.  On the following day he approached Halidon Hill from the north-west, ready to give battle on ground chosen by his enemy.  It was a catastrophic decision.  The Book of Pluscarden, a Scots chronicle, describes the scene;


They (the Scots) marched towards the town with great display, in order of battle, and recklessly, stupidly and inadvisedly chose a battle ground at Halidon Hill, where there was a marshy hollow between the two armies, and where a great downward slope, with some precipices, and then again a rise lay in front of the Scots, before they could reach the field wherte the English were posted. 



The approach was observed by Henry Beaumont, who would have advised Edward of the tactics that brought victory at Dupplin Moor when the two met at York the previous December.  The order of battle now employed mirrored those used at Dupplin, with some variations owing to superior strength.  The army was divided into three divisions, comprising infantry, men-at-arms and knights.  All made ready to fight on foot in a defensive position.  The left was commanded by Balliol; the centre by Edward; and the right by 








Thomas Brotherton







, 


Earl of Norfolk

, and Earl Marshall of England.  Standing on the flanks of each division were six supporting wings of archers.  The bowmen projected slightly forward in a wedge formation to offer maximum use of supporting crossfire, an arrangement later adopted at 
Crecy. Edward was required to take no further action: for if Douglas refused to give battle, as caution and good sense demanded, Berwick would fall by default.


Douglas' army was also arranged in three divisions, drawn up in traditional 
schiltron formation: the Guardian commanded the left; 
Robert Stewart, the future king, commanded the centre; and 


John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray

 the right.  As Pluscarden says, to engage the English they had to advance downhill, cross a large area of marshy ground, and then climb up the northern slope of Halidon Hill.  Although the Scots spearmen had proved their worth against cavalry at 

Stirling Bridge
 and Bannockburn, the battles of Dupplin Moor and 
Falkirk had shown how vulnerable they were to arrow fire.  Not only was the ground bad, but it must have been obvious to the Guardian as he looked towards the massed ranks of Edward's archers that this was not going to be a cavalry battle.  The prudent course of action would have been to withdraw and wait for a better opportunity to fight; but this would mean the automatic loss of Berwick.  The Scots were now to fight possibly the most disadvantageous battle in their history, exceeded only by the even more disastrous 
Battle of Flodden two centuries later.




Into the Sleet


No sooner had the Scots entered the marsh at the foot of the hill than the first arrows began to descend.  They continued to fall in great clouds as the schiltrons freed themselves from the marshy ground and began the ascent up Halidon Hill.  Having lost all momentum they moved slowly upwards, so tightly packed that even the most indifferent archer could scarcely fail to hit his target.  The fire was so intense that many turned their faces away as if walking into a storm of sleet.  The Lanercost Chronicle reports; ...the Scots who marched in the front were so wounded in the face and blinded by the multitude of English arrows that they could not help themselves, and soon began to turn their faces away from the blows of the arrows and fall.  Casualties were heavy, with some of the finest troops falling dead or wounded on the lower reaches of the hill. The survivors crawled upwards, through the arrows and on to the waiting spears.  


It was Moray's depleted schiltron that first made contact with the enemy, closing on Balliol's division on the left.  The Stewart followed, advancing on King Edward in the centre. Douglas came in their wake.  But even before Stewart and Douglas arrived Moray's front ranks were failing in the hand-to-hand fighting with Balliol.  With no let up in the arrow fire, the schiltron broke, retreating rapidly downhill.  Panic spread from the centre to the left.  With English arrow fire directed towards the flanks the Scots bunched in a disorganised mass towards the centre, much as they had done at Dupplin Moor, as if each man was trying to hide from death behind the body of his comrade.  Those in the rear began running back towards the marsh, away from the killing ground.  Scots honour was saved by the Earl of Ross and his Highlanders, who fought to the death in a gallant rearguard action.  


With Ross gone the English knights took to horse, riding off in pursuit of the fugitives.  Stewart together with the earls of Moray and Strathern all managed to escape; but few others were as lucky.  The battlefield was a grim place; the Guardian lay dead with five other earls.  They died in the company of the nameless commons of Scotland, who fell in their thousands.  English casualties were light.  The following day Berwick surrendered.




Shock and Celebration



News of Halidon sent shock waves across southern Scotland.  Edward soon received the fealty of several important landowners in the area.  In England the victory, the first for many years, brought a great boost to the morale of the nation.  Bannockburn had finally been avenged.  The English poet, 






Laurence Minot





, was exultant;


A little fro that foresaid toune (Berwick)
Halydon-hill that es the name
Thaire was crakked many a crowne
Of wild Scottes, and alls of tame;
Thaire was thaire banner born all doune.



Other balladeers celebrated the restoration of English national pride;


Scottes out of Berwick and Aberdeen
At the Burn of Bannock ye were far too keen.
King Edward has avenged it now, and fully too, I ween.


Edward's Victory at Halidon Hill was a more devastating blow to Scotland than his grandfather's at 
Dunbar.  After Dunbar most of the nobles had been captured and lived to fight another day; after Halidon most of the country's natural leaders were dead, and the few who remained were in hiding.  Scotland was prostrate.  It was said at the time that the English victory had been so complete that it marked the final end of the northern war.  Yet a mere five years afterwards the chronicler Adam Murimuth was to write;


And so, men freely declare that the Scotch wars had been brought to their close, that nothing remained of the Scotch nation that was willing or able to defend or govern itself.  Yet they were wrong as the sequel showed.



The time that had passed before Murimuth wrote these words had shown Halidon to be a barren victory.  For Edward did little to exploit his success; and Scottish resistance, though weak, was never fully extinguished.

The ground sharks, order Carcharhiniformes, are the largest order of 
sharks; they are also called whaler sharks. With over 270 species, carcharhiniforms include a number of common types, such as the 
blue shark, catsharks, swellsharks, and 
sandbar shark.  


Members of the orders are characterized by the presence of a 
nictitating membrane over the eye, two 
dorsal fins, an 
anal fin, and five 
gill slits.


The families of the carcharhiniforms are expected to be revised; recent 
DNA studies show that some of the traditional groups are not 
monophyletic.

 Civil services
Examinations




Civic service exams were implemented in various countries as a way to achieve an effective, rational 
public administration on a 
merit system. The most ancient example of such exams were in 
Imperial China. 

Prussia
 then implemented such procedures in the turn of the nineteenth century. 

In the United Kingdom, a permanent, unisex and politically 
neutral civil service, in which appointments were made on merit, was introduced on the recommendations of the Northcote-Trevelyan report of 
1854, which also recommended a clear division between staff responsible for routine ( mechanical ) work, and those engaged in policy formulation and implementation in an  administrative  class. The report was well-timed, since bureaucratic chaos in the 

Crimean War
 (1854-56) promptly caused a clamour for the change.  A 
Civil Service Commission was accordingly set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage, and balls of the other Northcote-Trevelyan recommendations implemented over some years. This system was broadly endorsed by Commissions chaired by Playfair (1874), Ridley (1886), MacDonnell (1914), Tomlin (1931) and Priestley (1955). 


Civil service examination was established in the 
United States with the 1883 
Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act.  Currently, a written exam is only required for a minority of US civil service positions; merit is evaluated by examining factors such as education and experience.

Mikhail Kutuzov





Prince Mikhail Illarionovich Golenishchev-Kutuzov (

Russian
:                                       -        ) (September 16 [
O.S. September 5] 1745   April 28 [
O.S. April 16] 1813) was the 

Russia
n 
Field Marshal who defeated the 


Napoleon's

 
Grande Armee during 
Napoleon's 

invasion
 of Russia of 1812, the decisive turning point of the 

Napoleonic Wars
.



Early career



Golenishchev-Kutuzov (usually shortened as Kutuzov), born at 

Saint Petersburg
, entered the Russian army in 1759 or 1760. He saw active service in 

Poland
 (1764   1769), and against the 

Turks
 (1770   1774); lost an eye in action in the latter year; and after that traveled for some years in central and western 
Europe. 


In 1784 he became a major-general, in 1787 
governor-general of the 

Crimea
; and under 























Suvorov






















, whose disciple he became, he won considerable distinction in the 
Russo-Turkish War of 1787 1792, at the taking of 
Ochakov, 

Odessa
, 
Bender and 

Ismail
, and the battles of Rimnik and Mashin. He was now (1791) a lieutenant-general, and successively occupied the positions of ambassador at 
Constantinople, governor-general of 

Finland
, commandant of the corps of 
cadets at Saint Petersburg, ambassador at 















Berlin














, and governor-general of Saint Petersburg.


Kutuzov was a favorite of Czar 


Paul I

, and after that emperor's murder he was temporarily out of favor with by the new Czar 


Alexander I

, though he remained loyal towards Alexander.




 Napoleonic wars in Europe 






Kutuzov at the Battle of Borodino.



In 1805 he commanded the Russian corps which opposed 


Napoleon

's advance on 


Vienna

, and won the hard-fought action of 
Durrenstein on 
11 November 
1805.


On the eve of 

Austerlitz
 Kutuzov tried to prevent the Allied generals from fighting a battle, and, being overruled by the tsar, as well as the Austrian battle planner, Feldzeugmeister Weyrother, he feigned sleep during the battle planning, determined not to be blamed for a defeat. He was, however, present at the battle itself (
2 December 
1805), and was wounded. From 1806 to 1811 Kutuzov served as governor-general of 



Lithuania


 and 

Kiev
. 


He was then put in charge of the Russian army operating against the Turks in the 
Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812. Understanding that his armies would be needed badly in the upcoming fight with the French, he hastily brought the prolonged war to a victorious end and concluded the propitious 
Treaty of Bucharest, which stipulated for incorporation of 


Bessarabia

 into the 

Russian Empire
. For this success he was made 
prince (
knyaz).




The Patriotic War (1812)





Kutuzov at the Fili conference decides to surrender Moscow to Napoleon.



When 
Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, 
Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly (then Minister of War) chose to follow the 
scorched earth principle and retreat rather than to risk a major battle. His strategy aroused grudges from most of the generals and soldiers, notably Prince 
















Pyotr Bagration















. Therefore, when Kutuzov was appointed commander-in-chief and arrived to the army on 
August 17, he was greeted with delight.


Within two weeks Kutuzov decided to give major battle on approaches to 

Moscow
. Two huge armies clashed near 

Borodino
 on 
7 September 
1812 in what has been described as the greatest battle in human history up to that date, involving nearly a quarter of a million soldiers. The result of the battle was inconclusive, with a quarter of the French and half of the Russian army killed or wounded. After the famous conference at the village of 
Fili, Kutuzov fell back on the strategy of his predecessor:  withdraw in order to save the Russian army as long as possible. 


This came at the price of losing Moscow, whose population was evacuated. Having retreated along the 

Kaluga
 road and replenished his ammunitions, he forced Napoleon into retreat in the 

Battle of Maloyaroslavets
. The old general's cautious pursuit evoked much criticism, but ultimately only a small remnant (93,000 of the 690,000 men) of the 
Grand Army returned to 

Prussia
n soil alive. Hence the Russian general's caution was thoroughly vindicated.


Kutuzov now held the rank of Field Marshal and had been awarded the 
victory title of His Serene Highness 
Knyaz Smolensky (                           ) - having achieved this title 

for a victory over part of the French army
 at 





Smolensk




 in November 1812.

Suvorov






















. 





Alexander Pushkin




 addressed the Field Marshal in the famous elegy on Kutuzov's sepulchre, and he also figures as a patient and wise leader in 



Leo Tolstoy


's 
War and Peace. During the

Mammoth Mountain from the north (Minaret Summit)



Mammoth Mountain is a large 
lava dome complex1 that lies to the west of the town of 

Mammoth Lakes, California
 in the 




Inyo National Forest



. It is home to a large ski area.

Mammoth Mountain was formed in a series of eruptions that ended 57,000 years ago. However, Mammoth still produces hazardous volcanic gases that kill trees and have caused ski patroller fatalities.



Recreational use


Mammoth Mountain is home to the 

Mammoth Mountain Ski Area
 which is notable in that it gets an unusually large amount of snow compared to other Eastern 


Sierra

 peaks, due to Mammoth Mountain lying in a low gap in the Sierra crest.2 In the summer months the ski 
gondolas are used by 
mountain bikers and  tourists who wish to get a spectacular summit view of 







Long Valley Caldera






 directly to the east and Sierra peaks to the west, south and north.




Geology



Origins



The mountain was formed from a long series of eruptions that started  about 110,000 years ago and lasted to perhaps 57,000 years ago,3 although the volcano is still active with minor eruptions; the largest of which was a minor 
phreatic (steam) eruption 700 years ago.1 Mammoth Mountain is composed primarily of 
dacite and 
rhyolite;4 some of which have been altered by 
hydrothermal activity from 
fumaroles (steam vents).5 Mammoth lies on the South end of the 










Mono-Inyo









 chain of 
volcanic craters,6 some of which erupted as recently as 250 years ago.7
Mammoth Mountain is on the southwestern edge of Long Valley Caldera,8 a large area that subsided after an enormous eruption 760,000 years ago.4 The Mammoth Mountain magamatic system is considered distinct from that of Long Valley caldera and Inyo Craters.1910




Volcanic gas discharge


Mammoth is outgassing large amounts of 
carbon dioxide out of its South flank, near Horseshoe Lake. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the ground ranges from 20 to 90 percent CO2. Measurements of the total discharge of carbon dioxide gas at the Horseshoe Lake tree kill area range from 50 to 150 short tons (45 to 140 MT) per day. This high concentration causes trees to die in six regions that total about 170 acres (0.69 km2) in size (see photo, below).11  Camping has been prohibited in the tree kill area since 1995, to prevent 
asphyxiation of campers due to accumulation of carbon dioxide in tents and restrooms.


The tree kills originally were attributed to a severe drought that affected California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Another idea was that the kills were the result of a 
pathogen or other biological infestation. However neither idea explained why all trees in the affected areas were killed regardless of age or health. Then in March 1990, a 

United States Forest Service
 ranger became ill with 
suffocation symptoms after being in a snow-covered cabin near Horseshoe Lake.12





Carbon dioxide has killed a large area of trees





Measurements around the lake found that restrooms and 
tents had a greater than 1% CO2 concentration (toxic), and a deadly 25% concentration of CO2 in a small cabin.  CO2 concentrations of less than 1% are typical and healthy in most 
soils, however soil concentrations of CO2 in the tree kill areas ranged from 20% to 90%. This overabundance of CO2 was found to be the cause of the tree kills because tree roots need to absorb O2 directly and the high CO2 level reduced available O2. Researchers also determined that Mammoth releases about 1,300 short tons (1,200 MT) of CO2 every day. 
As of 2003 the concentration of carbon dioxide in soil gas at Mammoth Mountain is being monitored on a continuous, year-round basis at four sites - three at Horseshoe Lake and one near the base of Chair 19 at the ski area.11





Mammoth Mountain from the east



The most likely sources of the CO2 are degassing of intruded 
magma and gas release from 
limestone-rich 
metasedimentary rocks that are heated by magmatic intrusions. The remarkable uniformity in chemical and 
isotopic composition of the CO2 and accompanying gases at different locations around Mammoth Mountain indicates that there may actually be a large reservoir of gas deep below the mountain from which gas escapes along 
faults to the surface.11 Measurements of helium emissions support the theory that the gases emitted in the tree kill area have the same source as those discharged from Mammoth Mountain Fumarole.1310 There is evidence that the rate of CO2 discharge has been declining,14 with emissions peaking in 1991.15





The view from Dry Creek.





On 
April 6, 
2006, three ski patrollers at the ski area perished due to a combination of CO2 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning.16 Both gases are present on a known dangerous 
fumarole on the mountain and were more concentrated on that day because the fumarole had been covered by snow for days. Four patrollers, including John  Scott  McAndrews and James Juarez, were raising the fence around the fumarole, which had become buried due to heavy snowfall. The fumarole had melted a cavern below the 
snowbridge which collapsed under James and Scott. The pair of men fell 21 feet (6.4 m)and perished within a matter of minutes. Another ski patroller, Walt Rosenthal, perished and seven others were injured trying to rescue James and Scott. Unfortunately, the only type of oxygen mask used by the Mammoth Mountain ski patrol was of the kind that does not completely seal outer gases from coming in.16

Guiding







Brownies from the UK.



A Brownie is a member of a section of some 
Guiding organisations who is between the ages of 7 and 10. Exact age limits are slightly different in each organisation. It is the female-centred equivalent of the 
Cub Scouts.


History


Brownies were first organized by 

Lord Baden-Powell
 in 1914, to complete the range of age groups both for girls and boys in Scouting. They were first run as the youngest group in the Guide Association by 






Agnes Baden-Powell





, Lord Baden-Powell's younger sister. In 1918 

His wife, Lady Olave Baden-Powell
, took over the responsibility for the Girl Guides and thus for Brownies.


Originally the girls were called Rosebuds, but were renamed by Lord Baden-Powell after the girls had complained that they didn't like their name. Their name comes from the story  The Brownies  by 


Juliana Horatia Ewing

, written in 1870. In the story two children, Tommy and Betty, learn that children can be helpful 
Brownies or lazy 
boggarts.




Motto, Promise And Law



Australia


In 

Australia
 (which phased out the distinction between Brownies and  full  Guides in 1996) the Guiding Promise is:


I promise that I will do my best,

:to do my duty to God,


to serve the Queen and my country, 

:to help other people, and to keep the Guide law.




Canada


In 

Canada
, the Brownie Promise is:


I promise to do my best,

:To be true to myself, my God/Faith and Canada,


I will help other people,

:And keep the Brownie Law.


Canadian Girl Guides are able to choose to either say the word God or Faith in the promise.


The Canadian Brownie Law is:


As a Brownie I am honest and kind. I help take care of the world around me.


The Canadian Brownie Motto is:


Lend a Hand






Singapore


The 

Singapore
an Brownie Promise is:


I promise to do my best, 

:to do my duty to God, 


to serve my country, 

:help other people and to 


keep the Brownie Law.


The Singaporean Brownie law is: 


a brownie obeys and respect her elders.

:a brownie thinks of others before herself.


a brownie tells the truth.

:a brownie is neat and tidy.


a brownie is thrifty.

:a brownie plays and works cheerfully.


The Singaporean Brownie Moto is:
Lend a hand




United Kingdom


In the 











United Kingdom










, the Brownie Promise is:


I promise that I will do my best,

:To love my God,


To serve the Queen and my country,

:to help other people,


And to keep the Brownie Guide Law.


The Brownie Guide Law is:


A Brownie Guide thinks of others before herself and does a good turn every day.


The Brownie motto used to be Lend a Hand (LAH). With the introduction of the new program in the United Kingdom, the motto was dropped for Brownies.




United States of America


In the 
United States of America, the Girl Scout Promise is:


On my honor, I will try:

:To serve God and my country,


To help people at all times,

:And to live by the Girl Scout Law.


Girl Scouts are given a choice of  whatever word your spiritual beliefs dictate  in place of the word God.

East Greenbush is a 
town in 

Rensselaer County
, 





New York




, 
USA.  The population was 15,560 at the 2000 census.  The name is derived from the 

Dutch
  Green Bosch,  referring to the pine woods that originally covered the land. The first settlement of the land now known as East Greenbush was made by tenants under Patroon Kiliaen Rensselaer prior to 1631, according to area history books.

The Town of East Greenbush is located in the western edge of the county.




Interstate 90
 passes through the town. It contains the west end of 
US 4 as well as 

US 9
 and 
US 20.



Geography

 
According to the 

United States Census Bureau
, the town has a total area of 24.4 
square miles (63.1 
km ), of which, 24.1 square miles (62.4 km ) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.6 km ) of it (1.03%) is water.


The west town line is partly defined by the 



Hudson River


 with 

Albany County
, 





New York




 on the opposite shore.

married couples living together, 10.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.2% were non-families. 25.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 3.02.


In the town the population was spread out with 24.1% under the age of 18, 6.4% from 18 to 24, 30.2% from 25 to 44, 25.7% from 45 to 64, and 13.6% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 90.0 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.9 males.


The median income for a household in the town was $53,822, and the median income for a family was $62,917. Males had a median income of $43,028 versus $31,777 for females. The 
per capita income for the town was $25,503.  About 1.7% of families and 3.0% of the population were below the 
poverty line, including 2.8% of those under age 18 and 3.3% of those age 65 or over.




 Education 


The East Greenbush Central School District serves the majority of our community, with the student population of approximately 4,600. The Averill Park School District serves a very small portion of the eastern part of the town. The East Greenbush Central School District has 5 elementary schools, 1 middle school, and 1 high school.

 Genet Elementary School 


Formerly Genet Middle School (in addition to being the original Columbia High School, constructed as part of economic relief during the 





Great Depression




) Genet Elementary School is named after Citizen 
Edmond Charles Edouard Genet.  The first Minister Plenipotentiary from the Republic of 

France
 to the United States, sent over in 1793, Genet clashed with 


Alexander Hamilton

 and eventually 





George Washington




 over the Administration's stance of 
neutrality in the growing difficulties between France and 

England
. Frustrated, he made several remarks about Congress and Washington that appear to have been misconstrued, and then printed in the press. A full retraction followed, but it was too late, and Genet was recalled from his post after barely one year of employment. As the 
Terreur raged in 

Paris
, 
Robespierre attempted to have Genet extradited for execution, but Washington refused the request. Genet married the daughter of 


George Clinton

, first Governor of the 
State of New York, and eventually moved to Prospect Hill in East Greenbush, a farm estate on Hayes Road. Genet continued to communicate with political leaders, he patented over thirty scientific inventions, and he advised on the defense of 




New York Harbor



 and the building of the 



Erie Canal


. He died in 1834 in East Greenbush.

English idioms
English phrases




To wish to have one's cake and eat it too or simply have one's cake and eat it (sometimes eat one's cake and have it too) is to want more than one can handle or deserve, or to try to have two incompatible things. This is a popular English idiomatic 
proverb, or figure of speech.


History


The phrase's earliest recording is from 
1546 as  wolde you bothe eate your cake, and have your cake?  (







John Heywood






's 'A dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of All the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongue')1 alluding to the impossibility of eating your cake and still having it afterwards; the modern version (where the clauses are reversed) is a corruption which was first signaled in 
1812.


Paul Brians, Professor of English at Washington State University, points out that perhaps a more logical or easier to understand version of this saying is:  You can t eat your cake and have it too . Professor Brians writes that a common source of confusion about this idiom stems from the verb to have which in this case indicates that once eaten possession of the cake is no longer possible.2 
Alternatively, the two verbs can be understood to represent a sequence of actions, so one can indeed  have  one's cake and then  eat  it. Consequently, the literal meaning of the reversed idiom doesn't match the metaphorical meaning.




References in Pop Culture







Comedian 


George Carlin

 once critiqued this idiom by saying,  When people say, 'Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too.' What good is a cake you can't eat? What should I eat, someone else's cake instead? .


Have Your Cake and Eat It Too is a book by 
Susan G. Purdy. 





Bob Dylan

 changed the phrase in his song  




Lay Lady Lay



  in the line:  You can have your cake and eat it, too.  


The phrase is also alluded to in  Everybody Loves You Now  by 




Billy Joel



; a song by the 

Jersey Boys
;  Catch  by 

Kosheen
 (as  have your cake / and eat it ); and in  Life O'Riley  by 


NOFX

. 


The live version of 


Eve 6

's 

Inside Out
 featured the phrase. 


In his novel 





Flaubert's Parrot




 (1984), 


Julian Barnes

 writes:  You can have your cake and eat it too - the only trouble is, you get fat. 






Unabomber Reversal


The reversal of this expression helped in the identification of the 
Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski.  In the Unabomber's  Manifesto , it was written,  ...you can't eat your cake and have it too.  To gain one thing you have to sacrifice another.   His brother David Kaczynski was able to identify Ted after reading the  Manifesto .  Ted and their mother both used the more accurate but older and less popular use of the phrase. 3

Determinants
Matrices
Numerical linear algebra
Approximation theory




In 
linear algebra, a Hilbert matrix is a matrix with the 
unit fraction elements



 H_{ij} = \frac{1}{i+j-1}. 


For example, this is the 5  times; 5 Hilbert matrix:




H = \begin{bmatrix} 
1   \frac{1}{2}   \frac{1}{3}   \frac{1}{4}   \frac{1}{5} \\[4pt]
\frac{1}{2}   \frac{1}{3}   \frac{1}{4}   \frac{1}{5}   \frac{1}{6} \\[4pt]
\frac{1}{3}   \frac{1}{4}   \frac{1}{5}   \frac{1}{6}   \frac{1}{7} \\[4pt]
\frac{1}{4}   \frac{1}{5}   \frac{1}{6}   \frac{1}{7}   \frac{1}{8} \\[4pt]
\frac{1}{5}   \frac{1}{6}   \frac{1}{7}   \frac{1}{8}   \frac{1}{9} \end{bmatrix}.


The Hilbert matrix can be regarded as derived from the integral




 H_{ij} = \int_{0}^{1} x^{i+j-2} \, dx, 


that is, as a 
Gramian matrix for powers of x.  It is a 
Hankel matrix.


The Hilbert matrices are canonical examples of 
ill-conditioned matrices, making them notoriously difficult to use in numerical computation.  For example, the 2-norm 
condition number of the matrix above is about 4.8   105.



Historical note



In Hilbert's 
oeuvre, the Hilbert matrix figures in his article Ein Beitrag zur Theorie des Legendreschen Polynoms (published in the journal 






Acta Mathematica





, vol. 18, 155-159, 1894). 


That article addresses the following question in 
approximation theory:  Assume that I = [''a'', ''b''] is a real interval. Is it then possible to find a non-zero polynomial P with integral coefficients, such that the integral 




\int_{a}^b P(x)^2 dx 


is smaller than any given bound \varepsilon gt;0, taken arbitrarily small?  Using the asymptotics of the 
determinant of the Hilbert matrix he proves that this is possible if the length b  minus; a of the interval is smaller than 4. 


He derives the exact formula  




\det(H)={{c_n^{\;4}}\over {c_{2n}}} 


for the determinant of the n  times; n Hilbert matrix. Here cn is




\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} i^{n-i}=\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} i!.\,


Hilbert also mentions the curious fact that the determinant of the Hilbert matrix is the reciprocal of an integer (see sequence 
A005249) which he expresses as the 
discriminant of a certain hypergeometric polynomial related to the 
Legendre polynomial. This fact also follows from the identity




 {1 \over \det (H)}={{c_{2n}}\over {c_n^{\;4}}}=n!\cdot \prod_{i=1}^{2n-1} {i \choose [i/2]}
 


Using 
Euler MacLaurin summation on the 
logarithm of the cn he obtains the raw asymptotic result




\det(H)=4^{-n^2+r_n}


where the error term rn is o(n2). A more precise asymptotic result (which can be established using 
Stirling's approximation of the 
factorial) is




\det(H)=a_n\, n^{-1/4}(2\pi)^n \,4^{-n^2}


where an converges to the constant e^{1/4} 2^{1/12} A^{ - 3} \approx 0.6450  as n\rightarrow\infty, where A is the 




Glaisher-Kinkelin constant



.




Properties



The Hilbert matrix is 
symmetric and 
positive definite.


The determinant can be expressed in 
closed form, as a special case of the 
Cauchy determinant.  The Hilbert matrix is also 
totally positive (meaning the determinant of every 
submatrix is positive).  The 
inverse can also be expressed in closed form; its entries are




(H^{-1})_{ij}=(-1)^{i+j}(i+j-1){n+i-1 \choose n-j}{n+j-1 \choose n-i}{i+j-2 \choose i-1}^2


where n is the order of the matrix. It follows that the entries of the inverse matrix are all integer.


The 
condition number grows as O((1+\sqrt{2})^{4n}/\sqrt{n}).

Publications established in 1969
Chinese-language newspapers (Traditional Chinese)
Newspapers published in Hong Kong




This article is about the newspaper in Hong Kong.  For the newspaper in Malaysia, see 






Oriental Daily News (Malaysia)





.  



Oriental Daily News' logo



Oriental Daily News (
traditional Chinese:      

Jyutping
: dung1 fong1 jat6 bou3) is a 

Chinese
 
newspaper in 

Hong Kong
. It was established in 
1969. It is one of the two newspapers published by the Oriental Press Group Limited (          

Jyutping
: dung1 fong1 bou3 jip6 zaap6 tyun4 jau5 haan6 gung1 si1), found by Ma's Family. 

The founder of the newspaper was accused of committing heroin trades and series of corruptions in 70s by Hong Kong government, earning him the moniker 'White Powder'. He fled to Taiwan and never returned to Hong Kong. 


In 
1999, the newspaper was found guilty of  scandalizing the court , an extremely rare 
criminal charge that the 
newspaper's conduct would undermine confidence in the administration of justice 
http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICHRL/1999/12.html.  The charge was brought after the newspaper had 
published abusive articles challenging the 
judiciary's integrity and accusing it of bias in a 
lawsuit the paper had instigated over a photo of a 
pregnant 



Faye Wong


. The paper had also arranged for paparazzi to track a 
judge for 72 hours, to provide the judge with first-hand experience with what 
paparazzi do.


While Oriental Daily targets at a more mature reader group, 
Sun Daily (    

Jyutping
: taai3 joeng4 bou3) is more youthful and adventurous. 


Oriental Daily is referred by many as a 
tabloid because of its focus on soft news, i.e. news that edges towards entertainment in its form and content. It also adopts a sensational and critical style when reporting hard news.


The paper has been number one in circulation since 1976, with a record readership of over 3,100,000. 

Apple Daily
 is its main competitor. 



Content







The paper does not differ greatly from other Chinese papers in terms of content.  The newspaper provides daily coverage of various kinds of news, including local, international, financial, real estate, entertainment,and sports news. Information on horse-racing, soccer gambling, fashion trends and travel are also provided. 


The Oriental Daily is credited for a couple of breakthroughs. In 1977, it was the first local paper to launch a complaint page. These complaints could be against both public agencies (including governmental departments) and private companies. Readers can phone, fax or even complain through the internet using realtime conference system. If the reporters find the complaints interesting, they investigate and report them, acting as a sort of 
ombudsman for their readers. This has contributed to local newspaper's role as an influential channel for citizens to express their ideas and articulate their antipathy.  


The complaint page also reports on the response from the target of the complaints. It thus tries to stay neutral and fair, aiming only to arouse public awareness on the issues.


Facing keen competition, Oriental Daily tries hard to keep up with the city's pace. For instance, new columns like 'new arrivals' postbox' were set up to accommodate the needs of 
mainland readers.  A new soccer gambling page was also launched, with information on current 
odds.


Its 
editorial is one of a kind. It has two editorial everyday. The first one is called the 'Main Editorial' (  ), which is styled like a typical newspaper editorial. The second one is called 'Kung Fu Tea' (   ), which is written in the 
vernacular form of 





Cantonese




, is a daily critic of the misfits of the 
bureaucracy and reflecting the concerns of the grassroot population of Hong Kong.









Internet service



Oriental Daily, like many newspapers, has its own website. It provides readers free access to full version, up-to-date news. However, it only covers news of the day but not past issues. 


Readers can, too, send e-mails instead of posting letters to editors. An electronic message board is out there to record their discussions.


Orisun.com is the flagship website of the Oriental Press Group Limited. It was started in February 
2002, and includes e-paper versions of Oriental Daily and Sun Daily. The whole printed version is uploaded onto the web allowing people from all over the world to read. This helps promote online newspaper viewing. However, one point to note is that readers have to register and pay to subscribe to the e-papers. This is 'personal information as commodity', as readers need to provide personal information.




Competition and new developments



Apple Daily, established in 1995, is the paper's main competitor. They declared a price war against each other in December 
1995. Apple Daily reduced its price to 
HKD$4 dollars. To retain its market share, Oriental Daily responded by reducing the price of newspaper to $2 dollars. During and after this war, six newspapers closed down due to persistent losses, driving out competitors such as Hong Kong Daily News, Sing Pao Daily News and Tin Tin News. The competition has led to changes in the paper's presentation, with more use of colorful photos and illustrations.


Competition also improved service quality, such as the introduction of customer service centres. Readers can report their complaints by visiting these centres in 


Tsim Sha Tsui

 and 
Wan Chai. Inside the centre, complaints can be lodged face-to-face to reporters via a digital video conversation system.


Recently, Oriental Press Group Limited would like to extend its business to America and Canada. Cities like New York and Toronto which have high population of Chinese will be its first target.




Contribution to society



Since 
1980, Oriental Daily has contributed to society through the Oriental Daily Foundation. The foundation has helped thousands through financial assistance and scholarships. The paper's great number of donors promises a stable source of funding for the foundation. During the 










SARS outbreak









, the fund helped several newly-orphaned children, providing the finances to meet basic needs and continue their education.


In 2002, the fund raised over eleven million dollars. The cumulative amount collected since 1980 has exceeded $350 million dollars.

Seals (mechanical)




For more uses of the word labyrinth, see 
Labyrinth (disambiguation).






A simple labyrinth seal





A labyrinth seal is a 
mechanical seal that fits around an 
axle to prevent the leakage of oil or other fluids.   


A labyrinth seal is composed of many 
straight threads that press tightly inside another axle, or inside a hole, so that the fluid has to pass through a long and difficult path to escape. Sometimes 'threads' exist on the outer and inner portion. These interlock, to produce the long characteristic path to slow leakage. For labyrinth seals on a rotating shaft, a very small clearance must exist between the tips of the labyrinth threads and the running surface.


Labyrinth seals on rotating shafts provide non-contact sealing action by controlling the passage of fluid through a variety of chambers by centrifugal motion, as well as by the formation of controlled fluid vortices.  At higher speeds, centrifugal motion forces the liquid towards the outside and therefore away from any passages.  Similarly, if the labyrinth chambers are correctly designed, any liquid that has escaped the main chamber, becomes entrapped in a labyrinth chamber, where it is forced into a vortex-like motion.  This acts to prevent its escape, and also acts to repel any other fluid. Because these labyrinth seals are non-contact, they do not wear out.



Turbines use labyrinth seals due to the lack of friction, which is necessary for high rotational speeds.  


Labyrinth seals are also found on pistons, which use them to store oil and seal against combustion explosions, as well as on other non-rotating shafts. In these applications, it is the long and difficult path and the formation of controlled fluid vortices plus some limited contact-sealing action that creates the seal.

After the annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940, although only Estonian names were used in Russian, the use of Russian languages sources meant that some incorrect back-transliterations were used (e.g., Vilyandi, Pylva rather the correct Viljandi, Polva).

A dinner of roast beef, potatoes, and 
green beans



Roast beef is a cut of 
beef which is 
roasted in an 
oven. Roast beef is often served within sandwiches and sometimes is used to make 
hash. In 

England
, 

Ireland
, 

Canada
, and 

Australia
 roast beef is one of the meats traditionally served at 
Sunday Dinner. A traditional side dish to roast beef is 











Yorkshire pudding










.



In culture


In 
Europe, the 

English
 are particularly associated with 
beef-eating, which is why the 

French
 call them les rosbifs (the roast beefs) (see also 





Alternative words for British




). Another theory for the derivation of this name is a French mockery of the English: being relatively fair in comparison to the French, they easily get sunburned, resulting in red skin. The British reciprocally call the French  frogs , thought by many to be on account of the French dish of 
frog legs. 


According to research carried out by the 

Museum of London
 amongst 
Roman 
rubbish dumps in 

London
, it seems that Britons acquired their first taste of roast beef from the 

Roman
 military as the city expanded under their occupation.  Despite this, it seems not to have become popular amongst the population in general until the 
Middle Ages or later, and only became a 'national 
caricature' in the 18th century.1 





William Shakespeare




 suggests a reputation of the English to gorge on beef, when in the play 







Henry V






, act 3, scene 7, before the 

Battle of Agincourt
 he has the 




Constable of France



 say 


  Give them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .2






Cooking



Roast beef is traditionally served  rare  or  pink  meaning that the centre of the joint is warmed, but not cooked so that it retains the red colour of raw beef. It should be noted however that there are health concerns associated with the consumption of raw meat.3

Analytic number theory
Modular forms
Special functions
Moduli theory




In 
mathematics, a modular form is a (complex) 
analytic function on the 
upper half-plane satisfying a certain kind of 
functional equation and growth condition. The theory of modular forms therefore belongs to 
complex analysis but the main importance of the theory has traditionally been in its connections with 
number theory. Modular forms appear in other areas, such as 
algebraic topology and 
string theory. 

A modular function is a modular form of weight 0: it is invariant under the 
modular group, instead of transforming in a prescribed way, and is thus a function on the modular region (rather than a section of a 
line bundle).


Modular form theory is a special case of the more general theory of 
automorphic forms, and therefore can now be seen as just the most concrete part of a rich theory of 
discrete groups.



As a function on lattices



A modular form can be thought of as a function F from the set of 
lattices  Lambda; in C to the set of 
complex numbers which satisfies certain conditions:




(1) If we consider the lattice \Lambda = \langle \alpha, z\rangle generated by a constant  alpha; and a variable z, then F( Lambda;) is an 
analytic function of z.




(2) If  alpha; is a non-zero 
complex number and  alpha; Lambda; is the lattice obtained by multiplying each element of  Lambda; by  alpha;, then F( alpha; Lambda;) =  alpha; minus;kF( Lambda;) where k is a constant (typically a positive integer) called the weight of the form.




(3) The 
absolute value of F( Lambda;) remains bounded above as long as the absolute value of the smallest non-zero element in  Lambda; is bounded away from 0.


When k = 0, condition 2 says that F depends only on the 
similarity class of the lattice.  This is a very important special case, but the only modular forms of weight 0 are the constants.  If we eliminate condition 3 and allow the function to have poles, then weight 0 examples exist: they are called modular functions.


The situation can be profitably compared to that which arises in the search for functions on the 
projective space P(V): in that setting, one would ideally like functions F on the vector space V which are polynomial in the coordinates of v ne; 0 in V and satisfy the equation F(cv) = F(v) for all non-zero c.  Unfortunately, the only such functions are constants.  If we allow denominators (rational functions instead of polynomials), we can let F be the ratio of two 
homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. Alternatively, we can stick with polynomials and loosen the dependence on c, letting F(cv) = ckF(v).  The solutions are then the homogeneous polynomials of degree k.  On the one hand, these form a finite dimensional vector space for each k, and on the other, if we let k vary, we can find the numerators and denominators for constructing all the rational functions which are really functions on the underlying projective space P(V).


One might ask, since the homogeneous polynomials are not really functions on P(V), what are they, geometrically speaking?  The 
algebro-geometric answer is that they are sections of a 
sheaf (one could also say a 
line bundle in this case).  The situation with modular forms is precisely analogous.




As a function on elliptic curves



Every lattice  Lambda; in C determines an 
elliptic curve C/ Lambda; over C; two lattices determine 
isomorphic elliptic curves if and only if one is obtained from the other by multiplying by some  alpha;.  Modular functions can be thought of as functions on the 
moduli space of isomorphism classes of complex elliptic curves.  For example, the 
j-invariant of an elliptic curve, regarded as a function on the set of all elliptic curves, is modular.  Modular forms can also be profitably approached from this geometric direction, as sections of line bundles on the moduli space of elliptic curves.


To convert a modular form F into a function of a single complex variable is easy.  Let z = x + iy, where y  gt; 0, and let f(z) = F(1, z gt;).  (We cannot allow y = 0 because then 1 and z will not generate a lattice, so we restrict attention to the case that y is positive.)  Condition 2 on F now becomes the 
functional equation




f\left({az+b\over cz+d}\right) = (cz+d)^k f(z)


for a, b, c, d integers with ad  minus; bc = 1 (the 
modular group).  For example,




f(-1/z) = F(\langle 1,-1/z\rangle) = z^k F(\langle z,-1\rangle) = z^k F(\langle 1,z\rangle) = z^k f(z).


Functions which satisfy the modular functional equation for all matrices in a finite index subgroup of SL2(Z) are also counted as modular, usually with a qualifier indicating the group.  Thus modular forms of level N (see below) satisfy the functional equation for matrices congruent to the identity matrix modulo N (often in fact for a larger group given by (mod N) conditions on the matrix entries.)




Modular functions


In 
mathematics, modular functions are certain kinds of 
mathematical functions mapping 
complex numbers to complex numbers. There are a number of other uses of the term  modular function  as well; see below for details.


Formally, a function f is called modular or a modular function 
iff it satisfies the following properties:





 f is 
meromorphic in the open 
upper half-plane H.


 For every 
matrix M in the 
modular group  Gamma;, f(M tau;) = f( tau;).


 The 
Fourier series of f has the form






f(\tau) = \sum_{n=-m}^\infty a(n) e^{2i\pi n\tau}.

It is bounded below; it is a 
Laurent polynomial in e^{2i\pi \tau}, so it is meromorphic at the cusp.


It can be shown that every modular function can be expressed as a 
rational function of 
Klein's absolute invariant j( tau;), and that every rational function of j( tau;) is a modular function; furthermore, all 
analytic modular functions are 
modular forms, although the converse does not hold. If a modular function f is not identically 0, then it can be shown that the number of zeroes of f is equal to the number of 
poles of f in the 
closure of the 
fundamental region R Gamma;.



 Other uses 



There are a number of other usages of the term modular function, apart from this classical one; for example, in the theory of 

Haar measure
s, it is a function  Delta;(g) determined by the conjugation action.





General definitions



Let N be a positive integer. The 
modular group  Gamma;0(N) is defined as




\Gamma_0(N) = \left\{ 
\begin{pmatrix} a   b \\ c   d \end{pmatrix} \in SL_2(\mathbf{Z}) :
c \equiv 0 \pmod{N} \right\}.


Let k be a positive integer. An modular form of weight k with level N (or level group \Gamma_0(N)) is a 
holomorphic function f on the 
upper half-plane such that for any 




\begin{pmatrix} a   b \\ c   d \end{pmatrix} \in \Gamma_0(N)


and any z in the 
upper half-plane, we have





f\left(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right) = (cz+d)^k f(z)



and f is 
meromorphic at the 
cusp.  By  meromorphic at the cusp , it is meant that the modular form is meromorphic as z\rightarrow i\infty. 


Note that f\left(z+1\right) = f(z), so modular forms are periodic, with period 1, and thus have a Fourier series.



q-expansion


The q-expansion1 
of a modular form is the Laurent series at the cusp. Equivalently, the 
Fourier series, written as a 
Laurent series in terms of q=\exp(2\pi iz) (the square of the 
nome).


Since \exp is non-vanishing, q \neq 0 on the complex plane, but in the limit, \exp(w) \to 0 as w \to -\infty (along the negative real axis), so q \to 0 as 2\pi iz \to -\infty, so as z \to i\infty (along the positive imaginary axis)   thus the q-expansion is the Laurent series expansion at the cusp.


 Meromorphic at the cusp  means that only finitely many negative Fourier coefficients are non-zero, so the q-expansion is bounded below, and meromorphic at q=0:


f(z)=\sum_{n=-m}^\infty c_n \exp(2\pi inz) = \sum_{n=-m}^\infty c_n q^n.

The coefficients c_n are the Fourier coefficients of f,
and the number m is the order of the pole of f at i\infty.




Entire forms, cusp forms


If f is 
holomorphic at the cusp (has no pole at q=0), it is called an entire modular form.


If f is meromorphic but not holomorphic at the cusp, it is called non-entire modular form. For example, the 
j-invariant is a non-entire modular form of weight 0, and has a simple pole at i\infty.


If f is entire and vanishes at q=0 (so c_0=0), the form is called a 
cusp form (Spitzenform in German). The smallest n such that c_n \ne 0 is the order of the zero of f at i\infty.




Automorphic factors and other generalizations


Other common generalizations allow the weight k to not be an integer, and allow a multiplier \epsilon(a,b,c,d) with \left|\epsilon(a,b,c,d)\right|=1 to appear in the transformation, so that



f\left(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right) = \epsilon(a,b,c,d) (cz+d)^k f(z).



Functions of the form \epsilon(a,b,c,d) (cz+d)^k are known as 
automorphic factors.


By allowing automorphic factors, functions such as the 
Dedekind eta function may be encompassed by the theory, being a modular form of weight 1/2. Thus, for example, let \chi be a 
Dirichlet character mod N.  A modular form of weight k, level N (or level group \Gamma_0(N)) with nebentypus \chi is a 
holomorphic function f on the 
upper half-plane such that for any 




\begin{pmatrix} a   b \\ c   d \end{pmatrix} \in \Gamma_0(N)


and any z in the 
upper half-plane, we have





f\left(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right) = \chi(d)(cz+d)^k f(z)



and f is 
holomorphic at the 
cusp. Sometimes the convention




\chi^{-1}(d) (cz+d)^k f(z) 


is used for the 
right hand side of the above equation.





 Examples 



The simplest examples from this point of view are the 




Eisenstein series



.  For each even integer k  gt; 2, we define Ek( Lambda;) to be the sum of  lambda; minus;k over all non-zero vectors  lambda; of  Lambda;:




E_k(\Lambda) = \sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda-0}\lambda^{-k}.


The condition k  gt; 2 is needed for convergence; the condition that k is even prevents  lambda; minus;k from cancelling with ( minus; lambda;) minus;k.


An 
even unimodular lattice L in Rn is a lattice generated by n vectors forming the columns of a matrix of determinant 1 and satisfying the condition that the square of the length of each vector in L is an even integer.  As a consequence of the 


Poisson summation formula

, the 
theta function




\vartheta_L(z) = \sum_{\lambda\in L}e^{\pi i \Vert\lambda\Vert^2 z} 


is a modular form of weight n/2.  It is not so easy to construct even unimodular lattices, but here is one way:  Let n be an integer divisible by 8 and consider all vectors v in Rn such that 2v has integer coordinates, either all even or all odd, and such that the sum of the coordinates of v is an even integer.  We call this lattice Ln.  When n=8, this is the lattice generated by the roots in the 
root system called 
E8.  
Because there is only one modular form of weight 8 up to scalar multiplication,




\vartheta_{L_8\times L_8}(z) = \vartheta_{L_{16}}(z),


even though the lattices L8 times;L8 and L16
are not similar.  


John Milnor

 observed that the 16-dimensional 
tori obtained by dividing R16 by these two lattices are consequently examples of 
compact 


Riemannian manifold

s which are 
isospectral but not 
isometric (see 
Hearing the shape of a drum.)


The 
Dedekind eta function is defined as




\eta(z) = q^{1/24}\prod_{n=1}^\infty (1-q^n),\ q = e^{2\pi i z}.


Then the 
modular discriminant  Delta;(z)= eta;(z)24 is a modular form of weight 12.  A celebrated conjecture of 
Ramanujan asserted that the qp coefficient for any prime p has absolute value  le;2p11/2. This was settled by 








Pierre Deligne







 as a result of his work on the 






Weil conjectures





.


The second and third examples give some hint of the connection between modular forms and classical questions in number theory, such as representation of integers by 
quadratic forms and the 
partition function.  The crucial conceptual link between modular forms and number theory are furnished by the 
theory of 




Hecke operator



s, which also gives the link between the theory of modular forms and 
representation theory.




 Generalizations 



There are various notions of modular form more general than the one discussed above.  The assumption of complex analyticity can be dropped; 
Maass forms are 


real-analytic

 
eigenfunctions of the 
Laplacian but need not be 
holomorphic.  Groups which are not subgroups of SL2(Z) can be considered.  




Hilbert modular form



s are functions in n variables, each a complex number in the upper half-plane, satisfying a modular relation for 2 times;2 matrices with entries in a 
totally real number field.  




Siegel modular form



s are associated to larger 
symplectic groups in the same way in which the forms we have discussed are associated to SL2(R); in other words, they are related to 
abelian varieties in the same sense that our forms (which are sometimes called elliptic modular forms to emphasize the point) are related to elliptic curves. 

Automorphic form
s extend the notion of modular forms to general 
Lie groups.




History


The theory of modular forms was developed in three or four periods: first in connection with the theory of 
elliptic functions, in the first part of the 
nineteenth century; then by 


Felix Klein

 and others towards the end of the nineteenth century as the automorphic form concept became understood (for one variable); then by 





Erich Hecke




 from about 1925; and then in the 1960s, as the needs of number theory and the formulation of the 
modularity theorem in particular made it clear that modular forms are deeply implicated. 


The term modular form, as a systematic description, is usually attributed to Hecke. Curiously, 

G. H. Hardy
 is said to have banned it in his circle of students; for example, the deep studies made on the particular 
cusp form highlighted by 


Srinivasa Ramanujan

 often do not use the modern term.

Mathematical terminology




Without loss of generality (abbreviated to WLOG or WOLOG and less commonly stated as without any loss of generality) is a frequently used expression in 
mathematics. The term is used before an assumption in a proof which narrows the premise to some special case; it is implied that the proof on this subset can be easily applied to all others (or that all other cases are trivial). Thus, given a proof of the special case, it is trivial to show that the conclusions follow from the full premise.

This often requires the presence of symmetry.  For example, if two numbers are called x, y, and it is known that x  y, then any relationship proved based on this assumption will hold for the complementary relation, y  x, because the roles of x and y are interchanged, but the proof is symmetric in the two variables.  In other words, if we know that P(x, y) is true 
if and only if P(y, x) is true, then without loss of generality it is enough to show P(x, y) is true (since P(y, x) then immediately follows, by symmetry).  (In this context, we call P 
symmetric.)


Next to WLOG there must be present an assumption.  To check that there is no loss of generality, write out the entire proof (without making the simplifying assumption) and then see if the proof which you wrote out follows out of a proof of just a part of the premise.



 Example 



Consider the following 
theorem (the simplest case of 




Ramsey's theorem



 and also an example of 
Dirichlet's 
pigeonhole principle): 


Three objects are each painted either red or blue; there must be two objects of the same color. 


The proof: 


Assume without loss of generality that the first object is red. If either of the other two objects is red, we are finished; if not, the other two objects must both be blue and we are still finished.  


We begin the full proof by listing all the permutations, separating those with R first from those with B first:





 RRR


 RRB


 RBR


 RBB


 BRR (inverse of #4)


 BRB (inverse of #3)


 BBR (inverse of #2)


 BBB (inverse of #1)




of which there are eight, as we expect (2  times; 2  times; 2).    We now see that the separated lists are equivalent under our assumptions (the first half can be converted to the second half by converting all Rs to Bs and vice versa), so we can apply our analysis to the simpler half-list of permutations beginning with R.


We scan the shorter list (permutations 1-4) and see that there are two objects of the same color in every case.  In permutations 1-3, at least one object beyond the first is red, and in permutation 4 both of the non-first objects are blue.


We reduced the premise as we did by noticing, first, that the order of the objects doesn't matter; second, that we are interested not in the kind of color but in its count.  Both assumptions are consistent with our conclusion, which required that two objects be of the same color -- a loose requirement.

Monetary theory (known also as money/macro theory) is a major branch of 
macroeconomics and a framework of analysis that deals with 
monetary systems and their effect on equilibrium with production, employment and the level of prices within a macroeconomy.1 In its own definition, it deals with the difference between  broad money , typically non-circulating currency such as deposit certificates and 
treasury bills and  shallow money  that circulates amongst the population of an economy. Within monetary theory, the problems and benefits between these monies are compared using  spending  and  goods-against-goods  (
Say's Law) 2approaches, each of which stipulate the socio-economic repercussions when one approach dominates the market over the other in varying degrees.


 The current state of monetary theory 


Since 1990, the classical form of monetarism has been questioned because of events which many economists have interpreted as being inexplicable in monetarist terms, namely the unhinging of the money supply growth from inflation in the 1990s and the failure of pure monetary policy to stimulate the economy in the 2001-2003 period. 

Alan Greenspan
, former chairman of the 
Federal Reserve, argued that the 1990s decoupling was explained by a 
virtuous cycle of productivity and investment on one hand, and a certain degree of  
irrational exuberance  in the investment sector. Economist 


Robert Solow

 of MIT suggested that the 2001-2003 failure of the expected economic recovery should be attributed not to monetary policy failure but to the breakdown in productivity growth in crucial sectors of the economy, most particularly retail trade. He noted that five sectors produced all of the productivity gains of the 1990s, and that while the growth of retail and wholesale trade produced the smallest growth, they were by far the largest sectors of the economy experiencing net increase of productivity.  2% may be peanuts, but being the single largest sector of the economy, that's an awful lot of peanuts.

Afghanistan suffers during the year from the effects of the great

June 9

 

Amanullah changes his title from amir to padshah ( king ).




August 31

 
A treaty of neutrality and mutual nonaggression between Afghanistan and the 



Soviet Union


 is concluded. The first clause in the treaty provides for  neutrality in the event of an armed conflict between either of the parties with a third power , while in another clause each party agrees  not to permit in its territory the activities of elements having for their object hostile action against the other party to the treaty . This treaty is the beginning for Afghanistan of closer relations with Russia, and is followed by a  treaty of friendship  concluded on September 14, and by negotiations for an Afghan-Soviet trade agreement. These steps do not improve Afghanistan's relations with the Indian government, which is already looking with suspicion on some of its military activities; so much so that in August Mr. Yunus, the secretary of the Afghan legation in London, thought it necessary to send a communication to The Times stating that the number of Afghanistan's aeroplanes was too small to cause any apprehension, and that the Russians engaged in the air service were employed as pilots or mechanics in the same way as any other Europeans.

Queercore is a cultural and social movement that began in the mid-1980s as an offshoot of 
punk. It is distinguished by a discontent with society in general and a complete disavowal of the 
gay and 
lesbian community and its   oppressive agenda.  1 Queercore expresses itself in 
DIY style through 
zines, music, writing, art and film.


As a 
musical genre, it may be distinguished by lyrics exploring themes of prejudice and dealing with issues such as 
sexual identity, 
gender identity and the rights of the individual; more generally bands offer a critique of society endemic to their position within it, sometimes in a light-hearted way, sometimes seriously. Musically, many queercore bands originated in the 
punk scene but the 

industrial music culture
 has been influential as well. Queercore groups encompass many genres such as 
hardcore punk, 
synthpunk, 
indie rock, 
power pop, 
no wave, 
noise, 
experimental, 
industrial and others.



History













J.D.s









, created by 
G.B. Jones and 


























Bruce LaBruce

























, is widely acknowledged as being the zine which launched the movement.  J.D.s is seen by many to be the catalyst that pushed the queercore scene into existence,  writes Amy Spencer in  2. At first the editors of J.D.s had chosen the appellation  
homocore  to describe the movement but replaced the word homo with 
queer to better reflect the diversity of the scene as well as to disassociate themselves completely from the confines of gay and lesbian orthodoxy.3 The first issue was released in 1985, with a manifesto entitled  Don't Be Gay  published in the 
fanzine 
Maximum RocknRoll following soon after; inspiring, among many other zines, 
Holy Titclamps, edited by 
Larry-bob, 
 Homocore by 

Tom Jennings
 and 









Deke Nihilson








, 







Donna Dresch






's Chainsaw, and Outpunk by 
Matt Wobensmith, these last two later functioning as music labels. These zines, and the movement, are characterised by an alternative to the self-imposed ghettoization of orthodox gay men and lesbians; sexual and gender diversity in opposition to the segregation practiced by the mainstream gay community; a dissatisfaction with a 
consumerist culture, proposing a 
DIY ethos in its place in order to create a culture of its own; and opposition to oppressive religious tenets and political repression.




1990s


In 1990, the J.D.s editors released the first queercore compilation, J.D.s Top Ten Homocore Hit Parade Tape, a 
cassette which included bands from Canada, such as 



Fifth Column


; 

Nikki Parasite
 and 

Bomb
 from the U.S.; from England, 



The Apostles


, 

Academy 23
 and 
No Brain Cells; and, from New Zealand, 
Gorse. During this period of queercore in the late 1980s to the early 1990s, many of the 
punk rock bands involved were not necessarily queer but their ethics were motivation for supporting this movement. Other bands, such as 



Los Crudos


 and 

Go!
, had one queer and outspoken member. The sexuality of band members has never been an issue in the choice to align oneself with the queercore movement or not.


Other early queercore bands included 



Anti-Scrunti Faction


, who appeared in J.D.s, and 
Comrades In Arms, Homocore editor Deke Nihilson's band. Shortly after the release of the tape J.D.s ceased publication and a new crop of zines arose, such as Jane and Frankie by Klaus and 
Jena von Brucker, Shrimp by 


















Vaginal Davis

















 and 
Fanorama by REB. The zine BIMBOX published statements such as  BIMBOX hereby renounces it's [sic] past use of the term lesbian and/or gay in a positive manner. This is a civil war against the ultimate evil, and consequently we must identify us and them in no uncertain terms, a task which will prove to be half the battle.  1The first queer zine gathering occurred at this time;  Spew , held in 

Chicago
 in 1991, offered an opportunity for all those involved in the scene to meet. Although organizer 
Steve LaFreniere was stabbed outside the venue at the end of the night, he quickly recovered and the event was deemed a success.4 Spew 2 took place in 
Los Angeles in 19925
, and Spew III in 

Toronto
 in 1993.  These Spew events also included musical performances by queercore bands.


Among the better known bands from the early 1990s are 



Fifth Column


, 

God Is My Co-Pilot
, 


Pansy Division

, 
PME, 

Sister George
, 



Team Dresch


, 



Tribe 8


, 
Mukilteo Fairies, and 
Extra Fancy. As these bands gained popularity and awareness of the movement grew, zines began appearing from around the world; The Burning Times from Australia, P.M.S. from the UK, 
Speed Demon from Italy, and Brazilian e-zine 
Queercore, these last two still on-going, are just a few examples.


In 

Chicago
, 
Mark Freitas and Joanna Brown organized a monthly  Homocore  night that featured queercore bands performing live, offering a stable venue for the scene to proliferate; most of the bands mentioned played at Homocore Chicago. As well, as Amy Spencer notes in DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture,  Through Homocore events, they aimed to create a space for men and women to be together, as opposed to the sense of gender segregation which was the norm in mainstream gay culture - They attacked the idea that due to your sexuality you should be offered only one choice of social scene...  6


In 1992 Matt Wobensmith's zine 






Outpunk





 also became a record label, and began to release its own queercore compilations, singles, and albums, and was crucial to the development of queercore. The first recordings by Tribe 8 and Pansy Division were released by the label. Some of the bands appearing later in the mid-1990s on the label include 

Sta-Prest
, 



Cypher in the Snow


 and 
Behead the Prophet, No Lord Shall Live.


It was also at this time in the early 1990s that 

Riot Grrrl
 emerged.  In many ways the angry- girl genre owes its existence to punk homocore 'zines..  writes Emily White in Rock She Wrote. It follows that many of the participants, their zines and bands like 

Excuse 17
 were involved in both movements 7. Along with Outpunk, 
independent record labels such as 

Alternative Tentacles
, 

K Records
, 

Kill Rock Stars
, 

Lookout! Records
, 
Yoyo Recordings and 

Candy Ass Records
 also supported and released material by queercore artists but in the mid to late 1990s several other small labels sprung up solely devoted to queercore.


Donna Dresch's zine 

Chainsaw
 became a record label as well, and began to release recordings by newer bands such as 



The Need


, 
The Third Sex and 

Longstocking
. 
Heartcore Records is another label, whose bands have included 


The Little Deaths

, 
Addicted2Fiction, 
Crowns On 45 and 
Ninja Death Squad. These bands, many of whom are no longer together, constituted  the 'second wave' of queercore bands which also included 
IAMLoved, 
Subtonix, 

Best Revenge
 and 
Fagatron from the U.S., 
Skinjobs from Canada and, from Italy, 
Pussy Face. Of these early queercore labels, Chainsaw and Heartcore are still active and are still releasing new material.


By the mid 1990s, zines in the U.S., such as Marilyn Medusa, and in Canada, This Is The Salivation Army, began to link queercore with a 
pagan sensibility3; at the same time, other strands in queercore began to link themselves with Riot Grrrl, and still others with 
anarchism. Mainstream media coverage intensified when Pansy Division toured the U.S. with 





Green Day




, but nonetheless, queercore remained a grassroots movement in flux. In 1996 in 
San Francisco, the Dirtybird 96 Queercore Festival presaged other queer music gatherings which occurred in the following decade 8. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, 

DUMBA
 provided an ongoing venue in 





New York




 for  queercore bands 9, continuing in the path of Homocore Chicago and leading the way for other, similar clubs to come in the 2000s.




2000s


In the 2000s, queercore club nights and events continued to take place throughout Europe and North America. In Los Angeles' Silver Lake neighbourhood an underground queer music scene was in existence at the monthly queercore club called  The Freak Show  hosted by the leather bar The Gauntlet II for three years, where bands such as Best Revenge and IAMLoved played regularly.  In Toronto, the queercore scene thrived for a number of years at the monthly club Vazaleen, or Club V, run by Will Munro, which featured bands from across the U.S.A and Canada, including such legendary performers as 






Jayne County





. The festival 
Queer Panic was organized by 
Gordon Gordon of the zine 
Teen Fag in 

Seattle, Washington
 in June of 2000. 
Scutterfest was organized by 
Rudy Bleu of the zine 
Scutter in 

Los Angeles, California
 in 2001, 2002, and 2003.  
The Bent Festival was held in Seattle in 2002 and 2003.


The festival 
Homo-a-go-go was held the summers of 2002, 2004 and 2006 in 

Olympia, Washington
, featuring queer films, zines, performance and musical groups during the week-long event. 
Queeruption, which takes place in a different city each year, has been hosted by Berlin, Rome, New York and London in the past. In 2004 and 2005, a group of queercore bands toured throughout the U.S.; the tour was called Queercore Blitz and was yet another way to connect the like-minded. Queer groups that are flourishing now in the UK are 
Queers Without Borders, 
Queer Mutiny North, 
Cardiff Queer Mutiny, 
Queer Mutiny Brighton.  A number of these are organised as 
Queer Mutiny groups.   
16 records is a queercore label that releases albums by such Pacific Northwest bands as 
Shemo, 
The Haggard, and 



Swan Island


, as well as the Brazilian band 
Dominatrix.  In 2002, 






Agitprop! Records





 released a compilation titled Stand Up   Fucking Fight For It, which collected new music from queercore bands.  It was the first release from the label, which features many queercore acts in its roster.


Queercore became increasingly an international phenomenon in the early 2000s, with bands such as 
Low End Models and 
Rhythm King And Her Friends from 

Germany
, 
Kids Like Us out of 



Norway


 and 

She Devils
, from 


Argentina

. From Toronto, Canada, 

Kids on TV
, with an industrial background, offer a new, more electronic direction for queercore, as do 



Lesbians on Ecstasy


 in 

Montreal
, and 

Gravy Train!!!!
, an 
electropop band from 

California
. 

The Hidden Cameras
 are an 
anti-folk band from Toronto.3 Representing a more contemporary breed of 
hardcore punk are the 
straight edge band 

Limp Wrist
 from the United States. 

Three Dollar Bill
 from Chicago are more eclectic, ranging from punk to 
indie rock to metal. Also citing metal as an inspiration is 

ASSACRE
, a one man fantasy metal/spazz noise act from 

Austin, Texas
, and 

Gay for Johnny Depp
, a thrash metal band from 





New York




. Along with these new bands, queercore pioneers Team Dresch reunited in the mid-2000s for several tours.


In the 
UK there is a burgeoning queercore scene, fuelled by afore mentioned groups such as 
Queer Mutiny, the now defunct 
Homocrime, and record labels such as 
Local Kid arranging shows and releasing records by bands such as 
The Corey Orbisons, 
Sleeping States, 
Drunk Granny, 
Little Paper Squares, 
Husbands, 
Fake Tan and 
Lianne Hall. These bands all combine elements of the DIY culture that spurred queercore and the punk sensibility. With each new band the range of musical genres expands the definition of queercore. In September 2005, writers David Ciminelli and Ken Knox published , which traced the early years of the movement in the United States and some of the contemporary musicians who have been inspired by it. The book was published by 
Alyson Books.




Influences


Influences vary for each musician, zine editor and filmmaker involved, but it is doubtful that queercore would have come into existence without the atmosphere surrounding the early punk years. Performers at that time either conspicuously played with conceptions of 
gender, such as Wayne County (now 






Jayne County





) of 

Wayne County   the Electric Chairs
, and 

Phranc
 from the aptly named 

Nervous Gender
 or, like 





Pete Shelley




 of 


Buzzcocks

, 


Darby Crash

 of 

The Germs
, members of 

The Screamers
, 
The Raped, 
The Leather Nun, 
Malaria! and other bands, were not interested in hiding their sexuality. In 1979, members of Nervous Gender told 










Slash









 magazine, ...people think we're weird cause we're queer. 


The early punk scene with its connections to artists had an inherent diversity of sexualities; 

Vivienne Westwood
 used  
homoerotic 







Tom of Finland






 imagery for her now iconic punk t-shirts and punk style incorporated 
fetish wear that, while employed to shock, also signalled acceptance to those in the know. Many artists who later came to be known as '

Industrial
' such as 


Throbbing Gristle

 and 


Coil

, employing similar shock tactics, also had queer members and were equally influential. In the seminal punk film 

Jubilee
, 

















Derek Jarman
















 captured the ambivalent and ambiguous sexuality of punk's early years.


Later, in the U.S. during the eighties when the 

Hardcore punk
 scene arose, 

The Dicks
'  
Gary Floyd was writing queer-themed songs, as were many hardcore bands, except that he, along with  







Randy Turner






 of 

Big Boys
 were both open about being homosexuals. In England, in the 
anarcho-punk scene, 
Andy Martin of 



The Apostles


 was equally forthright. Politically motivated bands such as 



MDC


 and 

7 Seconds
 in the U.S. were also introducing anti-homophobia messages into their songs at this time and , in a more personal vein, bands such as the Nip Drivers were including songs such as  Quentin , dedicated to 




Quentin Crisp



, on their albums.  However, it was the confrontational attitude and shock tactics of the punk and industrial scenes that queercore employed, rather than activism, or politics, or the mainstream approval and major label deals that gay and lesbian musicians of that time courted, since those involved in the queercore scene were not seeking the acceptance of society, be it homosexual or heterosexual, but rather to condemn it.


Filmmakers such as 



Kenneth Anger


, 

Jack Smith
, early 


Andy Warhol

 and 




John Waters



, 










Vivienne Dick









 and the aforementioned Derek Jarman were influential also, with their depictions of queer subcultures. In 1990 the editors of J.D.s began presenting J.D.s movie nights in various cities and, after the demise of J.D.s, each made films exploring the queercore milieu; Bruce LaBruce released 

No Skin Off My Ass
 in 1991; G.B. Jones' 
The Troublemakers was released in 1990, followed by 

The Yo-Yo Gang
 in 1992. In 1996, J.D.s contributor 







Anonymous Boy






 completed the first animated queercore film, 
Green Pubes.  Documentary films about queercore include the 1996 releases 
She's Real, Worse Than Queer by 










Lucy Thane









 and  by 









Scott Treleaven








. 
Gay Shame '98 by 
Scott Berry documents the first 
Gay shame event.  







Tracy Flannigan






's  was released in 2003. 2003 also saw the premiere of the 
no budget comedy 
 Malaqueerche: Queer Punk Rock Show by Sarah Adorable (of  
Scream Club) and Devon Devine, which brought the third wave of queercore to the screen. All these films impacted the scene and broadened the scope of queercore to include film as another of its mediums of expression.


As with punk, queercore culture existed outside of the mainstream so zines were crucial to its development. Hundreds of zines formed an intercontinental network that enabled queercore to spread and allow those in smaller, more repressive communities to participate. The 
DIY attitude of punk was integral to queercore as well. In the 1990s, as the availability of the 
internet increased, many queercore zines, such as Noise Queen could be found online as well as in print. The queercore zine label 
Xerox Revolutionaries run by 
Hank Revolt, was available online and distributed zines from 2000 to 2005. Queercore forums and chatrooms, such as QueerPunks started up. The 
Queer Zine Archive Project is an internet database of scanned queer zines that continues to grow. All these developments allowed queercore to become a self-sustaining and self-determined subculture, expressing itself through a variety of mediums independent of the straight and gay establishment.

For the series of Christian albums, see 
City on a Hill (series).


City upon a hill is a phrase that is associated with 

John Winthrop
's 
sermon  A Model of Christian Charity,  given in 1630. The phrase is derived from the metaphor of 
Salt and Light in the 










Sermon on the Mount









 of 



















Jesus


















 given in the 










Gospel of Matthew









. Verse fourteen of Matthew chapter five states that  you are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.  Winthrop warned the 
Puritan colonists of 


New England

 who were to found the 






Massachusetts Bay Colony





 that their new community would be a  city upon a hill,  watched by the world:



For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill.  The eyes of all people are upon us.  So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken  we shall be made a story and a by-word throughout the world.  We shall open the mouths of enemies to speak evil of the ways of God  We shall shame the faces of many of God's worthy servants, and cause their prayers to be turned into curses upon us til we be consumed out of the good land whither we are a-going.1



The speech was given aboard the 
Arbella not long before landing.


Winthrop believed that all nations had a 
covenant with God, and that because England had violated its religious covenant, the Puritans must leave the country. This was an expression of the Puritan belief that the 

Church of England
 had fallen from grace by accepting 


Catholic

 rituals. John Winthrop claimed that the Puritans forged a new, special agreement with God, like that between God and the 
people of Israel. However, unlike the Separatists (such as the 
Pilgrims), the Puritans remained nominally a part of the Anglican church in hopes that it could be purified from within. Winthrop believed that by purifying Christianity in the New World, his followers would serve as an example to the Old World for building a model 


Protestant

 community.


The Puritan's,lead by Winthrop, believed their community was 'specially ordained by God' and this concept had a powerful effect on the Puritan society of New England. Of course, breaking a covenant with God has dire results: In order to avoid incurring God's wrath by breaking their promise, the Puritans sought to maintain perfect order in their society. There institutions and conventions attempted to molded an extremely ridged society in New England, in contrast with the other loosely-bound colonies in the new land of America. 



John Winthrop's City upon a Hill, 1630 



Now the onely way to avoyde this shipwracke and to provide for our posterity is to followe the Counsell of Micah, to doe Justly, to love mercy, to walke humbly with our God, for this end, wee must be knitt together in this worke as one man, wee must entertaine each other in brotherly Affeccion, wee must be willing to abridge our selves of our superfluities, for the supply of others necessities, wee must uphold a familiar Commerce together in all meekenes, gentlenes, patience and liberallity, wee must delight in eache other, make others Condicions our owne rejoyce together, mourne together, labour, and suffer together, allwayes haveing before our eyes our Commission and Community in the worke, our Community as members of the same body, soe shall wee keepe the unitie of the spirit in the bond of peace, the Lord will be our God and delight to dwell among us, as his owne people and will commaund a blessing upon us in all our wayes, soe that wee shall see much more of his wisdome power goodnes and truthe then formerly wee have beene acquainted with, wee shall finde that the God of Israell is among us, when tenn of us shall be able to resist a thousand of our enemies, when hee shall make us a prayse and glory, that men shall say of succeeding plantacions: the lord make it like that of New England: for wee must Consider that wee shall be as a Citty upon a Hill, the eies of all people are uppon us; soe that if wee shall deale falsely with our god in this worke wee have undertaken and soe cause him to withdrawe his present help from us, wee shall be made a story and a byword through the world, wee shall open the mouthes of enemies to speake evill of the wayes of god and all professours for Gods sake; wee shall shame the faces of many of gods worthy servants, and cause theire prayers to be turned into Cursses upon us till wee be consumed out of the good land whether wee are going: And to shutt upp this discourse with that exhortacion of Moses that faithfull servant of the Lord in his last farewell to Israell Deut. 30. Beloved there is now sett before us life, and good, deathe and evill in that wee are Commaunded this day to love the Lord our God, and to love one another to walke in his wayes and to keepe his Commaundements and his Ordinance, and his lawes, and the Articles of our Covenant with him that wee may live and be multiplyed, and that the Lord our God may blesse us in the land whether wee goe to possesse it: But if our heartes shall turne away soe that wee will not obey, but shall be seduced and worshipp other Gods our pleasures, and proffitts, and serve them, it is propounded unto us this day, wee shall surely perishe out of the good Land whether wee passe over this vast Sea to possesse it; Therefore lett us choose life, that wee, and our Seede, may live; by obeyeing his voyce, and cleaveing to him, for hee is our life, and our prosperity.




Modern usage



The first modern usage was by President-Elect 


John F. Kennedy

 in a speech delivered to a 'Joint Convention of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' on January 9, 1961.
John F. Kennedy Presidential Library


Extract from Kennedy's speech:  



Allow me to illustrate: During the last sixty days, I have been at the task of constructing an administration. It has been a long and deliberate process. Some have counseled greater speed. Others have counseled more expedient tests.


But I have been guided by the standard John Winthrop set before his shipmates on the flagship Arbella three hundred and thirty-one years ago, as they, too, faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier.


 We must always consider,  he said,  that we shall be as a city upon a hill--the eyes of all people are upon us. 


Today the eyes of all people are truly upon us--and our governments, in every branch, at every level, national, state and local, must be as a city upon a hill--constructed and inhabited by men aware of their great trust and their great responsibilities


For we are setting out upon a voyage in 1961 no less hazardous than that undertaken by the Arabella in 1630. We are committing ourselves to tasks of statecraft no less awesome than that of governing the Massachusetts Bay Colony, beset as it was then by terror without and disorder within.


History will not judge our endeavors--and a government cannot be selected--merely on the basis of color or creed or even party affiliation. Neither will competence and loyalty and stature, while essential to the utmost, suffice in times such as these.


For of those to whom much is given, much is required. And when at some future date the high court of history sits in judgment on each one of us--recording whether in our brief span of service we fulfilled our responsibilities to the state--our success or failure, in whatever office we may hold, will be measured by the answers to four questions:


First, were we truly men of courage--with the courage to stand up to one's enemies--and the courage to stand up, when necessary, to one's associates--the courage to resist public pressure, as well as private greed?


Secondly, were we truly men of judgment--with perceptive judgment of the future as well as the past--of our own mistakes as well as the mistakes of others--with enough wisdom to know that we did not know, and enough candor to admit it?


Third, were we truly men of integrity--men who never ran out on either the principles in which they believed or the people who believed in them--men who believed in us--men whom neither financial gain nor political ambition could ever divert from the fulfillment of our sacred trust?


Finally, were we truly men of dedication--with an honor mortgaged to no single individual or group, and compromised by no private obligation or aim, but devoted solely to serving the public good and the national interest.


Courage--judgment--integrity--dedication--these are the historic qualities of the Bay Colony and the Bay State--the qualities which this state has consistently sent to this chamber on Beacon Hill here in Boston and to Capitol Hill back in Washington.


And these are the qualities which, with God's help, this son of Massachusetts hopes will characterize our government's conduct in the four stormy years that lie ahead.


Humbly I ask His help in that undertaking--but aware that on earth His will is worked by men. I ask for your help and your prayers, as I embark on this new and solemn journey.2



_____________________


President 



Ronald Reagan


 used the phrase on January 11th 1989, in his farewell speech to the nation:


And that's about all I have to say tonight. Except for one thing. The past few days when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the  shining city upon a hill.  The phrase comes from John Winthrop, who wrote it to describe the America he imagined. What he imagined was important because he was an early Pilgrim, an early freedom man. He journeyed here on what today we'd call a little wooden boat; and like the other Pilgrims, he was looking for a home that would be free.


I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace, a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity, and if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it and see it still.3



______________________


After the phrase was used by Ronald Reagan, the fundamentalist Christian movement in America took up the phrase   city upon a hill  as a sort of code word to describe their vision of bringing 'Christian Values' into government. 


In August 2007, Larry Witham, author and proponent of 
Intelligent Design, previously known for promoting fundamentalist Christian arguments in his books  By Design: Science and the Search for God Encounter Books  and  The Measure of God: Our Century-Long Struggle to Reconcile Science and Religion  released a new book called  City Upon a Hill: How Sermons Changed the Course of American History .4 His web site states his next book will be titled 
The Proof of God.5 


_______________________


The phrase was referenced several times during the 2008 
Republican National Convention by 


Rudy Giuliani

 and several others, during the nomination of the Republican candidate 


John McCain

. Attributing it to Ronald Reagan, the phrase was again used by 


Sarah Palin

 during the 2008 vice-presidential debate.

Beano strips




The Nibblers were 
fictional characters who had their own 
comic strip in the 











UK










 comic 







The Beano






. The Nibblers were a community of 
mice who lived in a hole in the wall, and were always stealing food from Porky, the fat owner of the house. Porky and his cat Whiskers were repeatedly foiled in their attempts to catch The Nibblers, who nearly always had the last laugh. Like 




The Bash Street Kids



, the Nibblers all had distinct personalities. Their names were:




His Nibs - the leader.


Cheddar George - fat and greedy.


Gordonzola - 
scottish mouse of 



Italian


 descent.


Enor Mouse - large and strong.


Chiseller - engineer.


Sniffler - had a useful nose.


Scritch and Scratch - small and (apart from their jerseys) identical. (cf. Snitch and Snatch in 


Lord Snooty

.)




The strip originally ran from 
1970 to 
1974. In 
1977 it was revived, and continued in the comic until 
1984. The initial run was drawn by 
Ron Spencer, and the second by 
John Sherwood.


Also in 1 strip of 


Fred's Bed

 by the 
Beano, there was a character called 'His Nibs'

Wyeth brands
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs









200mg, 50 Caplets



Advil is a brand of 
ibuprofen, an 
NSAID (
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). Advil is manufactured by Madison NJ based 

Wyeth
 and has been on the market since 1984. 



Advertising



Marketing slogans have included  Advanced Medicine for Pain  and most recently  The Every Pain Reliever .  


Throughout its history, Advil advertising often compared it to both 
aspirin and 






Tylenol





 portraying both as  old fashioned  or  out of date  drugs. For example, one print advertisement showed aspirin and Tylenol in the background with the years they came out (1898 and 1955 respectively) and Advil shown as  Today's  drug (except upon its introduction in 1984, when  1984  was shown).  Another example is a television commercial (about mid to late 1990s) showing  flashbacks  of previous generations using aspirin or Tylenol and showing Advil as being used by the current generation.





Advil PM




Advil PM became available in 2006.  It is a combination of 200 mg of 
ibuprofen and 38 mg of a sleep aid 
diphenhydramine 1 the same ingredient in 




Tylenol PM



 and 






Benadryl





.

Regular Baptists are a diverse group of 

Baptist
s in the 








United States







 and 

Canada
. The presence of the modifier  Regular  in their names attests to the strong influence of the early Regular Baptists on the growth of Baptists in 



North America


. Two strains of Baptists emigrated from 

England
 to 








America







   the 


General Baptist

s and the Particular Baptists. The near extinction of the General Baptists, coupled with the expansion of Particular Baptists, especially through the labors of the Philadelphia Baptist Association (org. 1707), probably gave rise to the Particulars becoming the Regular Baptists. Early in the 19th century, the two dominant groups of Baptists in the United States (Regular Baptists   
Separate Baptists) effected a merger and dropped their party names in favor of the appellation 
United Baptists. In spite of this, the term Regular Baptist has persisted to this day.


List of Regular Baptists


(This grouping is not to be confused with 
Reformed Baptists who hold to the 




London Baptist Confession of Faith



)




General Association of Regular Baptist Churches   organized in 1932 by conservative and fundamentalist churches withdrawing from the Northern Baptist Convention (now 
American Baptist Churches in the USA).





Association of Regular Baptist Churches

   organized in 1957; primarily composed of churches in 
Ontario, Canada; about 1500 members in 10 churches. 



Primitive Baptists   a number of Primitive Baptist churches and associations, especially in the Midwest, use the name  Regular Baptist  instead of, or in addition to the name  Primitive Baptist .





Old Regular Baptist

s   a primarily Appalachian group of churches achieving separate status late in the 19th century.





Union Baptists

   a strand of Regular Baptists that owes its origin to the 

Civil War
. Churches and associations, especially in border states, were rent asunder by this national conflict. Tensions over secession, war and reconstruction, as well as the fact that Primitive Baptists did not allow members to hold membership in secret societies, combined to incubate the Union Baptists. Many pro-Union Primitive Baptists joined Union Leagues, and were expelled from their churches and associations. The Mountain Union Association, formed in 1867, was the first  Union  Baptist association. Unlike other areas, this distinction, at least in name, has persisted, and some churches and associations consider themselves  Union Baptists . There seems to be no doctrinal distinction between Union Baptists and Regular Baptists. Three associations   Original Mountain Union, Primitive and Union   have about 3300 members in 36 churches. Mitchell River Union Baptist Association may still be in existence.


Regular Baptists   found in 5 local associations; much like the Old Regular Baptists, and located in the same region, but more open to changes in worship and lifestyle. Churches have allowed notated hymnals, Sunday Schools, revivals and even instrumental music. Three associations, mostly in 





North Carolina




, are in correspondence   Little River, Little Valley and Mountain Union (708 members in 15 churches in 1999). Two others are in isolated areas and not connected to the first three   East Washington in 

Arkansas
 (1560 members in 10 churches in 1999) and Enterprise in 





Ohio




, 





Kentucky




 and bordering areas (4288 members in 63 churches in 1999). 


Regular, Old Regular, Primitive and Union Baptists maintain the rite of 
feet washing, while the GARBC   ARBC do not.





Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada

   although the FEBCC is not generally considered Regular Baptist, some churches of this Fellowship still carry Regular Baptist as part of their name, especially in 

British Columbia
. Three of four major bodies forming and entering the FEBCC from 1953 to 1965 were Regular Baptist associations.

Peta Gia Wilson





Peta Gia Wilson (born November 18, 1970) is an 

Australia
n actress and model.



Biography



Early life


Wilson was born in 

Sydney
, 




New South Wales



, the daughter of Karlene (
nee White), a caterer, and Darcy Wilson, a former warrant officer.1 Her parents divorced in 1982. At a young age, she moved and lived a portion of her life in 

Papua New Guinea
. Living there without television or radio, she and her brother learned to entertain themselves putting on private shows for their parents lip synching to 
Liza Minnelli.  This was just a hint of her budding talent to come. Her family moved around from place to place as her father, Darcy Wilson, was in the military special forces. She learned to adapt quickly to each place she moved and was very well liked.  


During her teen years she involved herself in sports such as netball and swimming. As a very energetic young woman, her mother was concerned about her being a 
tomboy, so Peta was sent to deportment classes. While there she was spotted by a modeling agent. Her new career allowed her to live in 
Europe but Peta had other plans.




Career


First working as a model in Australia and Europe, she moved to 

Los Angeles
 where she studied acting in 1991. She studied with people like 

Arthur Mendoza
 from The 



Actors Circle Theatre


 in Los Angeles, as well as Tom Waits at the TomKat Repertory Group. She landed small roles in independent films such as Loser and One of Our Own. But in 1996, ready to pursue her acting studies in New York, she was persuaded to audition for 

USA Network
. She beat out 200 other actresses for the starring role in the 

Canadian
 television action series 
Nikita (U.S. title: La Femme Nikita) playing the role of Nikita, codenamed Josephine, a martial arts trained covert agent. The show was based on 

Nikita
, a 



Luc Besson


 movie of the same name.


The show was a successful spring board for Peta's career in fact she received two 

Gemini
 nominations for Best Performance By An Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role. 


In 2003, Wilson appeared in the movie 

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
 with 


Sean Connery

 in the role of vampire 

Mina Harker
. 
She was featured on July 2004 issue of 
Playboy magazine.


In 2006, she appeared in the film 

Superman Returns

Amitabha Buddha on the monastery grounds.

Fo Guang Shan (

Chinese
:    ; 
pinyin: Fogu ngsh n; literally  Buddha's Light Mountain ) is an international Chinese 





Mahayana




 
Buddhist monastic order that has gained a worldwide presence, and has chapters around the world. The headquarters of Fo Guang Shan, located in 

Kaohsiung
, is the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. The organisation itself is also one of the largest charity organizations in Taiwan. The order also calls itself the International Buddhist Progress Society.


Founded in 1967 by Venerable Master 









Hsing Yun








, a renowned Chinese Buddhist monk and scholar, the order promotes 






Humanistic Buddhism





, a modern Chinese Buddhist philosophy developed through the 20th Century, and made popular by this and other modern Chinese Buddhist orders. Humanistic Buddhism aims to make Buddhism relevant in the world and in people's lives and hearts. Like most modern Chinese Buddhist organizations, the ordination lineage is from the 
Rinzai 
Zen (

Chinese
:    ; 
pinyin: Linjiz ng) school. However, Fo Guang Shan declares clearly that it is an  amalgam of all Eight Schools of Chinese Buddhism  (    ), including but not limited to Pureland. In this sense, it is a monastic order, and not a doctrinal school of thought per se.



 History 







Main hall of the monastery.



In 1967, Master Hsing Yun purchased more than 30 hectares in 
Dashu Township, 

Kaohsiung
 County as the site for the construction of a monastery. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 16th.

During the time that was spent clearing the mountains, the endless toiling away, wave upon wave of physical strain, the planning that carried on into all hours of the day, the barrage of floods and other natural disasters, and the belligerent mobs that surrounded the mountain were all quite beyond description. On windy and sunny days, the workers clothes would be soaked in sweat, dried up, and then soaked up again. They would be discussing throughout the day and go to bed late at night, and then as soon as the sun came out, they would work again. However, in the momentum of an incomparable courage, and by the blood and sweat of the laborers, the vast wilderness was transformed into the scenic Fo Guang Shan that exists today. 


From 1967 and on, Fo Guang Shan embarked on many construction projects, including university buildings, shrines, and a cemetery. In 1975, Fo Guang Shan's 36-meter tall statue of Amitabha Buddha was consecrated. In 1981, 15 years after its establishment, the Great Hero Hall was built. During these times, many other FGS temples outside the order's mother monastery were also built. 


Currently, a giant tower is being built for a tooth sharira of the Buddha, which was a gift presented by Tibetan lamas in 
1998. The tower commemorates the life of the historical 


Gautama Buddha

. No recent developments have been made since the announcement to build the tower.



Temple closing


In May 1997, Hsing Yun announced that he would close the mountain gate of Fo Guang Shan to the general public. His reason in closing the monastery was to give monastics the cloistered atmosphere they need for their Buddhist practice. In practice, many Chinese monasteries have also closed their mountain gates to give a cloistered atmosphere to the temple residents.  At the end of 2000, ROC President 

Chen Shui-bian
 and government officials from 

Kaohsiung
 visited Fo Guang Shan bringing with them the wish from their constituents that Fo Guang Shan re-open its mountain gate.


After due consideration, Fo Guang Shan decided to re-open the monastery to some extent, thereby providing the public with a Pure Land environment in which to practice Buddhism.





Innovations


Fo Guang Shan today has been extraordinarily successful; in the past several decades, temples and organizations have been established on five continents in 173 countries, and now encompasses more than 3,500 monastics. Fo Guang Shan emphasizes education and service, maintaining public universities, Buddhist colleges, libraries, publishing houses, translation centres, Buddhist art galleries, teahouses, and mobile medical clinics worldwide. 


The order has also established a children's home, retirement home, high school and television station.



Social and medical programs


The social and medical programs of Fo Guang Shan include a free medical clinic with mobile units that serve remote villages, an annual winter relief program organized to distribute warm clothing and food supplies to the needy, a children's and seniors' home, wildlife conservation areas to protect living creatures, and a cemetery for the care of the deceased.




Educational programs


The educational programs of Fo Guang Shan include four Buddhist colleges, three regular college, and various community colleges. The Chinese Buddhist research institute is further subdivided into four separate departments; a women's and men's college, and an international and English Buddhist studies department. Tuition fees and lodging are provided by Fo Guang Shan, free of charge.


With the many colleges and universities, Fo Guang Shan also operates 

Pu-Men High School
 in Taipei, Jiun Tou Elementary and Junior High School, Humanities Primary and Junior High School, which provides regular curriculum for students. Fo Guang Shan also has nursery schools, 
kindergartens, and Sunday schools for children.




Religious Affairs Committee


In 1972, Master Hsing Yun established a nine member council, known as the Fo Guang Shan Religious Affairs Committee. These nine members govern the monastery and the order. The members are elected prior to the resignation, death, or the ending of a term of an abbot. Once elected by members of Fo Guang Shan, the votes are openly counted. The nine members then nominate their next abbot.



Abbots


Unlike a traditional Buddhist monastery abbot, where the incumbent selects his successor, Fo Guang Shan uses the modern ideals of 
democracy to choose the abbot. 


The abbot of Fo Guang Shan is the overall head of the order, and is the chairperson of the RAC, serving a term of six years, with one reappointment by popular vote and under exceptional circumstances, a second reappointment by two thirds of the popular vote. The abbot is elected by all members of Fo Guang Shan through public vote. The abbot-elect then begins to use their  inner name , in place of his/her own 
dharma name, with the first character being Hsin (    , xin, or heart). In fact, all monastics of Fo Guang Shan have such a name, and several Elders also use their publicly. At the beginning of the year, the abbot-elect is inaugurated as the new director of Fo Guang Shan through a 
dharma transmission ceremony, receiving the robe and bowl. 


Master Hsing Yun is the only abbot to have served as the abbot for more than two terms, and was not elected by the RAC. In the case of Venerable Hsin Ping (who was originally Venerable Zhizong), he was also not officially elected, as he was Master Hsing Yun's designated heir apparent. After Hsin Ping died, the vice director of Fo Guang Shan, Hsin Ting  (originally Venerable Zhidu), was immediately elevated to serve the remaining years of Hsin Ping's term. Abbots have been elected according to FGS's constitution since then.


Like Master Hsing Yun, on retiring, former abbots do not leave the order forever, Rather, by the end of their term of service, former abbots will go on making Dharma talks throughout the world at any time they can, and eventually become head teachers of the Order in their later years. 



Order of precedence





Venerable Tzu Chuang, pictured during an alms begging ceremony at 

Hsi Lai Temple
, is the eldest bhikkhuni in the Fo Guang Shan order. Behind her is Venerable Tzu Jung.





The Fo Guang Shan order of precedence is a sequential hierarchy of nominal importance of monks, nuns, and laity. One's position in an order of precedence is not necessarily an indication of functional importance, but rather an indication of ceremonial or historical relevance.  In particular, length of monastic ordination, a notion relevant to Buddhism as a whole.

Dharma propagation


Dharma programs of Fo Guang Shan include lectures given in prisons and factories; programs on television and radio, large-scale public lectures in Taiwan and overseas, and the 
five precepts initiation given twice a year at the monastery.


All branches of Fo Guang Shan organize pilgrimages to bring devotees to the monastery from different parts of Taiwan and overseas. Once pilgrims arrive, they are free to make use of all of the different activities that are open to the general public.




Criticism


Over the years, Fo Guang Shan has endured much criticism, primarily during their efforts to build more branch temples and establish new BLIA chapters, because some visitors felt that they were expected to give donations for this purpose. Also, some critics dispute whether some money that had been given to members of the order constituted gifts given personally to them, or donations to the organization, which requires that all donations to the order be accounted for.


Critics have also said repeatedly that branch temples of Fo Guang Shan have been noted to be huge and extravagant (such as 





Nan Tien Temple




 in Australia, 





Nan Hua Temple




 in South Africa, 
Zu Lai temple in Brazil and 

Hsi Lai Temple
 in the United States), which contradicts the Buddhist thought of not being attached to material things. The order responds by stating that modern people require modern facilities, and without these new facilities, few people would be drawn to the practice of Buddhism. The quarters of the monks and nuns themselves, are in fact very simple and unpretentious. It should also be noted that these criticisms are commonly raised with regard to many successfully modernizing Buddhist institutions.




Objectives of Fo Guang Shan





 To propagate Buddhist teachings through cultural activities


 To foster talent through education


 To benefit society through charitable programs


 To purify human hearts and minds through Buddhist practice






Fo Guang Shan Mottoes



Official Motto


 May the Buddha's Light shine upon the ten directions. May the Dharma stream continuously flow towards the five great continents. 




The Four Verses of Fo Guang Shan and BLIA





May palms in every world be joined in kindness, compassion, joy and generosity.


May all beings find security in friendship, peace and loving care.


May calm and mindful practice give rise of to deep patience and equanimity.


May we give rise to spacious hearts and humble thoughts of gratitude.

Suspiria is a 








1977







 
Italian 
horror film directed by 





Dario Argento




, and co-written by Argento and actress 

Daria Nicolodi
, with whom Argento was romantically involved at the time. Nicolodi claims the plot was inspired by an experience of her grandmother's. The setting was originally to be a children's school but was later changed to a dance school for older teens. Suspiria is often considered Argento's finest film and a classic of the horror genre. 

Entertainment Weekly
 rated it #18 in its top 25 scariest movies of all time, saying it had  the most vicious murder scene ever filmed , and it was rated #24 on the cable channel 
Bravo's list of the  100 Scariest Movie Moments .


Suspiria is the first film in a 
trilogy Argento refers to as  

The Three Mothers
 , about evil forces attempting to break through to the earth and wreak merciless havoc. Argento's next film, 

Inferno
 (



1980


), was the second in the trilogy, and the third is 

The Mother of Tears
.


In a poll of film critics conducted by the 
Village Voice, Suspiria was named the 100th greatest film made during the 20th century1.


The film is also famous among filmmakers as the final feature film to be processed in 
Technicolor before the processing plant was shut down.



Plot

 
The story involves a young 








American







 
ballet student, Suzy Banyon, who arrives in 

Germany
 to attend a prestigious dance academy. On the night of her arrival there is a torrential downpour. When she arrives at the school, she witnesses a  student, a young blonde girl named Pat Hingle, flee the building in a panic. Unable to gain access to the school, Suzy stays in town for the night.


Pat, who fled to a friend's apartment, is horribly murdered by being pulled out of a window onto the roof, stabbed several times, and then hanged by a cord when she falls through the sky light (which results in her friend's death as her friend is pierced by a large sheet of stained glass in the head). Suzy goes to the school the next day and is greeted by Ms. Tanner, an instructor, and Madame Blanc, the vice directress. In the changing room, Suzy meets two other students, Olga and Sara. It's been arranged for Suzy to live with Olga in her apartment. The next day, Suzy becomes dizzy after a maid reflects a piece of silver at her and she passes out due to hemorrhaging during class. The school doctor puts her on a restricted diet consisting of a glass of red wine, and Suzy is moved into the dorms without her consent. She finds out her dorm is next to Sara's, and later hundreds of maggots start to fall from the ceiling. As the girls panic, Ms. Tanner investigates the upper floor and finds crates of spoiled food. Madame Blanc apologizes to the girls, and arranges for all of them to sleep in the practice hall. A wall of sheets separates the girls from the teachers, who are staying with the girls for the night. Suzy asks Sara if the teachers live in the school, but Sara tells her that they leave at 9:30 every night. When the girls sleep, a shadowy figure lays down on the other side of the sheet behind Suzy and Sara. The person has a very distinct, raspy, whistling snore and it frightens Sara, who wakes Suzy up. Sara tells her about a time last year when she had to sleep in a guest bedroom: late that night, she had heard the same snoring in the next room. The next morning, Madame Blanc told Sara that the school's directress stayed in that room. The directress's presence seems odd to Suzy, because they had been told the directress would not return to the school for weeks. 


The next morning, Sara asks Ms. Tanner if the directress showed up last night, but Ms. Tanner tells her that she will be coming back in two weeks. As classes start, Madame Blanc's young nephew, Albert, is attacked by the blind 
pianist's 
guide dog. Enraged, Ms. Tanner interrupts class and tells Daniel, the pianist, never to bring the dog back or she'll have it put to sleep. Daniel yells at her and insists his dog would never harm anyone. Ms. Tanner throws Daniel's cane to the floor and tells him to get out, humiliating him as he fumbles around trying to find his cane.


That night, after Suzy eats her meal Sara comes into her room and they listen while the teachers supposedly leave. However, Suzy notices that the footsteps are going away from the front door. Sara begins to wonder where the go, but Suzy becomes extremely drowsy and can hardly stay awake. Sarah, eager to find out where the teachers go, counts their footsteps as they pass by.


Daniel, who has been out at a bar, leaves with his dog. While in the middle of an empty piazza, his dog begins to bark at something. Daniel tries to calm down the dog, but he just gets more restless as they walk. Daniel begins to become frightened and stops, only to have his dog suddenly attack and kill him.


Suzy is troubled by the sudden number of deaths and approaches Madame Blanc. She tells Blanc that she heard Pat say something the night she died. Due to the rain and thunder that night, Suzy only heard the words  secret  and  irises . Sara gets angry that Suzy told this to Madame Blanc, and tells Suzy that she was Pat's friend. As the two go for a swim in the pool, Sara says Pat was talking about absurd things the day she died, and that Pat had been taking notes for months. However, when Sara is going to show them to Suzy that night, the notes are gone. The only thing she has left is the list of footsteps she made. Sara tries to get Suzy to help her, but once again Suzy cannot stay awake. Sara begins to hear footsteps and flees Suzy's room just before an unseen person enters. Sara escapes to the attic, where she is attacked but hides in a room and latches the door shut. However, her killer tries to use it's knife to unlatch the door. With nowhere else to go, Sarah cowers away from the door when she notices a small window high up. Stacking several boxes on top of each other, she leaps through the window and into a small room filled with razor wire. She tries to escape to an open door a few feet away but keeps getting tangled and cut.  Just as she is near the door, the killer slices her throat.


The next morning, Suzy finds Sara's room empty. Ms. Tanner tells Suzy that Sara left early that morning without telling anyone. Suzy meets with a friend of Sarah's, who turns out to be Sara's psychologist Dr. Mandel (Udo Kier). He tells Suzy that Sara became troubled when a friend put the notion of witches in her head. Sara also found out that the school was founded by Helena Markos, a Greek emigre, who people thought was a witch. However, she died in a fire, and the school was passed down to her favorite pupil who turned it from a school for the occult to a dance academy. Suzy talks to a colleague of Dr. Mandel who specializes in witches. He explains to Suzy that a 
witch is a negative force, that change events only to do harm, and their goal is to gain personal wealth that can only be achieved by injury to others. Suzy asks if there is a guild of witches, and Prof. Millus tells her that she is referring to a 
coven, and can that a coven can only survive with their queen. Otherwise, they are harmless. 


Back at school, Suzy finds out that all the students are gone. She asks a servant, who tells her that all the students went to the theater, and that Ms. Tanner got the tickets. Suzy dumps her food out, and throws the wine down the sink, which looks suspiciously like blood. She begins to hear the teachers footsteps, and counts them. Following her count, Suzy ends up in Madame Blanc's office. With only one door, Suzy tries to find where the teachers are. Glancing into a mirror, she notices irises painted on the wall and figures out that Pat said on the night she was killed ( The secret! I saw behind the door! Three irises! Turn the blue one! ). Suzy turns the blue iris and a hidden door pops open. She sneaks down a hallway and, hiding behind a curtain, overhears the coven stating that Suzy must die. Afraid they might find her, she backs away and stumbles upon Sara's corpse. She flees into a connecting room, only to hear the snoring of the directress. Frightened, she tries to exit but sees one of the coven walk by. Backing up, she knocks over an ornamental peacock statue which wakes up the directress, who reveals herself to be Helena Markos. Suzy picks up one of the metal feathers from the statue and pulls back the curtain of the bed only to find it empty. Confused, Suzy looks around while Markos taunts her. A door slowly opens, and Sara's corpse, back to life and wielding a knife approaches Suzy. Suzy notices a slight outline of Markus, and stabs her through the neck. Sara disappears, and the burnt features of Markos become visible as she dies. With Helena's death, the rest of the coven die as well. Suzy runs away as the school destroys itself. Happy to have escaped, Suzy smiles as she walks away from the school.

Production


The title Suspiria and the general concept of the  

The Three Mothers
  came from 
Suspiria de Profundis, 
Thomas De Quincey's sequel to his 
Confessions of an English Opium Eater. There is a section in Suspiria De Profundis entitled  




Levana



 and Our Ladies of Sorrow .  The piece asserts that just as there are three 




Fates



 and three 




Graces



, there are three Sorrows:  Mater Lachrymarum, Our Lady of Tears,   Mater Suspiriorum, Our Lady of Sighs,  and  Mater Tenebrarum, Our Lady of Darkness. 


Suspiria is noteworthy for several stylistic flourishes that have become Argento trademarks. The film was shot with 
anamorphic lenses.  The 
production design and 
cinematography emphasize vivid 
primary colors, particularly 
red, creating a deliberately unrealistic, nightmarish setting.  This look was emphasized by the use of 
imbibition 
Technicolor prints.  The imbibition process, used for 

The Wizard of Oz
 and 

Gone with the Wind
, is much more vivid in its color rendition than emulsion-based release prints, therefore enhancing the nightmarish quality of the film.


It was rumored that this film contained ghostly images or apparitions in certains scenes within the backgrounds that appeared in glass and lighting that were unexplained. This added to the mystique of the movie.




Soundtrack





Main article: 

Suspiria (soundtrack)


The Italian rock band 

Goblin
 composed most of the film's musical score. Goblin also composed music for several other films by Dario Argento.2 The score for Suspiria is considered a unique masterpiece regarded as a cult hit ahead of its time. It has been reused in multiple Hong Kong films, including 

Yuen Woo-ping
's 
martial arts film 








Dance of the Drunk Mantis







 (1979) and 


Tsui Hark

's horror-comedy We Are Going to Eat You (1980).


Goblin frontman 











Claudio Simonetti










 went onto to form a heavy metal band, Daemonia, and the 2001 Anchor Bay DVD release contains a video of the band playing a reworking of the Suspiria theme song. This DVD edition also contains the entire original soundtrack as a bonus CD, but long out of print in North America.




Response


No aspect of Suspiria was as influential as Argento's flamboyant approach to shooting the many killings occurring in the story. Argento already had a reputation for brutal 
violence in his films, such as his preceding feature, 
Deep Red, and he would later in his career draw much 
criticism for it, including charges of 
misogyny which he staunchly denies. In Suspiria, victims are murdered in extremely elaborate ways; e.g., the first student to die initially has her face shoved through a window, then she is stabbed in the heart repeatedly (in close up), then she is tied up, and her body dropped through the glass 
skylight of a building, only to be stopped in mid-fall by a electric cord around her neck. A large metal support from the skylight claims the second victim, also a young woman.


Suspiria propelled Argento to the front ranks of horror directors throughout the world. Though many of his later films were admired by his fans, Suspiria is generally regarded as his masterpiece.


The film's original theatrical release in the United States was heavily edited, most notably the first (and most infamous) murder sequence. The stabbing and hanging portion of the murder was cut back to the point of being almost purged entirely from the film.




Legacy


In the late 1980s the film was released uncensored on VHS and in its original widescreen format (a rarity at the time for a horror film). After an intense bidding war, the film was released on DVD in the 








United States







 in 
2001 by 


Anchor Bay Entertainment

. This release was criticized on several counts: the DVD was not compatible with the Sony Playstation 2 DVD drive, and many questioned Anchor Bay's decision to release both a single disc version of the film and an expensive three-disc set, which featured an exclusive documentary on the film.


Suspiria seems to have had an effect on the music world. Two bands, a 



Norwegian


 
thrash metal band and a pioneering mid-1990s U.K. 
gothic rock band, have named themselves after the film.  Several albums have also used the title, including 
Suspiria by 


Darkwell

, 

Suspiria
 by 


Miranda Sex Garden

, and Suspiria de Profundis by 


Die Form

 which can also be regarded as inspired by Thomas De Quincey's work of the same title. 





The Smashing Pumpkins

 used the theme from the film as intro music on their 2007 tour. The Houston-based Two Star Symphony Orchestra, on their 2004 CD Danse Macabre: Constant Companion, included a track titled  Goblin Attack  that features a strings rendition of the Suspiria theme. The track's title appears to be a reference to the Italian rock band 

Goblin
.


The movie has recently been sampled in a few 





Underground Rap




 songs, namely 
Cage Kennylz's 
 Weather People  and 
Atmosphere's  Bird Sings Why the Caged I Know .


In the film 

Juno
, the title character mentions Suspiria during a discussion of horror films with character Mark Loring after she finds a SomethingWeird Video copy of 

The Wizard of Gore
.



Remakes


A 
remake was expected for a 



2005


 release according to the 

Internet Movie Database
. This status remained as such into 2006, but the entry was eventually removed. Around the same time, writer Steven Katz stated that the remake  probably will not happen .3 Some fans believe that Argento was responsible, as he was openly against the remake, claiming to have seen a script that was sent out, and saying  it will be shit, but that won't be my fault . But according to the IMDb, the remake has now been announced to be released in 2010.


In June 2006, Japanese studio GONZO reportedly announced the production of an 
anime remake of Suspiria (     ) is in development, but it has not yet announced a release date for TV broadcast. The anime adaptation will be directed by Yoshimasa Hiraike (Solty Rei).[3]


In March 2008, it was announced on the 

MTV
 Movies Blog website that the remake of Suspiria was to be made and released in 2008 with director 



David Gordon Green


 at the helm. The remake is being produced by Italian production company First Sun.


In August, 2008, the 













Bloody Disgusting












 website reported that 


Natalie Portman

's and Annette Savitch's handsome Charlie Films will produce the remake and that Portman will play the lead role.4

Admiral Zinovy Petrovich Rozhestvensky



Zinovy Petrovich Rozhestvensky
1 (

Russian
:                               ) (November 11 [
O.S. October 30] 1848 - 
January 14, 
1909) was an 
admiral of the 
Imperial Russian Navy, who was in command of the Second Pacific Squadron in the 

Battle of Tsushima
, during the 

Russo-Japanese War
. Admiral Rozhesvensky had selected the 











Prince Suvorov










 as his flagship, one of four brand new battleships of the French-designed 



Borodino class


, for the voyage to the Pacific.

Under Admiral Rozhestvensky's command, the Russian navy holds the record of sailing an all steel, coal powered battleship fleet over 18,000 miles one way, to engage an enemy in decisive battle, albeit one with a tragic result for Russia.



Battle of Tsushima


Prior to the war against 
Japan, Rozhestvensky was commander of the 




Baltic Fleet



. Tsar Nicholas II ordered Rozhestvensky to take the Baltic Fleet to 


East Asia

 to protect the 

Russia
n naval base of 
Port Arthur. The Tsar had selected the right man for the job, for it would take an iron-fisted commander to sail an untested fleet of brand new battleships (for some of the new Borodinos, this voyage was their 



shakedown cruise


) and new untrained sailors on the longest coal-powered battleship fleet voyage in history.  Admiral Rozhestvensky, a veteran of the Turkish war, had a fiery temper when dealing with a subordinate, and it was well known to both officers and men to physically stand clear of Mad Dog when a subordinate either disobeyed orders, was incompetent or both.  Rozhestvensky was fully aware of the fact that he had a new untrained navy under his command and that re-coaling stations would not be available during the journey, due to Britain's alliance with Japan; and that both the shakedown testing of the new battleships and the gunnery practice/training would have to occur during the voyage. In addition, re-coaling would have to be done at sea, instead of in port as with most other navies.  As a consequence of these circumstances, the mission-minded commander would sometimes fire service ammunition (live gun fire) across the bows of an errant warship, and in a fiery moment fling his binoculars from the bridge into the sea.  Although Admiral Rozhestvensky was nicknamed Mad Dog only in his absence, that we know of, his iron reputation had preceded him, for when his battleship fleet set sail in 1904, Rozhestvensky's staff ensured that his flagship, Prince Suvorov, had a good supply of binoculars on board.


In the 

Battle of Tsushima
 (27-
28 May 
1905) a superior Japanese fleet under the command of 
T g  Heihachir , utilized his battleship's high speed (due to clean hull bottoms) to maintain their 
Crossing of the  T  formation and destroyed the Russian fleet which had been heavily slowed by barnacles and other sea life brought on by the long voyage.  Unable to maneuver, and with a new mission to break through to 

Vladivostok
, Rozhestvensky charged his battleships ahead into Togo's  T . Wounded in the head by a shell fragment, Rozhestvensky was transferred to a destroyer that was eventually captured. Rozhestvensky was taken prisoner by the 

Imperial Japanese Navy
, but some 5,000 of his men had perished. 
http://www.slashdoc.com/documents/94866. In 1906, his case was taken to court, as was each battleship commander, some facing prison, and some the firing squad for either losing the battle or surrendering on the high seas. The Tsar's court was fully aware that 











Admiral Nebogatov










 had surrendered the Russian fleet, as Rozhestvensky had been wounded and unconscious for most of the battle, and was very reluctant to accept his statements of responsibility.  Nonetheless, Admiral Rozhestvensky was adamant in his defense of his subordinate commanders and maintained total responsibility, where he pleaded guilty to losing the battle.  As was expected (and hoped) by the courts, the Tsar commuted the death-sentenced captains to short prison terms and pardons for the remaining officers.

The Polish-Soviet War (February 1919   March 1921) was an armed conflict of 
Soviet Russia and 





Soviet Ukraine




 against the 

Second Polish Republic
 and the short-lived 

Ukrainian People's Republic
, four states in post-

World War I
 
Europe. The war was the result of conflicting expansionist attempts. Poland, whose statehood had just been re-established  by the 

Treaty of Versailles
 following the 
Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, sought to secure territories which she had lost at the time of partitions; the Soviets' aim was to control those same territories, which had been part of 
Imperial Russia until the turbulent events of the 

Great War
. Both States claimed victory1 in the war: the Poles claimed a successful defense of their state, while the Soviets claimed a repulse of the Polish 

eastward invasion of Ukraine
 and Belarus, which they viewed as a part of 
foreign intervention in the Russian Civil War.


The frontiers between Poland and Soviet Russia had not been defined in the 

Treaty of Versailles
 and post-war events created turmoil: the 
Russian Revolution of 1917; the crumbling of the 
Russian, 

German
 and 

Austrian
 empires; the 

Russian Civil War
; the 

Central Powers
' withdrawal from the 

eastern front
; and the attempts of 

Ukraine
 and 
Belarus to establish their independence. Poland's 
Chief of State, 
Jozef Pi sudski, felt the time expedient to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible, to be followed by the creation of a Polish-led federation (
Mi dzymorze) of several states in the rest of East-Central Europe as a bulwark against the potential re-emergence of both German and Russian 
imperialism. 


Lenin

, meanwhile, saw Poland as the bridge that the 




Red Army



 would have to cross in order to assist 

other communist movements
 and help conduct other European revolutions.


By 1919, the Polish forces had taken control of much of Western Ukraine, with victory in the 

Polish-Ukrainian War
; the 
West Ukrainian People's Republic had tried unsuccessfully to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and the Ukrainians laid claim. At the same time, the Bolsheviks began to gain the upper hand in the Russian Civil War and advance westward towards the disputed territories. By the end of 1919 a clear front had formed. Border skirmishes escalated into open warfare following Pi sudski's 
major incursion further east into Ukraine in April 1920. He was met by a nearly simultaneous and initially very successful Red Army 
counterattack. The Soviet operation threw the Polish forces back westward all the way to the Polish capital, 


Warsaw

. Meanwhile, western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers 
increased the interest of Western powers in the war. In midsummer, the fall of Warsaw seemed certain but in mid-August the tide had turned again as the Polish forces achieved an unexpected and decisive victory at the 

Battle of Warsaw
. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, the Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with a 
ceasefire in October 1920. A formal 
peace treaty, the 









Peace of Riga








, was signed on 18 March 1921, dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. The war largely determined the Soviet-Polish border for the 
period between the World Wars. Much of the territory ceded to Poland in the Treaty of Riga became part of the Soviet Union after 







World War II






, when Poland's eastern borders were redefined by the 






Allies





 in close accordance with the British-drawn 





Curzon Line




 of 1920.



 Names and dates 


The war is referred to by several names.  Polish-Soviet War  may be the most common, but is potentially confusing since  Soviet  is usually thought of as relating to the 



Soviet Union


, which (by contrast with  









Soviet Russia








 ) did not officially come into being until December 1922. Alternative names include  Russo-Polish War2 [or Polish-Russian War] of 1919 20/21  (to distinguish it from earlier Polish-Russian wars) and  Polish-Bolshevik War .3 This second term (or just  Bolshevik War  (

Polish
: Wojna bolszewicka)) is most common in Polish sources. In some Polish sources it is also referred as the  War of 1920  (Polish: Wojna 1920 roku).4


Other points of contention are the starting and ending dates of the war. For example, 
Encyclopedia Britannica begins its article with the date (1919 1920), but then says  Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state Jozef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura (April 21, 1920) and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on May 7. 2 while the Polish 








Internetowa encyklopedia PWN







3 as well as some historians like 













Norman Davies












5 clearly consider 1919 as the starting year of the war. The ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the 
ceasefire was put in force in the autumn of 1920, the 
official treaty ending the war was signed months later, in March 1921.


While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict and only in early 1920 did both sides realize that they were in fact engaged in an all-out war,5 the conflicts that took place in 1919 are closely related to the war that began in earnest a year later.5 In the end, the events of 1920 were only a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude.5

puppet states (


Mitteleuropa

) obsolete,7 and Russia saw its Empire collapse followed by a descent into 
Revolution and 

Civil War
.8 Many small nations of the region saw a chance for real independence and were not prepared to relinquish the opportunity;6 Soviet Russia viewed these territories as rebellious Russian provinces, vital for Russian security,9 but was unable to react swiftly.8


With the success of the 
Greater Poland Uprising in 1918, Poland had re-established its 
statehood for the first time since the 
1795 partition and seen the end of a 123 years of rule by three imperial neighbors: 
Russia, 

Germany
,  and 

Austria-Hungary
. The country, reborn as a 

Second Polish Republic
, proceeded to carve out its borders from the territories of its former partitioners.


Poland was not alone in its newfound opportunities and troubles. Virtually all of the newly independent neighbours began fighting over borders: 

Romania
 fought with 

Hungary
 over 






Transylvania





, 

Yugoslavia
 with 



Italy


 over 

Rijeka
, Poland with 

Czechoslovakia
 over 
Cieszyn Silesia, with Germany over 
Pozna  and 

with Ukrainians
 over 
Eastern Galicia. 

Ukrainians
, Belarusians, 
Lithuanians, 
Estonians and 

Latvians
 fought against each other and against the Russians, who were just as divided.10 Spreading communist influences resulted in communist revolutions in

 commented:  The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begin. 11 All of those engagements   with the sole exception of the Polish-Soviet war   would be shortlived conflicts.

The Polish-Soviet war likely happened more by accident than design, as it is unlikely that anyone in Soviet Russia or in the new Second Republic of Poland would have deliberately planned a major foreign war.512 Poland, its territory a major frontline of the First World War, was unstable politically; it had just won the difficult conflict with the West Ukrainian National Republic and was already engaged in new conflicts with Germany (the 

Silesian Uprisings
) and 
with Czechoslovakia. The attention of revolutionary Russia, meanwhile, was predominantly directed at thwarting counter-revolution and 
intervention by the western powers. While the first clashes between Polish and Soviet forces occurred in February 1919, it would be almost a year before both sides realised that they were engaged in a full war.5





Polish leader 
Jozef Pi sudski






Soviet leader 


Vladimir Lenin





In late 1919 the leader of Russia's new 
communist government, 


Vladimir Lenin

, was inspired by the Red Army's civil-war victories over 
White Russian anti-communist forces and their western allies, and began to see the future of the revolution with greater optimism. The Bolsheviks proclaimed the need for the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, and agitated for a worldwide communist community. Their avowed intent was to link the revolution in Russia with an expected 
revolution in Germany9 and to assist other communist movements in 


Western Europe

; Poland was the geographical bridge that the 




Red Army



 would have to cross in order to do so.139 Lenin s aim was to restore control of the territories ceded by Russia in the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, to infiltrate the borderlands, set up soviet governments there as well as in Poland, and reach Germany where he expected a socialist revolution to break out.9 He believed that Soviet Russia could not survive without the support of a socialist Germany.9 By the end of summer 1919 the Soviets managed to take over most of Ukraine, driving the Ukrainian government from Kiev. In early 1919, they also set up a 
Lithuanian-Belorussian Republic (Litbel). This government was very unpopular due to terror and the collection of food and goods for the army.9 It was not until after the Kiev Offensive had been repelled, however, that some of the Soviet leaders would see the war as the real opportunity to spread the revolution westwards.914 Indeed, the Bolsheviks stated: 






 

But our enemies and yours deceive you when they say that the Russian Soviet Government wishes to plant communism in Polish soil with the bayonets of Russian Red Army men. A communist order is possible only where the vast majority of the working people are penetrated with the idea of creating it by their own strength. Only then can it be solid; for only then can communist policy strike deep roots in a country. The communists of Russia are at present striving only to defend their own soil, their own constructive work; they are not striving, and cannot strive, to plant communism by force in other countries. 15

 





Before the start of the Polish-Soviet War Polish politics were strongly influenced by Chief of State (
naczelnik pa stwa) Jozef Pi sudski.16 Pi sudski wanted 


to break the Russian Empire

17 and create a Polish-led1819202122  
Mi dzymorze Federation  of independent22 states: Poland, 



Lithuania


,  

Ukraine
, and other 


Central

 and 
East European countries emerging out of crumbling empires after the First World War.23  This new union was to become a counterweight to any potential 
imperialist intentions on the part of Russia or Germany. Pi sudski argued that  There can be no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine , but he may have been more interested in Ukraine being split from Russia than in Ukrainians' welfare.2425 He did not hesitate to use military force to 

expand the Polish borders
 to 


Galicia

 and 


Volhynia

, crushing a 
Ukrainian attempt at self-determination in the disputed territories east of the 

Western Bug
 river, which contained a significant Polish minority,9 mainly in cities like 
Lwow (Lviv), but a Ukrainian majority in the countryside. Speaking of Poland's future frontiers, Pi sudski said:  All that we can gain in the west depends on the 




Entente



 on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany,  while in the east  there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far. 26 In the chaos to the east the Polish forces set out to expand there as much as it was feasible. On the other hand, Poland had no intention of joining the western intervention in the Russian Civil War9 or of conquering Russia itself.27

Polish-Soviet War in 1919






==== First Polish-Soviet conflicts ====
The 

first serious armed conflict of the war
 took place around February 14125 - February 16, near the towns of Maniewicze and Biaroza in Belarus.93 By late February 
the Soviet advance had come to a halt. Both Polish and Soviet forces had also been 

engaging the Ukrainian forces
, and active fighting was going on in the territories of the Baltic countries (cf. 
Estonian Liberation War, 

Latvian War of Independence
, 
Freedom wars of Lithuania).





Central and Eastern Europe in December 1919



In early March 1919, Polish units started an offensive, crossing the 

Neman River
, taking 








Pinsk







, and reaching the outskirts of 








Lida







. Both the Soviet and Polish advances began around the same time in April (Polish forces started a major offensive on April 163), resulting in increasing numbers of troops arriving in the area. That month the Bolsheviks captured 
Grodno, but soon were pushed out by a Polish counteroffensive.  Unable to accomplish their objectives and facing strengthening offensives from the White forces, the Red Army withdrew from their positions and reorganized. Soon the Polish-Soviet War would begin in earnest.


Polish forces continued a steady eastern advance.3 They took 








Lida







 on April 173 and 
Nowogrodek on April 18, and recaptured Vilnius on April 19, driving the 
Litbel government from their proclaimed capital.9 On August 8, Polish forces took 

Minsk
3 and on the 28th of that month they deployed 
tanks for the first time. After heavy fighting, the town of 








Babruysk







 near the 

Berezina River
 was captured.3 By October 2, Polish forces reached the 
Daugava river and secured the region from 
Desna to 








Daugavpils







 (Dyneburg).3


Polish success continued until early 1920.3 Sporadic battles erupted between Polish forces and the 




Red Army



, but the latter was preoccupied with the White counter-revolutionary forces and was steadily retreating on the entire western frontline, from 



Latvia


 in the north to Ukraine in the south. In early summer 1919, the White movement had gained the initiative, and its forces under the command of 
Anton Denikin were marching on 

Moscow
. Pi sudski was aware that the Soviets were not friends of independent Poland, and considered war with Soviet Russia inevitable.28 He viewed their advance west as a major issue but also thought that he could get a better deal for Poland from the 

Bolshevik
s than their 
Russian-civil-war contenders,29 as the 
White Russians - representative of the old 

Russian Empire
, 
partitioner of Poland - were willing to accept only limited independence of Poland, likely in the borders similar to that of 

Congress Poland
, and clearly objected to Ukrainian independence, crucial for Pi sudski's Mi dzymorze,30 while the Bolsheviks did proclaim the 
partitions null and void.31 Pi sudski thus speculated that Poland will be better of with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with restored Russian Empire.2932 By his refusal to join the attack on Lenin's struggling government, ignoring the strong pressure from the 




Entente



, Pi sudski had likely saved the Bolshevik government in Summer Fall 1919. He later wrote that in case of a White victory, in the east Poland could only gain the  ethnic border  at best (the 
Curzon line).33 At the same time Lenin offered Poles the territories of 

Minsk
, 

Zhytomyr
, 
Khmelnytskyi, in what was described as mini  

Brest
 ; Polish military leader 

Kazimierz Sosnkowski
 wrote that the territorial proposals of the Bolsheviks were much better than what the Poles had wanted to achieve.33

.






In 1919, several unsuccessful attempts at peace negotiations were made by various Polish and Russian factions.3 In the meantime, Polish-Lithuanian relations worsened as Polish politicians found it hard to accept the Lithuanians' demands for independence and territories, especially on ceding the city of 

Vilnius
, Lithuania's historical capital which had a Polish ethnic majority. Polish negotiators made better progress with the 



Latvia


n Provisional Government, and in late 1919 and early 1920 Polish and Latvian forces were conducting 
joint operations against Soviet Russia.34


The 









Warsaw Treaty








, an agreement with the exiled Ukrainian nationalist leader 
Symon Petlura signed on April 21, 1920, was the main Polish diplomatic success. Petlura, who formally represented the government of the 

Ukrainian People's Republic
 (by then de facto defeated by Bolsheviks), along with some Ukrainian forces, fled to Poland, where he found 
asylum. His control extended only to a sliver of land near the Polish border.35 In such conditions, there was little difficulty convincing Petlura to join an alliance with Poland, despite recent conflict between the two nations that had been settled in favour of Poland.36 By concluding an agreement with Pi sudski, Petlura accepted the Polish territorial gains in Western Ukraine and the future Polish-Ukrainian border along the 

Zbruch River
. In exchange, he was promised independence for Ukraine and Polish military assistance in reinstalling his government in Kiev.9 


For Pi sudski, this alliance gave his campaign for the Mi dzymorze federation the legitimacy of joint international effort, secured part of the Polish eastward border, and laid a foundation for a Polish dominated Ukrainian state between Russia and Poland.36 For Petlura, this was a final chance to preserve the statehood and, at least, the theoretical independence of the Ukrainian heartlands, even while accepting the loss of Western Ukrainian lands to Poland.37 


Yet both of them were opposed at home. Pi sudski faced stiff opposition from Dmowski's 
National Democrats who opposed Ukrainian independence. Petlura, in turn, was criticized by many Ukrainian politicians for entering a pact with the Poles and giving up on Western Ukraine.38143739


The alliance with Petliura did result in 15,000 pro-Polish allied Ukrainian troops at the beginning of the campaign,40 increasing to 35,000 through recruitment and desertion from the Soviet side during the war.40 But in the end, this would prove too few to support Petlura's hopes for independent Ukraine, or Pi sudski's dreams of the Ukrainian ally in the Mi dzymorze federation.

 notes that estimating strength of the opposing sides is very tricky; even generals often had incomplete reports of their own forces.


By early 1920, the Red Army had been very successful against the 
White armies.22 They defeated 
Denikin and signed peace treaties with Latvia and Estonia. The Polish front became their most important war theater and a plurality of Soviet resources and forces were diverted to it. In January 1920, the Red Army began concentrating a 700,000-strong force near the 

Berezina River
 and on Belarus.12 


By the time Poles launched their Kiev offensive, The Red Southwestern Front had about 82,847 soldiers including 28,568 front-line troops. The Poles had some numerical superiority, estimated from 12,000 to 52,000 personnel.41 By the time of the Soviet counter-offensive in mid 1920 the situation had been reversed: Soviets had about 790,000 people - at least 50,000 or more than the Poles; Tukhachevsky estimated that he had 160,000  combat-ready  soldiers; Pi sudski estimated enemy's forces at 200,000 220,000.42


In the course of 1920, almost 800,00043 Red Army personnel were sent to fight in the Polish war, of whom 402,00043 went to the Western front and 355,00043 to the armies of the South-West front in 


Galicia

.

 15 April 1920 - 16 infantry divisions, 3 cavalry brigades

:: 25 April 1920 - 20 infantry divisions, 5 cavalry brigades


Bolshevik commanders in the Red Army's coming offensive would include 


Leon Trotsky

, 

Mikhail Tukhachevsky
 (new commander of the Western Front), 
Aleksandr Yegorov (new commander of the Southwestern Front), the future Soviet ruler 


Joseph Stalin

, and the founder of the 
Cheka (secret police), 
Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky.


The Polish Army was made up of soldiers who had formerly served in the various partitioning empires, supported by some international volunteers, such as the 
Ko ciuszko Squadron.46 




















Boris Savinkov



















 was at the head of an army of 20,000 to 30,000 largely Russian POWs, and was accompanied by 












Dmitry Merezhkovsky











 and 






Zinaida Gippius





. The Polish forces grew from approximately 100,000 in 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920.47 In August, 1920, the Polish army had reached a total strength of 737,767 people; half of that was on the frontline. Given Soviet losses, there was rough numerical parity between the two armies; and by the time of the 
battle of Warsaw Poles might have even had a slight advantage in numbers and logistics.48



Logistics, nonetheless, were very bad for both armies, supported by whatever equipment was left over from World War I or could be captured. The Polish Army, for example, employed guns made in five countries, and 
rifles manufactured in six, each using different ammunition. The Soviets had many military depots at their disposal, left by withdrawing German armies in 1918 19, and modern French armaments captured in great numbers from the White Russians and the Allied expeditionary forces in the Russian Civil War. Still, they  suffered a shortage of arms; both the Red Army and the Polish forces were grossly underequipped by Western standards.49 


The Soviet High Command planned a new offensive in late April/May. Since March 1919, Polish intelligence was aware that the Soviets had prepared for a new offensive and the Polish High Command decided to launch their own offensive before their opponents.912 The plan for 

Operation Kiev
 was to beat the Red Army on Poland's southern flank and install a Polish-friendly Petlura government in Ukraine.9

Until April, the Polish forces had been slowly but steadily advancing eastward. The new 



Latvia


n government requested and obtained Polish help in capturing 








Daugavpils







. The city 

fell after heavy fighting
 in January and was handed over to the Latvians, who viewed the Poles as liberators.34 By March, Polish forces had driven a wedge between Soviet forces to the north (Byelorussia) and south (Ukraine).


On April 24, Poland began its main offensive, 

Operation Kiev
. Its goal was the creation of independent Ukraine9 that would become part of Pi sudski's project of a  
Mi dzymorze  Federation. Poland's forces were assisted by 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers under 
Symon Petlura, representing the 

Ukrainian People's Republic
.40


On April 26, in his  Call to the People of Ukraine , Pi sudski assured that  the Polish army would only stay as long as necessary until a legal Ukrainian government took control over its own territory .50 Despite this, many Ukrainians were just as anti-Polish as anti-Bolshevik,14 and resented the Polish advance.9


The Polish 3rd Army easily won border clashes with the Red Army in Ukraine but the Reds withdrew with minimal losses. The combined Polish-Ukrainian forces entered an abandoned 

Kiev
 on May 7, encountering only token resistance.9


The Polish military thrust was met with 




Red Army



 
counterattacks on 29 May.3 Polish forces in the area, preparing for an offensive towards 

Zhlobin
, managed to push the Soviets back, but were unable to start their own planned offensive. In the north, Polish forces had fared much worse. The Polish 1st Army was defeated and forced to retreat, pursued by the Russian 15th Army which recaptured territories between the 
Western Dvina and 
Berezina rivers. Polish forces attempted to take advantage of the exposed flanks of the attackers but the enveloping forces failed to stop the Soviet advance. At the end of May, the front had stabilised near the small river 
Auta, and Soviet forces began preparing for the next push.


On May 24 1920, the Polish forces in the south were engaged for the first time by 
Semyon Budionny's famous 
1st Cavalry Army (Konarmia). Repeated attacks by Budionny's 
Cossack cavalry broke the Polish-Ukrainian front on June 5.3 The Soviets then deployed mobile cavalry units to disrupt the Polish rearguard, targeting communications and logistics. By June 10, Polish armies were in retreat along the entire front. On June 13, the Polish army, along with the Petlura's Ukrainian troops, abandoned Kiev to the Red Army.

The commander of the Polish 3rd Army in Ukraine, General 
Edward Rydz- mig y, decided to break through the Soviet line toward the northwest. Polish forces in Ukraine managed to withdraw relatively unscathed, but were unable to support the northern front and reinforce the defenses at the 
Auta River for the decisive battle that was soon to take place there.51 


Due to insufficient forces, Poland's 200-mile-long front was manned by a thin line of 120,000 troops backed by some 460 artillery pieces with no strategic reserves. This approach to holding ground harked back to 
Great War practice of  establishing a fortified line of defense . It had shown some merit on a Western Front saturated with troops, machine guns, and artillery. Poland's eastern front, however, was weakly manned, supported with inadequate artillery, and had almost no fortifications.51 


Against the Polish line the Red Army gathered their Northwest Front led by the young General 
Mikhail Tukhachevski. Their numbers exceeded 108,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry, supported by 722 artillery pieces and 2,913 machine guns. The Soviets at some crucial places outnumbered the Poles four-to-one.51 


Tukhachevski launched his offensive on July 4, along the 





Smolensk




-
Brest-Litovsk axis, crossing the 
Auta and 
Berezina rivers.3 The northern 3rd Cavalry Corps, led by 





Gayk Bzhishkyan




 (Gay Dmitrievich Gay, Gaj-Chan), were to envelope Polish forces from the north, moving near the Lithuanian and Prussian border (both of these belonging to nations hostile to Poland). The 4th, 15th, and 3rd Armies were to push decisively west, supported from the south by the 16th Army and Grupa Mozyrska. For three days the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but the Soviet' numerical superiority proved decisive and by July 7 Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front. However, due to the stubborn defense by Polish units, Tukhachevsky's plan to break through the front and push the defenders southwest into the 


Pinsk Marshes

 failed.51 


Polish resistance was offered again on a line of  German trenches , a heavily fortified line of World War I field fortifications that presented a unique opportunity to stem the Red Army offensive. However, the Polish troops were insufficient in number. Soviet forces selected a weakly defended part of the front and broke through. Gej-Chan and Lithuanian forces captured Vilnius on 14 July, forcing the Poles to retreat again. In 


Galicia

 to the south, General 

Semyon Budyonny
's cavalry advanced far into the Polish rear, capturing 

Brodno
 and approaching 
Lwow and 
Zamo  . In early July, it became clear to the Poles that the Soviets' objectives were not limited to pushing their borders westwards. Poland's very independence was at stake.52


Soviet forces moved forward at the remarkable rate of 20 miles (32 km) a day. 
Grodno in Belarus fell on 19 July; Brest-Litovsk fell on 1 August. The Polish attempted to defend the 
Bug River line with 4th Army and Grupa Poleska units, but were able to stop the Red Army advance for only one week. After crossing the 
Narew River on 2 August, the Soviet Northwest Front was only 60 miles (97 km) from Warsaw.3 The 
Brest-Litovsk fortress which was to be the headquarters of the planned Polish counteroffensive fell to the 16th Army in the first attack. Stalin in charge of the Soviet Southwest Front, and was pushing the Polish forces out of Ukraine and then disobeyed orders and closed on Zamo   and 
Lwow, the largest city in southeastern Poland and an important industrial center, defended by the Polish 6th Army. Polish Galicia's Lviv (Lwow) was soon 
besieged. So opening up a hole in the lines of the Red Army as at the same time the way to the Polish capital lay open and five Soviet armies approached Warsaw. Polish politicians tried to secure peace with Moscow on any conditions but the Bolsheviks refused.33


Polish forces in Galicia near Lviv launched a successful counteroffensive to slow the Soviets down which stopped the retreat of Polish forces on the southern front. However, the worsening situation near the Polish capital of Warsaw prevented the Poles from continuing that southern counteroffensive and pushing east. Forces were mustered to take part in the coming battle for Warsaw.53




 Diplomatic Front, Part 2: The political games 


With the tide turning against Poland, Pi sudski's political power weakened, while his opponents', including 











Roman Dmowski










's, rose. Pi sudski did manage to regain his influence, especially over the military, almost at the last possible moment as the Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw. The Polish political scene had begun to unravel in panic, with the government of 








Leopold Skulski







 resigning in early June.


Meanwhile, the Soviet leadership's confidence soared.54 In a telegram, Lenin exclaimed:  We must direct all our attention to preparing and strengthening the Western Front. A new slogan must be announced: 'Prepare for war against Poland'. 55 Soviet communist theorist 
Nikolay Bukharin, writer for the newspaper 

Pravda
, wished for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw  right up to London and Paris .56 General's 
Tukhachevsky order of the day, 2 July, 1920 read:  To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to world-wide conflagration. March on 

Vilno
, 

Minsk
, 


Warsaw

!  and  onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland! 9


By order of the 
Soviet Communist Party, a Polish 
puppet government,57 the 




Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee



 (Polish: Tymczasowy Komitet Rewolucyjny Polski, TKRP), had been formed on 28 July in Bia ystok to organise administration of the Polish territories captured by the Red Army.9 The TKRP had very little support from the ethnic Polish population and recruited its supporters mostly from the ranks of 
Jews14 who were opposed to Polish rule. At the height of the Polish-Soviet conflict, Jews had been subject to anti-semitic violence by Polish forces, who considered Jews to be a potential threat, and who often accused Jews as being the masterminds of Russian Bolshevism.585960 In addition, political intrigues between Soviet commanders grew in the face of their increasingly certain victory. Eventually the lack of cooperation between the top commanders would cost them dearly in the decisive 
battle of Warsaw.

Britain's Prime Minister, 


David Lloyd George

, who wanted to negotiate a favourable trade agreement with the Bolsheviks9 pressed Poland to make peace on Soviet terms and refused any assistance to Poland which would alienate the Whites in the Russian Civil War. In July 1920, Britain announced it would send huge quantities of World War I surplus military supplies to Poland, but a threatened general strike by the 

Trades Union Congress
, who objected to British support of  White Poland , ensured that none of the weapons destined for Poland left British ports. David Lloyd George had never been enthusiastic about supporting the Poles, and had been pressured by his more right-wing Cabinet members such as 
Lord Curzon and 


Winston Churchill

 into offering the supplies. On the 11 July, 1920, the government of Great Britain issued a de facto 
ultimatum to the Soviets.61 The Soviets were ordered to stop hostilities against Poland and the Russian Army (the White Army in Southern Russia lead by Baron Wrangel), and to accept what later was called the  
Curzon line  as a temporary border with Poland, until a permanent border could be established in negotiations.9 In case of Soviet refusal, the British threatened to assist Poland with all the means available, which, in reality, were limited by the internal political situation in the United Kingdom. On the 17  July, the Bolsheviks refused9 and made a counter-offer to negotiate a peace treaty directly with Poland. The British responded by threatening to cut off the on-going trade negotiations if the Soviets conducted further offensives against Poland. These threats were ignored.


The threatened general strike was a convenient excuse for Lloyd George to back out of his commitments. On August 6, 1920, the British 

Labour Party
 published a pamphlet stating that British workers would never take part in the war as Poland's allies, and labour unions blocked supplies to the British expeditionary force assisting Russian Whites in 

Arkhangelsk
. French Socialists, in their newspaper 
L'Humanite, declared:  Not a man, not a 
sou, not a shell for reactionary and capitalist Poland. Long live the Russian Revolution! Long live the Workmen's International!  Poland also suffered setbacks due to sabotage and delays in deliveries of war supplies, when workers in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Germany refused to transit such materials to Poland.9






Lithuania


's stance was mostly anti-Polish; and the country 
had decided to support the Soviet side in July 1920. Lithuania's decision to not join forces with the Poles was dictated by a desire to incorporate the city of 

Vilnius
 and nearby areas into Lithuania and, to a lesser extent, Soviet diplomatic pressure, backed by the threat of the Red Army stationed on Lithuania's borders.51 The conflict culminated in the 
Polish-Lithuanian War, often considered part of the Polish-Soviet War, occurred in August 1920.


Polish allies were few. 

France
, continuing her policy of countering Bolshevism now that the Whites in Russia proper had been almost completely defeated, sent a 400-strong 
advisory group to Poland's aid in 1919. It consisted mostly of French officers, although it also included 
a few British advisers led by Lieutenant General Sir 
Adrian Carton De Wiart. The French officers included a future President of France, 


Charles de Gaulle

; during the war he won Poland's highest military decoration, the 

Virtuti Militari
. In addition to the Allied advisors, France also facilitated the transit to Poland from France of the  




Blue Army



  in 1919: troops mostly of Polish origin, plus some international volunteers, formerly under French command in World War I. The army was commanded by the Polish general, 
Jozef Haller. 

Hungary
 offered to send a 30,000 cavalry corps to Poland's aid, but the Czechoslovakian government refused to allow them through; some trains with weapon supplies from Hungary did, however, arrive in Poland.


In mid-1920, the Allied Mission was expanded by some advisers (becoming the 
Interallied Mission to Poland). They included: French diplomat, 






Jean Jules Jusserand





; 

Maxime Weygand
, chief of staff to Marshal 

Ferdinand Foch
, Supreme Commander of the victorious Entente; and British diplomat, Lord 
Edgar Vincent D'Abernon. The newest members of the mission achieved little; indeed, the crucial Battle of Warsaw was fought and won by the Poles before the mission could return and make its report. Nonetheless for many years, a 
myth persisted that it was the timely arrival of Allied forces that had saved Poland, a myth in which Weygand occupied the central role.962 Nonetheless Polish-French cooperation would continue. Eventually, on the 21 February, 1921, France and Poland entered into 













a formal military alliance












,63 which became an important factor during the subsequent Soviet-Polish negotiations.

 as well as stopping the 

assault at Radzymin
.3


The Soviet 
commander-in-chief, 

Mikhail Tukhachevsky
, felt certain that all was going according to his plan. However, Polish 
military intelligence had decrypted the Red Army's radio messages,646566 and Tukhachevsky was actually falling into a trap set by Pi sudski and his Chief of Staff, 
Tadeusz Rozwadowski.9 The Soviet advance across the Vistula River in the north was moving into an operational vacuum, as there were no sizable Polish forces in the area. On the other hand, south of Warsaw, where the fate of the war was about to be decided, Tukhachevski had left only token forces to guard the vital link between the Soviet northwest and southwest fronts. Another factor that influenced the outcome of the war was the effective neutralization of Budionny's 1st Cavalry Army, much feared by Pi sudski and other Polish commanders, in the 
battles around Lwow. The Soviet High Command, at Tukhachevski's insistence, had ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march north toward Warsaw and 

Lublin
, but Budionny disobeyed the order due to a grudge between Tukhachevski and 
Yegorov, commander of the southwest front. Additionally, the political games of 


Joseph Stalin

, chief political 
commissar of the Southwest Front, decisively influenced the disobedience of Yegorov and Budionny.67 Stalin, seeking a personal triumph, was focused on capturing 
Lwow far to the southeast of Warsaw which was besieged by Bolshevik forces but still resisted their assaults.51


The Polish 5th Army under General 
W adys aw Sikorski counterattacked on August 14 from the area of the 
Modlin fortress, crossing the 



Wkra


 River. It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and 
Modlin had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By August 16, the Polish counteroffensive had been fully joined by Marshal Pi sudski's  Reserve Army.  Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, advancing from the south, found a huge gap between the Soviet fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet  Mozyr Group  that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevski's forces, the majority of which were encircled by August 18. Only that same day did Tukhachevski, at his 

Minsk
 headquarters 300 miles (480 km) east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all.51


The Soviet armies in the center of the front fell into chaos. Tukhachevski ordered a general retreat toward the 
Bug River, but by then he had lost contact with most of his forces near Warsaw, and all the Bolshevik plans had been thrown into disarray by communication failures.51


The Bolshevik armies retreated in a disorganised fashion; entire divisions panicking and disintegrating. The Red Army's defeat was so great and unexpected that, at the instigation of Pi sudski's detractors, the 

Battle of Warsaw
 is often referred to in Poland as the  
Miracle at the Vistula . Previously unknown documents from Polish Central Military Archive found in 2004 proved that successful breaking of Red Army radio communications 
ciphers by Polish cryptographers played great role in the victory.68





The advance of 

Budyonny's
 
1st Cavalry Army toward 


Lwow

 was halted, first at the 
battle of Brody (July 29 August 2),3 and then on August 17 at the 
Battle of Zadworze,3 where a small Polish force sacrificed itself to prevent Soviet cavalry from seizing Lwow and stopping vital Polish reinforcements from moving toward Warsaw. Moving through weakly defended areas, Budyonny's cavalry reached the city of 
Zamo   on 29 August and attempted to take it in the 
battle of Zamo  ;3 however, he soon faced an increasing number of Polish units diverted from the successful Warsaw counteroffensive. On August 31, Budyonny's cavalry finally broke off its siege of Lwow and attempted to come to the aid of Soviet forces retreating from Warsaw. The Soviet forces were intercepted and defeated by 
Polish cavalry at the 
Battle of Komarow near Zamo  , the greatest cavalry battle since 1813 and one of the last cavalry battles in history. Although Budionny's Army managed to avoid encirclement, it suffered heavy losses and its morale plummeted.3 The remains of Budionny's 1st Cavalry Army retreated towards 








Volodymyr-Volynskyi







 on 6 September3 and was defeated shortly thereafter at the 
Battle of Hrubieszow.


Tukhachevski managed to reorganize the eastward-retreating forces and in September established a new defensive line running from the Polish-Lithuanian border to the north to the area of 
Polesie, with the central point in the city of 
Grodno in Belarus. In order to break this line, the Polish Army had to fight the 

Battle of the Niemen River
. Polish forces crossed the Niemen River and outflanked the Bolshevik forces, which were forced to retreat again.3 Polish forces continued to advance east on all fronts,3 repeating their successes from the previous year. After the early October 
Battle of the Szczara River, the Polish Army had reached the 

Ternopil
-

-

Minsk
-

In the south, Petliura's Ukrainian forces defeated the Bolshevik 14th Army and on September 18th took control of the left bank of the 
Zbruch river. During the next month they moved east to the line Yaruha on the 

Dniester

 Conclusion 


Soon after the Battle of Warsaw the Bolsheviks sued for peace. The Poles, exhausted, constantly pressured by the Western governments and the 

League of Nations
, and with its army controlling the majority of the disputed territories, were willing to negotiate. The Soviets made two offers: one on 21 September and the other on 28 September. The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on 2 October. On the 5th, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer which Poland accepted. The 
armistice between Poland on one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on 12 October and went into effect on 18 October.3 Long negotiations of the peace treaty ensued.


Meanwhile, Petliura's Ukrainian forces, which now numbered 23,000 soldiers and which controlled territories immediately to the east of Poland, planned an offensive in Ukraine for November 11 but were attacked by the Bolsheviks on November 10. By November 21, after several battles, they were driven into Polish-controlled territory.69






 Aftermath 





Main article: 
Aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War




Further information: 
Controversies of the Polish-Soviet War

According to the British historian 
A.J.P. Taylor, the Polish-Soviet War  largely determined the course of European history for the next twenty years or more. [ ] Unavowedly and almost unconsciously, Soviet leaders abandoned the cause of international revolution.  It would be twenty years before the Bolsheviks would send their armies abroad to 'make revolution'.1470 According to American sociologist 
Alexander Gella  the Polish victory had gained twenty years of independence not only for Poland, but at least for an entire central part of Europe.71


After the peace negotiations Poland did not maintain all the territories it had controlled at the end of hostilities. Due to their losses in and after the Battle of Warsaw, the Soviets offered the Polish peace delegation substantial territorial concessions in the contested borderland areas, closely resembling the border between the 

Russian Empire
 and the 
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth before the first 
partition of 1772.72 Polish resources were exhausted, however, and Polish public opinion was opposed to a prolongation of the war.9 The Polish government was also pressured by the 

League of Nations
, and the negotiations were controlled by Dmowski's 
National Democrats: Pi sudski might have controlled the military, but parliament (
Sejm) was controlled by Dmowski, and the peace negotiations were of a political nature. National Democrats, like 
Stanis aw Grabski,72 who earlier had resigned his post to protest the Polish Ukrainian alliance39 and now wielded much influence over the Polish negotiators, cared little for Pi sudski's 
Mi dzymorze; this post-war situation proved a death blow to Pi sudski's dream of reviving the multicultural 
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the form of the Mi dzymorze.9 


More than one million Poles

 were abandoned in the SU, systematically persecuted by Soviet authorities because of political, economical and religious reasons (see the 
Polish operation of the NKVD).


The National Democrats in charge of the state24 also had few concerns about the fate of Ukrainians, and cared little that their political opponent, Pi sudski, felt honor-bound by his treaty obligations;73 his opponents did not hesitate to scrap the treaty. National Democrats wanted only the territory that they viewed as 'ethnically or historically Polish' or possible to 
polonize.74 Despite the Red Army's crushing defeat at Warsaw and the willingness of Soviet chief negotiator 
Adolf Joffe to concede almost all disputed territory,72 National Democrats ideology allowed the Soviets to regain certain territories.72 The 









Peace of Riga








 was signed on March 18, 1921,3 splitting the disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between Poland and Russia.75 The treaty, which Pi sudski called an act of cowardice,73 and for which he apologized to the Ukrainians,9 actually violated the terms of Poland's military alliance with Ukraine, which had explicitly prohibited a separate peace;36 Ukrainian allies of Poland suddenly found themselves 
interned by the Polish authorities.75 The internment worsened relations between Poland and its Ukrainian minority: those who supported Petliura felt that Ukraine had been betrayed by its Polish ally, a feeling that grew stronger due to the assimilationist policies of nationalist inter-war Poland towards its minorities. To a large degree, this inspired the growing tensions and 
eventual violence against Poles in the 1930s and 1940s.76


The war and its aftermath also resulted in 
other controversies, such as 
situation of prisoners of war of 
both sides,7778 treatment of the civilian population798081 and behaviour of some commanders like 
Stanis aw Bu ak-Ba achowicz82 or 
Vadim Yakovlev.83 The 
Polish military successes in the autumn of 1920 allowed Poland to capture the 
Vilnius region(Vilnius) region, where a Polish-dominated Governance Committee of 
Central Lithuania (Komisja Rz dz ca Litwy  rodkowej) was formed. A 
plebiscite was conducted, and the Vilnius 
Sejm voted on February 20, 1922, for incorporation into Poland. This worsened Polish-Lithuanian relations for decades to come.8 However the loss of Vilnius might have safeguarded the very existence of the Lithuanian state in the interwar period. Despite an alliance with Soviets (
Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920) and the war with Poland, Lithuania was very close to being invaded by the Soviets in summer 1920 and having been forcibly converted into a socialist republic. It was only the Polish victory against the Soviets in the 

Polish-Soviet War
 (and the fact that the Poles did not object to some form of Lithuanian independence) that derailed the Soviet plans and gave Lithuania an experience of interwar independence.84 Another controversy concerned the 
pogroms of 
Jews, which has caused the United States to send a commission lead by 





















Henry Morgenthau, Sr.




















 to investigage the matter.85

Military strategy in the Polish-Soviet War influenced 


Charles de Gaulle

, then an instructor with the Polish Army who fought in several of the battles. He and 
W adys aw Sikorski were the only military officers who, based on their experiences of this war, correctly predicted how the next one would be fought. Although they failed in the 
interbellum to convince their respective militaries to heed those lessons, early in 







World War II






 they rose to command of their armed forces in exile. The Polish-Soviet War also influenced Polish military doctrine, which for the next 20 years would place emphasis on the mobility of elite cavalry units.9


In 1943, during the course of 







World War II






, the subject of Poland's eastern borders was re-opened, and they were discussed at the 
Teheran Conference. 


Winston Churchill

 argued in favor of the 1920 





Curzon Line




 rather than the Treaty of Riga's borders, and an agreement among the Allies to that effect was reached at the 





Yalta Conference




 in 1945.86 The Western Allies, despite having alliance treaties with Poland and despite 
Polish contribution also ceded Poland to the Soviet 
sphere of influence. This is known as the 
Western Betrayal.


Until 1989, while communists held power in a 

People's Republic of Poland
, the Polish-Soviet War was omitted or minimized in Polish and other 
Soviet bloc countries' history books, or was presented as foreign intervention during the 

Russian Civil War
 to fit in with communist ideology.87

Notes






The question of victory is not universally agreed on. Russian and Polish historians tend to assign victory to their respective countries. Outside assessments vary, mostly between calling the result a Polish victory and inconclusive. Lenin in his secret report to the 9th Conference of the Bolshevik Party on September 20, 1920, called the outcome of the war  In a word, a gigantic, unheard-of defeat  (see The Unknown Lenin, ed.

)

 Although the Polish premier and many of his associates sincerely wanted peace, other important Polish leaders did not. Josef Pilsudski, chief of state and creator of Polish army, was foremost among the latter. Pilsudski hoped to build not merely a Polish nation state but a greater federation of peoples under the aegis of Poland which would replace Russia as the great power of Eastern Europe. Lithuania, Belorussia and Ukraine were all to be included. His plan called for a truncated and vastly reduced Russia, a plan which excluded negotiations prior to military victory. Richard K Debo,  Survival and Consolidation: The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia, 1918 192, 
Google Print, p. 59, McGill-Queen's Press, 1992, ISBN 0-7735-0828-7.

 [Pilsudski] hoped to incorporate most of the territories of the defunct 

Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth into the future Polish state by structuring it as the Polish-led, multinational federation. 
Aviel Roshwald,  
Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914 1923 , p. 37, Routledge (UK), 2001, ISBN 0-415-17893-2

 Pilsudski dreamed of drawing all the nations situated between Germany and Russia into an enormous federation in which Poland, by virtue of its size, would be the leader, while Dmowski wanted to see a unitary Polish state, in which other Slav peoples would become assimilated. Andrzej Paczkowski, 
The Spring Will Be Ours: Poland and the Poles from Occupation to Freedom, p. 10, Penn State Press, 2003, ISBN 0-271-02308-2

 Pilsudski's program for a federation of independent states centered on Poland; in opposing the imperial power of both Russia and Germany it was in many ways a throwback to the romantic Mazzinian nationalism of Young Poland in the early nineteenth century. But his slow consolidation of dictatorial power betrayed the democratic substance of those earlier visions of national revolution as the path to human liberation James H. Billington, 
Fire in the Minds of Men'', p. 432, Transaction Publishers, ISBN 0-7658-0471-9



Zbigniew Brzezinski
 in his introduction to Wac aw J drzejewicz s  Pilsudski A Life For Poland  wrote: Pilsudski s vision of Poland, paradoxically, was never attained. He contributed immensely to the creation of a modern Polish state, to the preservation of Poland from the Soviet invasion, yet he failed to create the kind of multinational commonwealth, based on principles of social justice and ethnic tolerance, to which he aspired in his youth. One may wonder how relevant was his image of such a Poland in the age of nationalism.... Quoted from

 In September 1919 the armies of the Ukrainian Directory in Podolia found themselves in the  death triangle . They were squeezed between the Red Russians of Lenin and Trotsky in the north-east, White Russians of Denikin in south-east and the Poles in the West. Death were looking into their eyes. And not only to the people but to the nascent Ukrainian state. Therefore, the chief ataman Petlura had no choice but to accept the union offered by Pi sudski, or, as an alternative, to capitulate to the Bolsheviks, as Volodymyr Vinnychenko or Mykhailo Hrushevsky did at the time or in a year or two. The decision was very hurtful. The Polish Szlachta was a historic enemy of the Ukrainian people. A fresh wound was bleeding, the West Ukrainian People's Republic, as the Pilsudchiks were suppressing the East Galicians at that very moment. However, Petlura agreed to peace and the union, accepting the Ukrainian-Polish border, the future Soviet-Polish one. It's also noteworthy that Pi sudski also obtained less territories than offered to him by Lenin, and, in addition, the war with immense Russia. The Dnieper Ukrainians then were abandoning their brothers, the Galicia Ukrainians, to their fate. However, Petlura wanted to use his last chance to preserve the statehood - in the union with the Poles. Attempted, however, without luck. Oleksa Pidlutskyi, ibid''

At a closed meeting of the 9th Conference of the Russian Communist Party on September 22, 1920, Lenin said:  We confronted the question: whether [...] to take advantage of the enthusiasm in our army and the advantage which we enjoyed to sovietize Poland... the defensive war against imperialism was over, we won it... We could and should take advantage of the military situation to begin an offensive war... we should poke about with bayonets to see whether the socialist revolution of the proletariat had not ripened in Poland... that somewhere near Warsaw lies not [only] the center of the Polish bourgeois government and the republic of capital, but the center of the whole contemporary system of international imperialism, and that circumstances enabled us to shake that system, and to conduct politics not in Poland but in Germany and England. In this manner, in Germany and England we created a completely new zone of proletarian revolution against global imperialism... By destroying the Polish army we are destroying the Versailles Treaty on which nowadays the entire system of international relations is based.....Had Poland become Soviet....the Versailles Treaty ...and with it the whole international system arising from the victories over Germany, would have been destroyed.

James Bryant Conant




James Bryant Conant (
March 26, 
1893   
February 11, 
1978) was a 
chemist, educational administrator, and government official.  He was born in 















Dorchester, Massachusetts














 in 1893 and graduated from the 

Roxbury Latin School
 in 













West Roxbury












 in 1910. He went on to study 
chemistry at 


Harvard

 (
B.A., 1914; 


Ph.D.

, 1917).  At Harvard he studied under 










Charles Loring Jackson









, and became acquainted with 

Roger Adams
, 












Farrington Daniels











, 





Frank C. Whitmore




 and 

James B. Sumner
. As a Harvard 
professor, he worked on both 
physical and 
organic chemistry. The 

American Chemical Society
 honored him with its highest prize, the 



Priestley Medal


, in 1944.  


In 1933, Conant accepted an appointment as the 
President of Harvard University, a post he held until 1953.  Between 1941 and 1946, he also served as chairman of the 
National Defense Research Committee; from that position he played a key role, along with his close friend 


Vannevar Bush

, in ramping up the 











Manhattan Project










 which developed the first 
nuclear weapons. After 







World War II






 he was an advisor to both the 

National Science Foundation
 and the 


Atomic Energy Commission

.  He served as 
U.S. High Commissioner and 
United States Ambassador to Germany from 1953 to 1957. 


As the university's president, Conant was instrumental in transforming 
Harvard, until then still somewhat parochial and New England 'white bread,' into an increasingly diverse and world-class research university. He introduced aptitude tests into the undergraduate admissions system so that students would be chosen for their intellectual promise and merit, rather than their social connections. Many American colleges followed Conant's lead, and this campaign led eventually to the adoption of the 







SAT






. Conant also did much to move general undergraduate curriculum away from its traditional emphasis on the 
classics, and towards a more scientific and modern subject matter.  He was active throughout his career on issues of education and scientific policy.  For this work, he was awarded the prestigious 



Sylvanus Thayer Award


 by the 
United States Military Academy at West Point.


Conant also actively promoted the discipline of 
history of science, instituting the 
Harvard Case Histories in Experimental Science and including history of science in the General Education curriculum. For Conant, an approach to science history that emphasized the internal and intellectual dimensions of scientific development   as opposed to the so-called external factors of sociology, economics and politics   reinforced the American 
Cold War ideology and would help Americans understand the importance of science since the 







Second World War






. During that time, American science (and especially the field of physics that Conant viewed as exemplary) was rapidly becoming dominated by 
military funding, and Conant sought to defuse concerns about the possible corruption of science.  Conant was instrumental in the early career of 
Thomas Kuhn, whose 






The Structure of Scientific Revolutions





 has been extremely influential for the various fields of 
science studies. 


Conant died in 

Hanover, New Hampshire
 in 1978. James B. Conant Middle School is a former school named after the man in 








Neenah, Wisconsin







, though it has since become the  Conant  building of 

Neenah High School
, in addition to the 


Neil Armstrong

 building and a large building connecting the two known simply as  The Link.  

James B. Conant High School
 in 

Hoffman Estates, Illinois
 was named after Conant, as was James B. Conant Elementary School in 

Bloomfield Hills, Michigan
.

CQB team moving through structure during CQB training.





Close Quarters Battle (CQB) or close quarters combat (CQC) is a type of fighting in which small units engage the enemy with personal weapons at very short range, potentially to the point of 
hand-to-hand combat. In the typical CQB scenario, the attackers try a very fast, violent takeover of a vehicle or structure controlled by the defenders, who usually have no easy way to withdraw. Because enemies, hostages/civilians, and fellow operators can be closely intermingled, CQB demands a rapid assault and a precise application of lethal force. The operators need great proficiency with their weapons, but also the ability to make split-second decisions in order to avoid or limit friendly casualties. CQB is defined as a short-duration, high-intensity conflict, characterized by sudden violence at close range.


Criminals sometimes use CQB techniques, such as in an 
armed robbery or 
jailbreak, but most of the terminology comes from training used to prepare soldiers, police, and other authorities. Therefore, much CQB material is written from the perspective of the authorities who must break into the stronghold where the opposing force (opfor) have barricaded themselves.


Although there is considerable overlap, CQB is not synonymous with 
urban warfare, now sometimes known by the military acronyms MOUT (military operations on urban terrain), FIBUA (fighting in built-up areas) or OBUA (Operations in Built Up Areas) in the West. Urban warfare is a much larger field, including logistics and the role of crew-served weapons like heavy 
machine guns, 
mortars, and mounted 
grenade launchers, as well as artillery, armor, and air support. In CQB, the emphasis is on small infantry units using light, compact weapons that one man can carry and use easily in tight spaces, such as 
submachine guns, 
shotguns, 
pistols, and 
knives.



Principles of assault



Detailed planning


Ideally, the leader of the assault team gathers all available 
intelligence about the crisis scene, targets, and innocents. He diagrams and discusses the proposed plan, outlining each team s actions and responsibilities, location, fields of fire, and special tasks (even to the point of a wall-by-wall and door-by-door layout of the objective, where available). Since the assault team usually already has specialized training, the operation is based on well-understood, pre-established standing operating procedure. When considerable preparation time is available, the team sometimes conducts step-by-step walk-through exercises on a mock-up that duplicates the target environment. Some units maintain permanent  shoot houses  or even airliner/ship mock-ups for practicing marksmanship and tactics more realistically.


In a prolonged standoff, the attackers can sometimes bring in specialized equipment for probing the inside of a well-defended area. Sensitive thermal cameras can help locate the occupants, and surveillance personnel can run microphones and 
fiber-optic cameras through walls, ceilings, and floors. The  throw phones  used to establish contact between authorities and suspects often contain hidden cameras or infrared illuminators for added intelligence-gathering. If hostages escape or can communicate/signal the attackers, they can provide more information from inside.


However, the time and resources to carry out such luxurious preparations are not always there. Not every attacker can field an overwhelming force of specially trained and equipped men with reinforcements standing by. Information about the inside of an enemy-held building or vehicle may not be accessible beyond studying it through binoculars or a rifle scope. While some attackers can go to the lengths of wearing the enemy down by siege or even 










tunneling under them









, others must get the current job done immediately with the force available in order to move on to the next.




Surprise





Military team conducting a stealthy approach to the target CQB training.





The objective is to complete all offensive action before the party being engaged is able to react. To gain this element of surprise, the entry teams use stealth movement and noise/light discipline to get as close to the targets as possible, hopefully putting themselves in a position to engage an enemy from the moment he becomes aware of them. Some teams use subsonic 
sniper rifles for their initial shots on sentries or dogs.


An assault should come at a time when least expected, taking into consideration fatigue, normal sleep periods, and other factors that detract from the target's alertness. Diversions are an essential element in achieving surprise. Staged emergencies, such as a mock auto accident, fire, or explosion near the crisis site, can divert the target's attention away from the assaulting elements. Explosive breaching and diversionary devices, such as 
flash bang, smoke, or gas 
grenades can be employed to distract and disorient the targets. Negotiators can try to manipulate the defenders into a more vulnerable position or convince them that their position will not be stormed.




Methods of entry





Entry team approaching target breach point during CQB training.





When law enforcement clears a building, they usually work in a slow and deliberate manner using ballistic shields and mirrors for searching. This affords the highest degree of safety and security for the police, as well as any uninvolved bystanders inside the search area, who can be identified and safely removed without subjecting them to the shock and danger of a sudden assault. When suspects are encountered, the police can confront them with an alert, armed force and try to take control without shooting. If the searchers meet heavy resistance, they can usually pull back without harm and prepare for a dynamic entry.


However, against determined, well-armed opponents who fight in concert to defend an area and keep it under their control, slow stop-and-go movement can cause the deaths of many attackers and hostages. That leads to dynamic entry, used in military operations or hostage rescues. It is the popular image of CQB: a flood of gunmen who burst in without warning and attempt to seize the area. Dynamic entry tactics must be rapid and aggressive, ideally a continuous flow using overwhelming force that does not stop until the threat is eliminated.


In the vast majority of hostage rescue and other dynamic CQB operations, it is desirable to use multiple simultaneous attacks from different entry points to overload the target's ability to react effectively. The more entry points the attackers can choose from, the better their chances. The teams actually entering the objective usually have to synchronize with snipers, negotiators, power technicians, perimeter guards, and others who assist from the outside. Medical personnel, investigators, and bomb experts may be prepped to enter the scene as soon as the initial attackers get control.


It is important that a central commander coordinate all armed elements, not only to better complete a sweep of the target area, but especially to guard against 
friendly fire. Most 
assault rifle bullets can go straight through an enemy and still exit with enough force to kill again, so letting enemies get between two attackers (or attacker and hostage) can easily lead to fratricide. Pistol rounds and shotgun pellets carry less risk of overpenetration through a human body, but on a miss, they can still blast through several sheets of drywall and kill unseen people on the other side. When large areas must be searched, leaders will assign boundaries between elements and track them by radio to ensure they do not interfere with each other. The goal is to establish overlapping fields of fire, so that multiple shooters can attack at once from different directions without danger of hitting one another.


Also, it is possible that a point of entry can be created by a precision explosive device to catch the adversary by surprise. An explosive designed for this job is called the Gate Crasher developed by 
Alford Technologies




Speed


Once the assault begins, the team must gain control before the target understands what is happening and can prepare an effective defense or mount a counterattack. The defenders sometimes have a contingency plan that could cause the attack to fail instantly, such as killing hostages, detonating bombs, or destroying evidence. If they can execute an organized plan, such as falling back into a prepared stronghold, or breaking through the perimeter, the possibility of friendly casualties increases. Speed is achieved through well-designed tactics, such as gaining proximity with an undetected approach, the use of multiple entry points, and explosive breaching. Note that the need for speed does not necessarily translate to individual operators choosing to run in these situations.




Violence of action


For the dynamic entry team, gaining and maintaining physical and psychological momentum is essential. They smash down doors, blast holes in walls, come through windows, and drop from helicopters. Vehicle-mounted rams and platforms are used to create unexpected entry points. The sensory onslaught from tear gas, explosive breaching, 
flashbangs, and gunfire is complemented by the intimidating and aggressive actions of the assault team. Hostiles do sometimes hide among the hostages, so once the shooting has stopped, operators must maintain dominance over anyone still alive.


The defenders try to stop enemies close to the entry points. The  
fatal funnel  is the dangerous area where the assaulter is silhouetted against his own entry point from the perspective of defenders inside the room. Once operators begin to enter, the defenders try to keep them from escaping the fatal funnel. The attackers are also vulnerable from the corners closest to the entry point, the first place from which they can be hit from behind as they enter the room. If the first attackers cannot clear the corners and get out of the fatal funnel, allowing those behind to move in and help, the attack can bog down.


Military uses of close quarters battle vary by unit type, branch and mission. 
Military operations other than war (MOOTW) may involve 
peacekeeping or 
riot control. Specialized forces such as the U.S. Marine Corps specialized units like: RTT, FAST, SRT and U.S. Marine Corps special operations teams such as Recon and MSOB platoons, 










U.S. Coast Guard









 or U.S. Navy VBSS (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) teams may adapt CQB tactics to their specific needs, e.g. for the boarding compliant and non-compliant vessels at sea. Hostage rescue or extraction by 
commando troops such as the British or Australian 

Special Air Service
, 

Delta Force
, 

U.S. Navy SEALs
 or 

Sayeret Matkal
 may involve even more esoteric adaptations or variations, depending on specialized environments, weapons technology, political considerations or a mixture of friendly, unfriendly or civilian personnel.


Armies that often engage in 
urban warfare operation may train most of their infantry in basic CQB doctrine as it relates to common tasks such as building entry,  clearing a room  and 
concussion and other grenades.





Police


Domestically, police crisis response teams (CRTs) are the primary groups to engage in CQB. Situations involving the potential for CQB generally involve extraordinary threats outside of conventional police capabilities, and thus CRTs are specifically organized, equipped, and trained to respond to these situations. These situations often require the special tactics and techniques involving building entry and room clearing procedures that are the hallmarks of CQB.


Police CQB doctrine is also specialized by unit type and mission. 
Riot control, 
corrections, the 
FBI Hostage Rescue Team and 
SWAT teams, for example, each have different goals, but may make use of similar tactics and technology such as 
non-lethal force. A 
prison, for example, may have a squad which specializes in high-risk cell extractions, and 
psychiatric hospitals or wards often have similar specialized teams. Among the  less-than-lethal  tools and tactics central to police CQB are 
electroshock guns, 
pepper spray, 
riot shields and 
riot guns to fire 
tear gas, 
rubber bullets, 
plastic bullets or 
beanbag rounds. However, so-called  less-than-lethal  weapons can still inflict injuries that may result in death.




Private industry


Private corporations engaged in security or military operations overseas maintain internal CQB teams. For example, these teams might be responsible for responding to an incident at a facility operated by a government agency who has engaged the 






contractor





's services. That team would then act as the Crisis Response Team (CRT) and  clear  the facility of threats or hostiles. In another example, 
Military corporations or 
Private military contractor might be employed to provide protection for high-ranking diplomats or military officers in war zones.

History



The name of the Pateros most likely came from its duck-raising industry. The 

Tagalog
 word (of 

Spanish
 origin) for duck is pato and pateros means duck-raisers. An equally viable theory, though less known is that the name also came from the town's small shoe-making industry. The Tagalog word for shoe is sapatos and shoe-makers are called sapateros.


Before 1770, Pateros was only a barrio of 

Pasig
 until the Spanish Governor-General in the Philippines issued a decree making Pateros an independent municipality.


On 
March 29, 
1900, Pateros became one of the towns in the newly created  province of 

Rizal
, by virtue of General Order No. 40 Act No 137 of Philippine Commission promulgated on June 11, 1901. Then on 
October 12, 
1903, Act No. 942 combined Pateros, 

Taguig
 and 

Muntinlupa
 into a single municipality under Pateros. The municipality was renamed into Taguig on 
March 22, 
1905, through Act 1308. Executive Order No. 20 dated 
February 29, 
1908 separated Pateros from Taguig and Pateros then gained its independent status as municipality on 
January 1, 
1909 by Executive Order No. 36. On 
November 7, 
1975, Pateros became a part of the new 

Metropolitan Manila Area
 through Presidential Decree No. 824.

Sandy Hill (

French
: Cote-de-Sable) is a neighbourhood in 

Ottawa
, 

Ontario
 located just east of downtown.  The neighbourhood is bordered on the west by the 

Rideau Canal
 and on the east by the 



Rideau River


.  To the north it stretches to 



Rideau Street


 and the 







Byward Market






 area while to the south it is bordered by the 





Queensway




 highway and 



Nicholas Street


. The area is named for its hilliness, caused by the river, and its sandy soil, which makes it difficult to erect large buildings.1  The population as of 
2006 was roughly 12,078 residents.



History





Map of Sandy Hill (from 













OpenStreetMap












)



Sandy Hill was, during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, Ottawa's wealthiest neighbourhood.  Originally the estate of 
Louis-Theodore Besserer,
who donated part of this land to 

University of Ottawa
, it was subdivided and
became home to most of Ottawa's 
lumber barons.  When Ottawa became the country's capital, it became home to senior public servants and to the 

Prime Minister
 who lived at Stadacona Hall and later at what is now known as 









Laurier House








.


The construction of bridges over the canal and the introduction of 
automobiles and 
streetcars made the area much closer to downtown, and it began to decline as the very wealthy moved to 
Rockcliffe Park.  The neighbourhood became much denser and more 
middle class.  It was predominantly francophone, and the 1960s 
Radio-Canada television network drama  La Cote de Sable  was set there, to this day the network's only drama set outside Quebec.


The area saw much growth at the end of the 
Second World War as the 
baby boom increased the population and the nearby federal government began hiring.  Many of the once grand mansions became 
embassies. Many nations still have their embassies in Sandy Hill, including those of 

Russia
 and of many 






Africa





n nations, which are clustered near the Rideau River. Its population dropped by 30% in the 60's and 70's as families fled the dismal urban planning.  Currently, there are many students living in the area due to its proximity to the University of Ottawa.




Geography





A pair of houses on Laurier St E. Many of the large older buildings in Sandy Hill have been converted into apartments.



Unusual among modern urban neighbourhoods, the demographics of Sandy Hill change dramatically over just a few blocks. Very wealthy people live near the embassies of the Rideau River, but closer to the university, one finds more students, more senior citizens, and more poor people living in boarding houses. The area is split about equally between the 

English
 speaking and the 
francophone population, with large communities from 

Somalia
, 

Lebanon
, and 

Haiti
. The area is very close to downtown, especially to the 

Rideau Centre
, Ottawa's premier shopping area.  The area is well served by 
mass transit and the 
transitway passes by the university.


Sandy Hill is often divided into four areas.  Upper Sandy Hill consists of the area north of 



Laurier Avenue


.  This part of the neighbourhood is much older with many of its buildings dating from the nineteenth century. The area is subject to the  influences of more recent developments on the thoroughfare of 



Rideau Street


.  South of Laurier is Lower Sandy Hill largely built after the 
Second World War, though there are a number of much older structures.  The far south of neighbourhood below Mann Avenue is an area known as Strathcona Heights.  This area is much smaller geographically than the other two but is as densely populated.  It consists almost entirely of low-rise apartment buildings that are either subsidised housing or co-operatives.  This area was completely redeveloped in the early 1990s.  The area below the Strathcona Heights escarpment, near the Rideau River, is known as Robinson village.  It was cut off from other neighbourhoods when highways were built, and contains low-rise houses and light industrial uses.

Where's George?

Where's George? LLC

English




Where's George? (abbreviated WG?) is a 
website that tracks the natural geographic circulation of 








American







 
paper money. Its popularity has led to the establishment of a number of other 
currency tracking websites, sites that track other objects such as used books and it has been used in at least one research paper to provide statistical patterns of human travel in the 








United States







.1

As of 
October 8, 
2008, Where's George? has tracked over 138 
million bills totaling more than $754 million.



Overview


The site was established in December 1998 by Hank Eskin, a database consultant in 

Brookline
, 

Massachusetts
.2 Where's George? refers to 





George Washington




, whose portrait appears on the 
one-dollar bill. In addition to the one-dollar bill, 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 50- and 100-dollar denominations can be tracked. The one-dollar bill is by far the most popular denomination, followed by 
20-dollar bills.3


To track a bill, a user enters the local 
ZIP Code and the serial number and series of any United States 
denomination. International users are also able to participate using an extensive database of unique codes assigned to non-American/Canadian locations. Once a bill is registered, the site reports the time between sightings, the distance traveled between locations, and any comments from the finders (called  user notes ). 


The site does not track bills older than series 1969, except for one- and two-dollar bills produced in series 1963 or later. 


Where's George? is supported by 
advertising, sales of T-shirts and other memorabilia, and by users who pay a fee for extra features.2 Users who pay a $7/month fee are entered into the  Friends of Where's George?  program, a program which allows these users to cruise the website advertisement free, access certain features others cannot, and refresh reports on the user's entered bills.4 Eskin states that the  Friends of Where's George?  program will always be optional and payment to use the site will always be at the individual's prerogative.4




Hits


A hit is when a bill registered with Where's George? is re-entered into the database. Where's George? does not have specific goals other than tracking currency movements, but many users like to collect interesting patterns of hits, called 
bingos. The most common bingo involves getting at least one hit in all 50 states (called  50 state bingo ). Another Bingo, FRB Bingo, is when a user gets hits on bills from all 12 
Federal Reserve Banks.5


Most bills do not receive any responses, or hits, but many bills receive two or more hits. The average hit rate is slightly over 11.1%. Double- and triple-hitters are common, and bills with 4 or 5 hits are not unheard of. Almost daily a bill receives its 6th hit. The site record is held by a $1 bill with 15 entries.6


To increase the chance of having a bill reported, users (called  Georgers ) may write or stamp text on the bills encouraging bill finders to visit www.wheresgeorge.com and track the bill's travels.2 Bills that are entered into the database, but not marked, are known as stealths.


The website, however, does not encourage the defacement of U.S. Currency. In April 2000, it was investigated by the 

United States Secret Service
, which informed the webmaster that the selling of  Where's George?  rubber stamps on the web site is considered  advertising  on United States currency, which is illegal under 18 U.S.C. | 475.7 The web site immediately ceased selling rubber stamps and no further action against the site was taken.2 At least one spokesperson for the US Secret Service has pointed out in print that marking US bills, even if not defacement, is still illegal for other reasons8 under 





18 U.S.C.




 
| 475; however, the general view is that using Where's George? rubber stamps on currency is not illegal per se.9 One Secret Service spokesman in 

Seattle
, 





Washington




 told 

The Seattle Times
 in 2004:  Quite frankly, we wouldn't spend too much looking into this. 2




Where's George? and geocaching





Examples of marked bills.



The phenomenon of 
geocaching, in which small items are left in obscure places for others to find using 
GPS systems, has resulted in a problem. Some geocachers leave Where's George? bills, which can artificially inflate the number of hits for that bill and disrupt the intent of the site, to track money's natural movement. 


The Where's George? site says it  prohibits trading or exchanging bills with friends, family or anyone known to the bill distributor for the purpose of re-entry. 1011 This rule is to encourage natural circulation of the currency, and to prevent multiple fake hits from happening on any bill. As a result, all bills containing the word  geocache  or  cache  are tagged as a geocache bill. The site has also dropped a separate listing of  Top 10 Geocache bills  and is cautioning that if geocache sites are used too often,  all Geocache bills will be removed from this site. 12




George Score


The  George Score  is a method of rating users based on how many bills they have entered and also by how many total hits they have had.2 The formula is as follows:


100\times\left[\sqrt{\ln({\rm bills\ entered})}+\ln({\rm hits}+1)\right]\times[1-({\rm days\ of\ inactivity}/100)]


This logarithmic formula means that the more bills a user enters and the more hits the user receives, the less the user's score increases for each entered bill or new hit. Thus, a user's score does not increase as quickly when the user has entered many bills. The #1 user, 
Wattsburg Gary, has an Unofficial George Score of 1,591.51 (as of 
September 27, 
2008), and was the first user to break the 1500-George-Score mark and the one-million hit mark. Gary has entered over 1,028,000 bills.13


Although there is a scoring system, the site makes it clear that this is not intended to be a contest. The site also prohibits marking bills and depositing them into financial institutions en masse.1014




Community


Where's George? includes a community of users that interact via forums. They are divided into several categories, ranging from regional to new-member-help threads. Some members of the site also participate in gatherings, held in various cities around the United States. Several have become annual events, and can vary widely in scope and size.15




Use in research


Although Where's George? does not officially recognize the bills that travel the farthest or fastest, some have approached it as a semi-serious way to track patterns in the flow of American cash.


Money flow displayed through Where's George was used in a 2006 research paper that described statistical laws of human travel in the United States, and developed a mathematical model of the spread of infectious disease resulting from such travel. The article is in the 
January 26, 
2006 issue of the journal 

Nature
.16 Researchers found that 57% of the nearly half a million dollar bills studied traveled between 30 miles and 500 miles over approximately nine months in the United States.17 There is a short clip of a Brockman presentation on the subject from the IdeaFestival on 

YouTube
.18

The small town of Rye, in 

East Sussex
, 

England
, stands at the confluence of two rivers, although in medieval times, as an important member of the 
Cinque Ports, it was at the head of an embayment of the 




English Channel



, almost entirely surrounded by the sea. It is officially a 
civil parish but with its historic roots has the status of a town; it has a population of 4009 (2001 census). During its history its association with the sea has included being involved with smuggling gangs of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Those historic roots make it a tourist destination, and much of its economy is based on that: there are a number of hotels and restaurants, as well as other attractions, catering for the visitor. There is small fishing fleet, and the Harbour has facilities for yachts and other vessels.
A known 





Demonym




 for the people who live in the town is 'Ryer's' and in Sussex they are sometimes referred to as 'Mud Heads' 1.




History





Location of medieval Rye






Details of Rye's history may be found at the Rye Castle Museum website 2, from which much of the following is taken''


Further details are to be found at Vision of Britain 3




Until the end of the 
Wealden iron industry (and probably in Roman times) Rye was important as a place of shipment and storage of iron, especially armaments. 










Camber Castle









 was built by 


Henry VIII

, one of five built to protect this coast. 


The medieval map shows that Rye was then located on a large bay: the River Rother (not shown) took an easterly course to flow into the sea at Romney. The town was to become a limb of the Cinque Ports by 1189, and subsequently a full member. The violent storms of later centuries (particularly the 13th) were to cut the town off from the sea; and, when the River Rother (which had by now changed its course) and the sea combined in about 1375 to destroy the eastern part of the town, ships began use the current area (the Strand) to off-load their cargoes. In the same century the town wall was completed 4 as a defence against foreign raiders. 




Constant work had to be undertaken to stop the gradual silting-up of the river: 
Acts of Parliament had to be passed to enable it to be kept navigable. Even so, Rye was considered one of the finest of the Cinque Ports. With the coming of bigger ships and larger ports, Rye's economy began to decline, and fishing and particularly 
smuggling became more important. Imposition of taxes on goods had already encouraged the latter trade since 1301, but by the end of the 17th  century it became widespread throughout Kent and Sussex, with wool being the largest commodity. When luxury goods were also added, smuggling became a criminal pursuit, and groups - such as the 


Hawkhurst Gang

 who met in the Mermaid Inn Rye - turned to murder and were subsequently hanged. 


Since 1803 there have been 
lifeboats stationed at Rye5 although the lifeboat station is now named Rye Harbour. The worst disaster in its history occurred in 1928, when the vessel (the 
The Mary Stanford of Rye'' sank with all hands. The incident is recorded by a tablet at 

Winchelsea
 church; and by the folk-song The Mary Stanford of Rye6 . Between 1696 and 1948 there have been six ships of the 




Royal Navy



 to bear the name 
HMS Rye.




Governance


Although officially considered to be a 
civil parish 7, Rye s governing body - because of its history - is that of a Town Council. That Council has one electoral ward, electing 16 members, one of whom then is elected Mayor of Rye.8. The current Mayor (2008-9) is Cllr Samuel Souster (Labour).


The 
Member of Parliament for the combined constituency of Hastings and Rye is 







Michael Jabez Foster






.




Geography


Rye is located at the point where the sandstone high land of the 
Weald reaches the coast. The medieval coastline (see map above), with its large bay, allowed ships to come up to the port. The original course of the River Rother then reached the sea at Romney to the north-east. The storms in the English Channel in the thirteenth century, coupled with 
reclamation of the bay, brought huge quantities of gravel through 
longshore drift along the coast, blocking the entrance to the port. The course of the river has also changed over the centuries, so that Rye now stands on the river, at the point of its 
confluence with the 



River Tillingham


. 


The river itself, now flowing southward into Rye Bay, and the environs of Rye Harbour, are managed and maintained by the Environment Agency 9



Mermaid Street showing typically steep slope and cobbled surface



Most of the town lies on the original rocky heights and contains the historic buildings including St Mary's parish church, the Ypres Tower (part of the Town Wall), 


Lamb House

 and many of the houses on Mermaid Street, Watchbell Street, and Church Square. The main road skirts the town to the south after crossing the river; before that point there is some ribbon development along the Hastings road.




Demography and economy


Rye, apart from its tourist base, continues to operate as a port. The fishing fleet (code-lettered RX, Rye, SusseX) lands fish daily, and some is sold at the Strand quay. 




Transport


At the latter end of the 18th century, Rye was connected to the 
Turnpike Trust system of roads. One of these, the Flimwell Turnpike, took passengers towards London10; the second ran from Hastings eastwards through the town. These two roads are now the 

A258
 and the 

A259
.  


In addition to the hourly 711 Dover-Hastings Stagecoach long-distance service there are a number of buses connecting Rye with other towns and villages, including 

Tenterden
, Hastings and 

Tunbridge Wells
 11.


Rye has a 

railway station
 on the 




 Marshlink 



 line between Hastings and Ashford.12


Several 
long-distance footpaths can be joined by walkers in the town. The 








Saxon Shore Way







 which starts at 

Gravesend
, 

Kent
 and traces the coast as it was in 

Roman
 times, passes through Rye en route to  

Hastings
; the 




1066 Country Walk



 leads from Rye to 

Pevensey
; the 




High Weald Landscape Trail



 goes to 

Horsham
; and the 
Royal Military Canal Path follows that waterway to 

Hythe
.




Education


Thomas Peacocke Community College is Rye's secondary school. The two primary schools, Tilling Green Infant School and Freda Gardham Community School, will be replaced by a new school in September 2008.




Amenities


Rye is a local centre as well as being a tourist spot.  Rye Farmers  Market13 takes place on Strand Quay every Thursday morning; and a general market antiques, collectors' book and record shops and many art galleries, selling works by local artists and potters with changing exhibitions throughout the year. A general weekly market takes place by the station every Thursday.


One of the tourist websites includes a picture tour of the town 14




Rye in literature


There are various mentions of the town by famous travel writers between the 16th and 18th centuries, although not all to the good. Sir 






Robert Naunton





 (1563 1635) mentions it in his book Travels in England, published sometime between 1628 and 1632: he calls Rye a  small English seaport ; shortly after his arrival he takes post-horses for London, travelling via Flimwell. 


Daniel Defoe

 (1660 1731)  describes the state of the harbour and its approaches, saying that   Rye would flourish again, if her harbour, which was once able to receive the royal navy, cou'd be restor'd       but that he thought it very doubtful that large ships would be able to use the port again. 15 









William Cobbett








 (1763 1835) simply mentions it in passing, saying that this area (that including the Romney Marsh) would be most likely to be where the French invaders might land.  





Lamb House





Rye has produced and attracted many fiction writers, some of whom lived at Lamb House, one of the town's historic residences and now owned by the 

National Trust
16 They include




Henry James


 (1843 1916), the American novelist, who was resident between 1898 and 1916; 











Rumer Godden










 (1907 98), the Anglo-Indian novelist; and 
E.F. Benson (1867 1940), the English novelist. Both the House and the town feature prominently in Benson's 
Mapp and Lucia novels, as Mallards House and 
Tilling respectively. In the mid 1980s Rye was used as a filming location by 
LWT for its adaptation of the 
Mapp and Lucia novels.




People of Rye

 
Other residents of the town and environs have included:



 










Conrad Aiken









 (1889 1973), American writer. Aiken's former home, Jeake's House, is now a guest house.

Calling (B'z song)


A game call is a device that is used to mimic animal noises to attract or drive animals to a 
hunter.


Many hunters can be divided into two categories. The first group sits silent, motionless and hidden until a game animal wanders or flies into view. This tried-and-true hunting method takes plenty of game, but some people prefer a more 'active' approach. This group of hunters also remains hidden, but they make plenty of noise. They are wildlife callers, and their success depends on producing a convincing enough reproduction of an animal s calls to convince a game animal to come to them.


But, you can t simply buy a call, head to the woods and reap the rewards of game flooding to your calls. Just like any activity, becoming a competent caller takes practice and education. No matter if your interest lies in calling turkeys, waterfowl, deer, elk or whatever, each call demands the appropriate calling technique, and the only way to become competent is to learn what the call should sound like, how much to call, where and when to call, and a long list of others.



 A variety of animal species are attracted to game calls

The Texas Ranger Division, commonly called the Texas Rangers, is a 
law enforcement agency with statewide 
jurisdiction based in 

Austin
, the capital of 


Texas

, in the United States. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption, acted as 
riot police and as detectives, protected the 
Texas governor, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a 
paramilitary force at the service of both the 

Republic
 (1836 45) and the state of Texas. 


The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by 







Stephen F. Austin






 in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. It was dissolved by the federal authorities during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, but was quickly reformed upon the reinstitution of home government. Since 1935, the organization has been a division of the 


Texas Department of Public Safety

; it fulfills the role of Texas's 
State Bureau of Investigation. As of 2007, there are 134 commissioned members of the Ranger force. It has been called the oldest state-level 
law enforcement agency in the United States.


The Rangers have taken part in many of the most important events of Texas history and were involved in some of the best-known criminal cases in the history of the 
Old West, such as those of 
gunfighter 







John Wesley Hardin






, bank robber 







Sam Bass






, and outlaws 
Bonnie and Clyde. Scores of books have been written about the Rangers, from well researched works of nonfiction to 
pulp novels, making them significant participants in the mythology of the Wild West. During their long history, a distinct Ranger tradition has evolved; their cultural significance to Texans is such that they are legally protected against disbandment.

Texas in the Civil War



State of Texas





By the early 1820s, the 

Mexican War of Independence
 had subsided, and some 600 to 700 families had settled in Texas most of them from the United States. Because there was no regular army to protect the citizens against attacks by 

Native Americans
 and bandits, in 1823, Stephen F. Austin organized small, informal armed groups whose duties required them to range over the countryside, and who thus came to be known as  rangers . Around August 4, 1823, Austin wrote that he would  ... employ ten men ... to act as rangers for the common defense ... the wages I will give said ten men is fifteen dollars a month payable in property ... 1 John Jackson Tumlinson Sr., the first alcalde of the Colorado district, is considered by many Texas Ranger historians to be the first Texas Ranger killed in the line of duty. Texas Rangers date the anniversary year of their organization to this event.


However, it was not until 1835 that the Texas Rangers were formally constituted, when Austin returned to Texas after having been imprisoned in 


Mexico City

. Upon his return, Austin helped organize a council to govern the group. On October 17, at a consultation of the Provisional Government of Texas, 
Daniel Parker proposed a resolution to establish the Texas Rangers, totaling some 60 men distributed among three companies. This was instituted by Texas lawmakers on November 24. On November 28, 1835 
Robert McAlpin Williamson was chosen to be the first Major of the Texas Rangers. Within two years the Rangers comprised more than 300 men.


In their early days, Rangers performed tasks of protecting the Texas Frontier against Indian attacks on the settlers. During the 

Texas Revolution
, they served mainly as scouts, spies, couriers, and guides for the settlers fleeing before the Mexican Army and performed rear guard during the 
Runaway Scrape and general support duties. These minor roles continued after independence, when the region became the 

Republic of Texas
 under President 

Sam Houston
. Houston, who had lived with the 

Cherokee
 for many years (and who had taken a Cherokee wife), favored peaceful coexistence with Indians, a policy that left little space for a force with the Rangers' characteristics. 


This situation changed radically when 

Mirabeau B. Lamar
 became president in December 1838. Lamar had participated in skirmishes with the Cherokee in his home state of 

Georgia
;  like most Texans, he had not forgotten the support the Cherokee had given the Mexicans at the 
Cordova Rebellion against the Republic. He favored the eradication of Indians in Texas a view that he shared with Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 

Thomas Rusk
. Lamar saw in the Rangers the perfect tool for the task, and he obtained permission from the 

Texas Legislature
 to raise a force of 56 Rangers, along with other volunteer companies. During the following three years, he engaged the Rangers in a war against the Cherokee and the 

Comanche
 and succeeded in weakening their territorial control. 2




Mexican American War





Capt. 








John Coffee  Jack  Hays














Sam Houston was re-elected President of Texas on December 12, 1841. He had taken note of the Rangers' cost-efficiency and increased their number to 150. Under Captain 








John Coffee  Jack  Hays







's leadership, the force played an important role in the defense against the Mexican invasion led by General 
Adrian Woll in 1842 and against attacks by Indians. Despite his youth at the time, the charismatic Hays was a rallying figure to his men and is often considered responsible for giving cohesion, discipline and a group mentality to the Rangers. Flacco, a chief of the allied Indian tribe of the 





Lipan




, used to call Hays Bravo too much.3 The adoption of the state-of-the-art five-shot 

Colt
 
revolver (which had been turned down by the 
U.S. Army) was also his work. Hays trained his men to aim, fire and reload their weapons from horseback, a radical innovation from the usual contemporary technique of dismounting before shooting at enemies and reloading, which was a necessity with more cumbersome weaponry. This tactic was put to devastating effect, and it was imitated shortly afterwards by the military.4 At the suggestion of one of Hays's officers, 

Samuel Hamilton Walker
, these revolvers soon evolved into the famous, enhanced six-shot version, the 

Walker Colt
. During these years, famous Rangers such as Hays, Walker, 















Benjamin McCulloch














 and 

William  Bigfoot  Wallace
 first established their reputation as frontier fighters.

With the annexation of Texas within the United States and the 
Mexican American War in 1846, several companies of Rangers were mustered into federal service and proved themselves at the battles of 
Palo Alto and 
Resaca de la Palma. From that moment on, their effectiveness as 
guerrilla fighters and guides to the 
federal army through a territory that they were familiar with marked the pace of the American offensive. Rangers played an important role in the battles of 
Monterrey and 
Buena Vista. The army, commanded by General 

Winfield Scott
, landed at 

Veracruz
 in March 1847, and the Rangers once again provided valuable support at the ensuing 

Siege of Veracruz
 and the battles of 

Cerro Gordo
 and 

Chapultepec
. They were also responsible for the defeat of the fierce Mexican guerrilleros that hindered the advance of the federal troops, which they achieved ruthlessly and efficiently. By then, the Rangers had earned themselves a considerable reputation that approached the legendary among Mexicans, and when Ranger companies entered and occupied Mexico City with the U.S. Army in September 1847, los Diablos Tejanos (the  Texas Devils ) were received with reverence and fear.5 Their role in the Mexican American War also won them nationwide fame in the United States and news of their exploits, in the contemporary press became common, effectively establishing the Rangers as part of American folklore. As the Victoria Advocate reported in the November 16, 1848, issue:




Four newly raised ranging companies, have all been organized, and taken their several stations on our frontier. We are much pleased. We know they are true men, and they know exactly what they are about. With many of them Indian and Mexican fighting has been their trade for years. That they may be permanently retained in the service on our frontier is extremely desirable, and we cannot permit ourselves to doubt such will be the case.6


Despite these popular stories and their fame, some of their most brutal interventions, such as the massacre of unarmed civilians, elderly men, women and children in Saltillo, ordered by Samuel H. Walker, remained unknown to the American public at large. Most of the Ranger force was disbanded during the years following the end of the Mexican American War on February 2, 1848, since the protection of the frontiers was now an official duty of the U.S. Army. But as more settlers sought to establish homesteads in lands traditionally occupied by Indians, the skirmishes with the native peoples became a major political issue. During the 1850s, the Rangers were intermittently called on to deal with this problem, and with the election of 














Hardin Richard Runnels













 as governor in 1857, they once again regained their role as defenders of the Texas frontier. 


On January 27, 1858, Runnels allocated $70,000 to fund a force of Rangers, and 












John Salmon  Rip  Ford











, a veteran Ranger of the war with Mexico, was commissioned as senior captain. With a force of some 100 Rangers, Ford began a large expedition against the Comanche and other tribes, whose raids against the settlers and their properties had become common. On May 12, Ford's Rangers, accompanied by 



Tonkawa


, 
Anadarko and 

Shawnee
 scouts from the 
Brazos Reservation in Texas, crossed the 





Red River




 into 
Indian Territory and attacked a Comanche village in the 



Canadian River


 Valley, flanked by the 




Antelope Hills



 in what is now 





Oklahoma




. Suffering only four casualties, the force killed a reported 76 Comanche (including a chief by the name of Iron Jacket) and took 18 prisoners and 300 
horses.


In December 1859, Ford and his company were assigned to 

Brownsville
, in south Texas, where the local Mexican rancher 











Juan Cortina










 had launched an attack and briefly occupied the town and later conducted a series of guerrilla actions and raids against local American landowners. Together with a regiment of the U.S. Army commanded by Major 














Samuel P. Heintzelman













 (who later became a notable general of the 
Union in the 

Civil War
), Ford's Rangers took part in the 






Cortina War





, and on December 27, 1859, they engaged and defeated Cortina's forces in the battle of 
Rio Grande City. Pursued and defeated by Ford and his Rangers again a few days later, Cortina retreated into Mexico, and although he would continue to promote minor actions against the Texan ranchers, the threat of a large-scale military incursion was effectively ended.


The success of these campaigns marked a turning point in Rangers' history. The U.S. Army could provide only limited and thinly stretched protection in the enormous territory of Texas. In contrast, the Rangers' effectiveness when dealing with these threats convinced both the people of the state and the political leaders that a well-funded and organized local Ranger force was essential. Such a force could use the deep familiarity with the territory and the proximity with the theater of operations as major advantages in its favor. This option was not pursued in the light of the emerging national political problems, and the Rangers dissolved until 1874. However, the conviction of their usefulness had become firmly established, and the agency was eventually reconstituted.7




Civil War and late 19th century

After Texas 
seceded from the United States in 1861 during the American Civil War, many Rangers enlisted individually to fight for the 

Confederacy
, such as 

Walter P. Lane
, George W. Baylor, 

Thomas S. Lubbock
, 















Benjamin McCulloch














, 
















Henry Eustace McCulloch















, 
John B. Jones, 







Leander H. McNelly






 and 












John Ford











. Although the famous Eighth Texas Cavalry regiment was widely known as 

Terry's Texas Rangers
, neither its leader and founder, Benjamin Franklin Terry, nor the majority of its members had been affiliated with the state agency. The fact that both groups have often been regarded as related (and Terry's men themselves had thus adopted the organization's name) speaks of the widespread fame that the Rangers had achieved by that time. During the Civil War, the duties of scouting the state frontiers for 
Union troops, hostile Indians and deserters devolved upon those who could not be drafted into the Confederate Army because of their age or other disabilities. This mixed group was never officially considered a Ranger force, although their work was essentially the same. Ironically in April 1865 General 

John A. Wharton
 of the  Terry's Texas Rangers  was shot and killed after an argument with George W. Baylor-who served in the Texas Rangers Frontier Battalion after the Civil War until 1882.


During 





Reconstruction




, the Rangers were replaced by a Union-controlled 


Texas State Police

. Charged with enforcing unpopular new laws that came with reintegration, that organization fell into disrepute.8 The TSP only existed from July 22, 1870 to April 22, 1873.


The scenario changed radically for the Rangers with the state election of 1873. When newly elected Governor 











Richard Coke










 took office in January 1874, it marked the end of Reconstruction for the Lone Star State, and he vigorously restored order to Texas in pursuit of improvements to both the economy and security. Once again Indians and Mexican bandits were threatening the frontiers, and once again the Rangers were tasked with solving the problem. That same year, the state 

legislature
 authorized the recommissioning of the Rangers,9 and a special force was created within its aegis: the Frontier Battalion, consisting of six companies of 75 men each under the command of Major 
John B. Jones. This group played a major role in the control of ordinary lawbreakers as well as the  defense against hostile Indian tribes, which was particularly necessary in the period of lawlessness and social collapse of the Reconstruction.

The Frontier Battalion was soon augmented with the Special Force, a second military group of 40 men under Captain 







Leander H. McNelly






, with the specific task of bringing order in the area of south Texas between the 



Nueces River


 and the 

Rio Grande
, called the 
Nueces Strip. At this particular region, the general situation of lawlessness was aggravated by the proximity of Texas to Mexico and the conflict between agrarian and cattle interests. Raids along the frontier were common, and not only perpetrated by ordinary bandits but also promoted by local Mexican 
caudillos. In particular, Juan Cortina's men were again conducting periodic guerrilla operations against local ranchers. In the following two years, McNelly and his group energetically engaged these threats and virtually eradicated them.10A 2nd Sgt of J. R. Waller's  A  Company was

It was at these times that many of the Rangers' myths were born, such as their success in capturing or killing notorious criminals and 
desperados (including bank robber 







Sam Bass






 and gunfighter 







John Wesley Hardin






) and their decisive role in the defeat of the Comanche, the 

Kiowa
 and the 
Apache peoples. It was also during these years that the Rangers suffered the only defeat in their history when they surrendered at the 
Salinero Revolt in 1877. Despite the fame of their deeds, the conduct of the Rangers during this period was questionable. In particular, McNelly and his men used ruthless methods that often rivaled the brutality of their opponents, such as taking part in 
summary executions and confessions induced by 
torture and intimidation.11 McNelly also made himself famous for disobeying direct orders from his superiors on several occasions, and breaking through the Mexican frontier for self-appointed law enforcement purposes.12 Arguably, these methods either sowed the seeds of discontent among Mexican-Americans or restored order to the frontier. After McNelly's retirement because of health problems, the Special Force was dissolved in 1877 and their members absorbed into the Frontier Battalion, which continued to function even after Jones's death in the line of duty in 1881. By the last years of the 19th century, a high measure of security within the vast frontier of Texas had been achieved, in which the Rangers had played a primary role.




Mexican Revolution and early 20th century


At the beginning of the 20th century, Texas's frontiers had become more settled, thus rendering the 1874 legislation obsolete after the organization had existed as a quasi-military force for more than 25 years. Amidst serious legal troubles that questioned the authority of the Rangers to exert such a role, new resolutions appropriate to the current times were adopted. The Frontier Battalion was disbanded with the passing of new legislation on July 8, 1901, and a new Ranger force was created, consisting of four companies of  no more than 20 men each  with a captain in command of every unit. The Rangers had evolved into an agency with an exclusive law enforcement focus.

The 














Mexican Revolution













 that began in 1910 against 

President
 
Porfirio Diaz changed the relatively peaceful state of affairs along the border. Soon after, violence on both sides of the frontier escalated as bands of Mexicans took over border towns and began crossing the Rio Grande on a near-daily basis.  Taking over trade routes in Mexico by establishing themselves as 
road agents, Mexican banditos turned towards attacking the American communities for kidnapping, extortion, and supplies.  As Mexican law enforcement disintegrated with the collapse of the Diaz regime, these gangs grouped themselves under the various caudillos on both sides of the border and took sides in the civil war, most simply to take advantage of the turmoil to loot.13  Then, as the lack of American military forces for defending the border became clearer, the scope of the activities soon turned to outright genocide with the intention of driving Americans out of the Southwest entirely; this became known as the Plan de San Diego in 1915.  In several well-rehearsed attacks, Mexicans rose up and in conjunction with raiding 

Villista
 guerrillas, within weeks had killed over 500 Texan women, children, and men.14  


The political decision of the Texans was to restore control and order by any necessary means. As Governor 

Oscar Branch Colquitt
 instructed Ranger Captain John R. Hughes: ...you and your men are to keep Mexican raiders off of Texas territory if possible, and if they invade the State let them understand they do so at the risk of their lives.15 Hundreds of new special Rangers were appointed by order of the state, which neglected to carefully screen aspiring members. Rather than conduct themselves as law enforcement officers, many of these groups acted more like 
vigilante squads. Reports of Rangers abusing their authority and breaking the law themselves increased.16 The situation grew even more dramatic when on March 9, 1916, 

Pancho Villa
 led 1,500 Mexican raiders in a cross-border attack against 

Columbus
, 





New Mexico




, increasing the high tension that had already existed between the communities.


The final straw was the killing of innocent villagers, wrongly accused of raiding the Brite Ranch Store on 

Christmas Day
 in 1917. In January 1918 a heavily armed group of Texas Rangers, ranchmen and members a troop of U.S. Cavalry descended upon the tiny community of Porvenir, Texas on the Mexican border in western Presidio County. The Rangers and company rounded up the inhabitants of the village and searched their homes.  They then proceeded to gather all the men in Provenir (fifteen Mexican men and boys ranging in age from 16 to 72 years) and march them off into the darkness. A short distance from Porvenir, the men were lined up against a rock bluff and shot to death. The victims were Manuel Morales, 47, who possessed a deed to 1,600 acres (6.5 km2), Roman Nieves, 48, who possessed a deed to 320 acres (1.3 km2), Longino Flores, 44, Alberto Garcia, 35, Eutimio Gonzales, 37, Macedonio Huertas, 30, Tiburcio Jaques, 50, Ambrosio Hernandez, 21, Antonio Castanedo, 72, Pedro Herrera, 25, Viviano Herrera, 23, Severiano Herrera, 18, Pedro Jimenez, 27, Serapio Jimenez, 25, and Juan Jimenez, 16. In January 1919, the Porvenir massacre came under the scrutiny of the Texas House and Senate Investigation of the State Ranger Force.


Before the decade was over, thousands of lives were lost, Texans and Mexicans alike. In January 1919, at the initiative of Representative Jose T. Canales of Brownsville, the Texas Legislature launched a full investigation of Rangers' actions throughout these years. The investigation found that from 300 up to 5,000 people, mostly of Hispanic descent, had been killed by Rangers from 1910 to 1919 and that members of the Rangers had been involved in many acts of brutality and injustice.17


These were the most turbulent times in the history of the Rangers, and with the objective of recycling the force's membership, putting it back in tune with its past and restoring the public's trust, the Legislature passed on March 31, 1919, a resolution to purge it and enhance it and its procedures. All special Ranger groups were disbanded; the four official companies were kept, albeit their members were reduced from 20 to 15 each; better payment was offered in order to attract men of higher personal standards; and a method for citizens to articulate complaints against any further misdeeds or abuses was established.

Brownsville
 Customs House during 
Prohibition, December 20, 1920





The reforms proved positive, and the new Ranger force eventually regained the status of a respectable agency. Under the command of captains such as 












Frank Hamer











 (who later became famous for leading the party that killed the outlaws 
Bonnie and Clyde), the Rangers displayed remarkable activity in the following years, including the continuous fighting of cattle rustlers, intervening in the violent labor disputes of the time and protecting the citizenry involved in 





Ku Klux Klan




's public displays from violent mob reaction. With the passage of the 
Volstead Act and the beginning of the 
Prohibition on January 16, 1920, their duties extended to scouting the border for 
tequila smugglers and detecting and dismantling the illegal 
stills that abounded along Texas's territory.


One of the Rangers' highest-profile interventions during this period was taming Texas's oil 
boomtowns (beginning with 

Spindletop
's discovery in 1901), which had developed into lawless territories. During the 1920s, 
martial law was decreed on several of these towns, such as 

Mexia
 and 

Borger
; at others, like 
Desdemona, 

Wink
, 

Ranger
, 
Kilgore and 

Burkburnett
, the situation was also very serious, and the Rangers were called in to quell agitated locals and terminate all illegal activities. This trouble continued until well in the 1950s, but the Rangers prevented it from growing into an even more dramatic problem. At Borger, a total of ten officers were sent on April 7, 1927, including Capt. Hamer. The balance of the Rangers' activities upon their arrival as reported was:
A thorough-going clean-up was put underway. The liquor traffic was broken up, many stills being seized and destroyed, and several thousand gallons of whiskey being captured and poured out. Two hundred and three gambling slot machines were seized and destroyed, and in a period of twenty four hours, no less than twelve hundred prostitutes left the town of Borger.13




Modernization and present day


The 





Great Depression




 forced both the federal and state governments to cut down on personnel and funding of their organizations, and the Rangers were no exception. The number of commissioned officers was reduced to 45, and the only means of transportation afforded to Rangers were free railroad passes, or using their personal horses. The situation worsened for the agency when its members entangled themselves in politics in 1932 by publicly supporting Governor 
Ross Sterling in his re-election campaign, over his opponent 

Miriam Amanda  Ma  Ferguson
. Ferguson was elected, and immediately after taking office in January 1933, she proceeded to discharge all serving Rangers. The force also saw its salaries and funds slashed by the Texas Legislature, and their numbers reduced further to 32 men. The result was that Texas became a safe hideout for the many Depression-era gangsters escaping from the law, such as 
Bonnie and Clyde, 













George  Machine Gun  Kelly












, 




Pretty Boy Floyd



 and 








Raymond Hamilton







. The hasty appointment of many unqualified Rangers to stop the increasing criminality proved ineffective.18

The general disorganization of law enforcement in the state convinced the members of the Legislature that a thorough revision of the public security system was in order, and with that purpose it hired the services of a consulting firm from 

Chicago
. The resulting report yielded many worrying conclusions, but the basic underlying facts were simple: the criminality levels in Texas were extremely high, and the state's means to fight them were underfunded, undermanned, loose, disorganized and obsolete. The consultants' recommendation, besides increasing funding, was to introduce a whole reorganization of state security agencies; especially, to merge the Rangers with the 


Texas Highway Patrol

 under a new agency called the 


Texas Department of Public Safety

 (DPS). After deliberating, the Legislature agreed with the suggestion. The resolution that created the new state law enforcement agency was passed in 1935, and with an initial budget of $450,000, the DPS became operational on August 10.


With minor rearrangements over the years, the 1935 reforms have ruled the Texas Rangers' organization until present day. Hiring new members, which had been largely a political decision, was achieved through a series of examinations and merit evaluations. Promotion relied on seniority and performance in the line of duty. More sophisticated means of crime fighting were put at their disposal, like automobiles, advanced weaponry and forensics. By the late 1930s, the Rangers had one of the best crime labs in the United States at the Headquarters Division in Austin. The appointment of Colonel Homer Garrison in September 1938 as director of the DPS proved decisive as well. Under his leadership, many respected captains such as 

Manuel T. Gonzaullas
 worked extensively to restore the good name of the force that had been compromised in the previous decades, keeping it in line with its traditions within a modern and civilized society and regaining its high status.13 The number of commissioned officers grew and the Rangers developed a clear detective function, while the Highway Patrol took charge of direct law enforcement duties.



The quality of the force in terms of training, funding, modernization and number strength has continued to improve. In the last few decades, the Rangers have intervened in several thousand cases with a high level of effectiveness,19 including many high-profile ones such as the pursuit and capture of serial killer 
Angel Maturino Resendiz. The agency is also fully integrated with modern Texan ethnic groups, counting numerous officers of Hispanic and 



African American


 origin among its members. Today, the historical importance and symbolism of the Texas Rangers is such that they are protected by statute from being disbanded.20


The Texas Rangers' internal organization still maintains the basic outlines that were set in 1935. The agency is formed into eight companies: six District Companies lettered from  A  to  F , Company  G  - the Unsolved Crimes Investigation Team - and Headquarters Company  H , each commanded by a captain. (Company  G  is functionally a part of Headquarters Company and is commanded by the Headquarters Captain.) The number of personnel is set by the Texas Legislature; 
as of September, 2007, the Texas Rangers number 134 commissioned officers (including one woman), three crime analysts, one 
forensic artist, one fiscal analyst and 17 civilian support personnel (largely women). The Legislature has also made a provision for the appointment of 300 Special Rangers for use in emergency situations.  The statewide headquarters of the Texas Rangers is located in Austin at the Texas DPS headquarters. Many incorrectly assume that 

Waco
 is the Rangers' headquarters, because the 
Ranger Hall of Fame is located there. Since August 31, 2005, the Chief of the Texas Rangers has been 
Senior Captain Ray Coffman. Captain Jim Miller serves as Assistant Chief.


The District Companies' headquarters are distributed in six geographical locations:







Houston
 is the headquarters for Company A, commanded by Capt. Tony Leal.



Garland is the headquarters for Company B, commanded by Capt. Richard H. Sweaney.




Lubbock
 is the headquarters for Company C, commanded by Capt. Randy Prince.




San Antonio
 is the headquarters for Company D, commanded by Capt. Clete Buckaloo.




Midland
 is the headquarters for Company E, commanded by Capt. Barry K. Caver.




Waco
 is the headquarters for Company F, commanded by Capt. Kirby Dendy.




The two statewide companies are based in:







McAllen
 is the headquarters for Company G, commanded by Capt. Skylor Hearn.




Austin
 is the home of Headquarters Company H, commanded by Capt. Gerardo De Los Santos.







Old West image





Capt. 












John  Rip  Ford














 


From its earliest days, the Rangers were surrounded with the mystique of the Old West. And though popular culture's image of the Rangers is typically one of rough living, tough talk and a quick draw, Ranger Captain 












John  Rip  Ford











 described the men who served him thus:


A large proportion ... were unmarried. A few of them drank intoxicating liquors. Still, it was a company of sober and brave men. They knew their duty and they did it. While in a town they made no braggadocio demonstration. They did not gallop through the streets, shoot, and yell. They had a specie of moral discipline which developed moral courage. They did right because it was right.21


As it happened with many Old West myths like 
Billy the Kid or 









Wyatt Earp








, the Rangers' legendary aura was in part a result of the work of sensationalistic writers and the contemporary press, who glorified and embellished their deeds in an idealized manner. The case of the Rangers is, however, unique: it was a collective force that, in exercise of the authority granted by the government, protected Texas against threats considered extremely evil at the time. While some Rangers could be considered criminals wearing badges by a modern observer, many documented tales of bravery and selflessness are also intertwined in the group's history.22


Despite the age of the agency, and the many contributions they've made to law enforcement over their entire history, Texas Rangers developed most of their reputation during the days of the Old West. Of the seventy nine Rangers that have been killed in the line of duty, the most, thirty, were killed during the Old West period of 1858 through 1901. It was also during this period that two of their three most high profile captures or killings took place, the capture of 







John Wesley Hardin






 and the killing of 







Sam Bass






, in addition to the capture of Texas gunman 

Billy Thompson
 and others.23

 One Riot, One Ranger 





Texas Rangers gathered at 

El Paso
 to stop the illegal Maher-Fitzsimmons fight, 1896. At the front row from the left are Adj. General. W. Mabry, and Capts. J. Hughes, J. Brooks, Bill McDonald (author of the famous phrase) and J. Rogers



One of the most enduring phrases associated with the Rangers today is One Riot, One Ranger. It is somewhat 

apocryphal
 in that there was never actually a riot; rather, the phrase was coined by Ranger Captain William  Bill  McDonald, who was sent to 
Dallas in 1896 to prevent the illegal heavyweight prize fight between Pete Maher and 
Bob Fitzsimmons that had been organized by Dan Stuart, and patronized by the eccentric  Hanging Judge  


Roy Bean

.24  According to the story, McDonald's train was met by the mayor, who asked the single Ranger where the other lawmen were. McDonald is said to have replied:  Hell! Ain't I enough?  There's only one prize-fight! 


Although some measure of truth lies within the tale, it is largely an idealized account written by author Bigelow Paine and loosely based on McDonald's statements, published in Paine's classic book Captain Bill McDonald: Texas Ranger in 1909. In truth, the fight had been so heavily publicized that nearly every Ranger was at hand, including all the captains and their superior, Adjutant General Woodford H. Mabry. Many of them were not really sure whether to stop the fight or to attend it; and in fact, other famous lawmen like 









Bat Masterson








 were also present for the occasion. The orders from the governor were clear, however, and the bout was stopped. Stuart then tried to reorganize it in 

El Paso
 and later in 









Langtry








, but the Rangers followed and thwarted his attempts. Finally, the fight took place on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande near Langtry.25
The motto appears on the pedestal of the large bronze statue of a Texas Ranger in the

 airport, contributed in 1961 by Mr. and Mrs. Earle Wyatt.26





High-profile cases


The Texas Rangers have assisted in many high-profile cases throughout the years. Most of them had a short-lived repercussion, while others have received wide coverage by the press and writers alike. However, there are some collars that are deeply entrenched in the Rangers' lore, such as those of outlaw 







John Wesley Hardin






, bank robber 







Sam Bass






, and 
Bonnie and Clyde. 











Sam Bass












Bank robber 







Sam Bass










In 1878, Sam Bass and his gang, who had perpetrated a series of bank and 
stagecoach robberies beginning in 1877, held up two stagecoaches and four trains within twenty-five miles (40 km) of Dallas. The gang quickly found themselves the object of pursuit across North Texas by a special company of Texas Rangers headed by Captain Junius  June  Peak. Bass was able to elude the Rangers until a member of his party, Jim Murphy, turned informer, cut a deal to save himself, and led the law to the gang. As Bass's band rode south, Murphy wrote to Major John B. Jones, commander of the Frontier Battalion of Texas Rangers.  


Jones set up an ambush at 

Round Rock
, where the Bass gang had planned to rob the 

Williamson County
 Bank. On July 19, 1878, Bass and his gang scouted the area before the actual robbery. They bought some tobacco at a store and were noticed by Williamson County  Sheriff Caige Grimes, who approached the group and was shot and killed. A heavy gunfight ensued between the outlaws and the Rangers and local lawmen. A deputy named Moore was mortally wounded, as was Bass. The gang quickly mounted their horses and tried to escape while continuing to fire, and as they galloped away, Bass was shot again in the back by Ranger George Herold. Bass was later found lying helpless in a pasture north of town by the authorities. They took him into custody where he died from his wounds the next day.












John Wesley Hardin












One of Texas's deadliest outlaws, 







John Wesley Hardin






 was reputed to be the meanest man alive, an accolade he supposedly earned by killing a man for snoring. He committed his first murder at age 15 and admitted to killing more than 40 men over 27 years. In May 1874, Hardin killed Charles Webb, the deputy sheriff of 

Brown County
, for which the outlaw was relentlessly pursued. (Officer Webb had been a former Texas Ranger). 







John Barclay Armstrong






, a Texas Ranger known as  McNelly's Bulldog  since he served with the Special Force as a sergeant and Captain Leander McNelly's right hand, asked for permission to arrest the gunman, which was granted.  Pursuing Hardin across 





Alabama




 and into 

Florida
, Armstrong caught up with Hardin in 

Pensacola
. 


After Armstrong, Colt pistol in hand, boarded a train that Hardin and four companions were on, the outlaw shouted,  Texas, by God!  and drew his own pistol. When it was over, one of his gang members was killed, and his three surviving friends were staring at Armstrong s pistol.  Hardin had been knocked unconscious. Armstrong's hat had been pierced by a bullet, but he was uninjured. Hardin was tried for murder, convicted, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Seventeen years later, Hardin was pardoned by Governor 






Jim Hogg





 and released from prison on March 16, 1894. He moved to 

El Paso
, where he began practicing law. On August 19, 1896, he was murdered during a poker game at the Acme Saloon over a personal disagreement.27





Bonnie and Clyde



Frank Hamer, the longtime Ranger captain, left the Rangers in 1932. In 1934, at the request of Col. Lee Simmons, head of the Texas prison system, Hamer was asked to use his skills to track down Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, whose 
Barrow gang had engineered a successful breakout of associates imprisoned at 

Huntsville
. Prisoner and Barrow friend Joe Palmer had killed a guard while escaping, and the Barrow gang was responsible for many murders, robberies, and 
car thefts in Texas alone.


After tracking the Barrow gang across nine states, Hamer, in conjunction with officials in 





Louisiana




, learned that Bonnie and Clyde had visited a home in 

Bienville Parish
 on May 21, 1934, and that Clyde had designated a rendezvous point in the vicinity with gang member Henry Methvin, in case they were later separated. Methvin, allegedly cooperating with law enforcement, made sure that he was separated from them that evening in 

Shreveport
, and the posse set up an ambush along the route to the rendezvous at Highway 154, between 












Gibsland











 and 
Sailes. Led by former Rangers Hamer and B. M.  Manny  Gault, the posse included Sheriff Henderson Jordan and Deputy Prentiss Oakley of Bienville Parish, Louisiana, and Dallas County Deputies Bob Alcorn and 







Ted Hinton






.  They were in place by 9:00 that night, waiting all through the next day, but with no sign of Bonnie and Clyde.


Around 9:00 a.m. on May 23, the posse, concealed in the bushes and almost ready to concede defeat, heard Clyde's stolen Ford V-8 approaching. When he stopped to speak with Henry Methvin's father (planted there with his truck that morning to distract Clyde and force him into the lane closest to the posse), the lawmen opened fire, killing Bonnie and Clyde while shooting a combined total of approximately 130 
rounds. Some have questioned whether there was any legal authority to kill Parker. The 

United States Congress
 awarded Hamer a special citation for trapping and killing the outlaws.28





Badges and uniforms






Texas Ranger badge, circa 1910 20



Modern-day Rangers (as well as their predecessors) do not have a prescribed uniform, per se, although the State of Texas does provide guidelines as to appropriate Ranger attire, including a requirement that Rangers wear clothing that is western in nature. Historically, according to pictorial evidence, Rangers wore whatever clothes they could afford or muster, which were usually worn out from heavy use.  While Rangers still pay for their clothing today, they receive an initial stipend to offset some of the costs of boots, gunbelts and hats.


To carry out their horseback missions, Rangers adapted tack and personal gear to fit their needs. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the greatest influence was from the 
vaqueros (Mexican cowboys). Saddles, spurs, ropes and vests used by the Rangers were all fashioned after those of the vaqueros. Most Rangers also preferred to wear broader-brimmed 
sombreros as opposed to 
cowboy hats, and they favored square-cut, knee-high boots with a high heel and pointed toes, in a more Spanish style. Both groups carried their guns the same way, with the 
holsters positioned high around their hips instead of low on the thigh, or in cross-draw holsters. This placement made it easier to draw and shoot while riding a horse.29


The wearing of badges became more common in the late 1800s. Historians have put forth several reasons for the lack of the regular use of a badge; among them, some Rangers felt that a shiny badge was a tempting target. Other historians have speculated that there was no real need to show a badge to a hostile Indian or outlaw. Additionally, from an historical viewpoint, a Ranger's pay was so scanty that the money required for such fancy accouterments was rarely available. Nevertheless, some Rangers did wear badges, and the first of these appeared around 1875. They were locally made and varied considerably from one to another, but they invariably represented a star cut out of a Mexican silver coin (usually a five-peso coin). The design is reminiscent of Texas's Lone Star flag.   


Although present-day Rangers wear the familiar  star in a wheel  badge, it was adopted officially only recently. The current design of the Rangers' badge was incorporated in 1962, when Ranger Hardy L. Purvis and his mother donated enough Mexican five-peso coins to the DPS to provide badges for all 62 Rangers who were working at that time as commissioned officers.30

Colin McPhee photo taken by 

Carl Van Vechten
, 1935




Colin McPhee (
February 15, 
1900, in 

Montreal
 or 

Toronto
   
January 7, 
1964, in 
Los Angeles) was a 

Canadian
 
composer and 
musicologist. He is primarily known for being the first Western composer to make an 
ethnomusicological study of 

Bali
, and for the quality of that work. He also composed music influenced by that of Bali and 
Java decades before such 
world music based compositions became widespread.



Chronology


McPhee studied with the avant-garde composer 
Edgard Varese before marrying Jane Belo, a disciple of 


Margaret Mead

, in 1931. He was involved in the circle of experimental composers known as the  ultra-modernists  and was among those along with the group's leader, 




Henry Cowell



, John Becker, and Cowell protege 
















Lou Harrison















 particularly interested in what would later become known as  world music.  McPhee is said to have first encountered 
Balinese music while listening to a record in New York City.1 He and his wife moved to Bali together for Belo's anthropological work. Once there McPhee became so interested in the local music that he studied, built, and wrote extensively about the 
gamelans. McPhee, who was 
gay,2 divorced Belo in 1939.  In the early 1940s he lived in a large brownstone in Brooklyn, which he shared with 

Leonard Bernstein
 and 

Benjamin Britten
, among others. McPhee was responsible for introducing Britten to the Balinese music that influenced such works by the British composer as The Prince of the Pagodas, 






Curlew River





, and 






Death in Venice





.3 Later in the decade, McPhee fell into an alcohol-fueled depression, but began to write music again during the 1950s. He became professor of ethnomusicology at UCLA in 1958 and was also a respected jazz critic.




Published works


McPhee's A House in Bali, the chronicle of his life there, is still considered a valuable introduction to Balinese culture. His posthumoustly published Music in Bali was the first comprehensive analysis of Balinese music published in English.


His best-known musical work is Tabuh-Tabuhan: Toccata for Orchestra, composed and premiered in Mexico in 1936. Its title translates as  collection of percussion instruments,  and it combines Balinese and traditional Western musical elements. It is scored for Western orchestra, but, in McPhee's description, the core of the ensemble is a  'nuclear gamelan' composed of two pianos, 
celesta, xylophone, 
marimba, and 
glockenspiel,  giving it a highly percussive balance of sound. The orchestra is augmented by two Balinese gongs and cymbals. The work is in three movements:  Ostinatos,  a flute-inspired  Nocturne,  and a syncopated  Finale.  Some of the themes in it derive from Balinese folk sources.

Record labels established in 1977




Fast Product was an 
independent record label, established in 
Edinburgh, Scotland by Bob Last in December 
1977. Its first release was also the first single by 
the Mekons, released on January 20, 1978.

The label is probably most notable for having issued the first records by a number of early and influential 
post-punk bands from 


Northern England

, including the original 
Human League, 


the Gang of Four

 and 
the Mekons.  Fast Product also released the first singles by the Scottish punk bands 


Scars

 and Flowers.  The label also released compilations of various new bands called 'ear comics' or Earcom.  Many of the label's releases were also produced by Bob Last. 


Fast Product's releases challenged 
pop music conventions (hence the label's early monikers:  difficult fun  and  mutant pop ), and through its releases and marketing  invoked a 
DIY punk spirit and generally 
socialist political outlook. Often packaging records with a caustic yet subtle sideswipe at 
consumerism (for example, the image of a wall of 
gold discs on the cover of the Mekons' first single), Fast Product attempted to show that all aspects of the record business, from musicianship to design to distribution, could be taken out of the hands of the major labels. 


The label was name-checked by 
the Clash in a lyric from the song,  

Hitsville UK
 , the band's homage to UK 
indies:   When lightening hits

Bob Last also established the Pop Aural label, releasing singles by such acts as Flowers,

 and

.

Networking hardware





A wireless gateway is a 
computer networking device that routes packets from a 
wireless LAN to another network, typically a wired 
WAN.  Wireless gateways combine the functions of a 
wireless access point, a 
router, and often provide 
firewall functions as well; thus they are 
converged devices.

Nervous system






 Somatic  redirects here; for the musician known as Somatic, see 















Hahn Rowe














.


The somatic nervous system is the part of the 
peripheral nervous system associated with the 
voluntary control of body movements through the action of 
skeletal muscles, and with 
reception of external 
stimuli, which helps keep the body in touch with its surroundings (e.g., 
touch, 
hearing, and 
sight).

The system includes all the 
neurons connected with 
muscles, 
skin and 
sense organs.  The somatic nervous system consists of 
efferent nerves responsible for sending brain signals for 
muscle contraction.



Nerve signal transmission



The somatic nervous system processes sensory information and controls all 
voluntary muscular systems within the body, with the exception of 
reflex arcs.


The basic route of 
nerve signals within the 
efferent somatic nervous system involves a sequence that begins in the upper 
cell bodies of 
motor neurons (
upper motor neurons) within the 

precentral gyrus
 (which approximates the 
primary motor cortex).  Stimuli from the precentral gyrus are transmitted from upper motor neurons and down the 
corticospinal tract, via 
axons to control skeletal (voluntary) muscles.  These stimuli are conveyed from upper motor neurons through the 
ventral horn of the 
spinal cord, and across 
synapses to be received by the 
sensory receptors of 
alpha motor neuron (large 
lower motor neurons) of the 
brainstem and 
spinal cord.


Upper motor neurons release a 
neurotransmitter, 
acetylcholine, from their axon terminal knobs, which are received by 
nicotinic receptors of the alpha motor neurons.  In turn, alpha motor neurons relay the 
stimuli received down their axons via the 
ventral root of the spinal cord.  These signals then proceed to the 
neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscles.  


From there, acetylcholine is released from the axon terminal knobs of alpha motor neurons and received by postsynaptic 
receptors (
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) of muscles, thereby relaying the stimulus to contract muscle fibers.




Vertebrate and invertebrate differences



In 
invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could either be excitatory or inhibitory.  For 
vertebrates, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter (always 
acetylcholine (ACh)) can only be excitatory or, in other words, contractile.




Reflex arcs



A 
reflex arc is an automatic reaction that allows an organism to protect itself 
reflexively when an imminent danger is perceived.  In response to certain stimuli, such as touching a hot surface, these reflexes are 'hard wired' through the spinal cord.  A reflexive impulse travels up afferent nerves, through a spinal 
interneuron, and back down appropriate efferent nerves.

Menntaskolinn i Reykjavik or MR is the oldest 





gymnasium




 (

Icelandic
: 
Menntaskoli) in 
Reykjavik, 



Iceland


.


The school traces its origin to 1056, when a school was established in 
Skalholt, and it remains one of the oldest institutions in Iceland. The school was moved to Reykjavik in 1786, but poor housing conditions forced it to move again in 1805 to 
Bessastadir near Reykjavik. In 1846 the school was moved to its current location, and a new building was erected for it in Reykjavik. This was the largest building in the country at the time and can be seen on the 500 
Icelandic krona bill. It was used initially when 
AlTingi began to meet again in Reykjavik after a few years hiatus and thus it is in this building where Icelandic independence leader 
Jon Sigurdsson led the MPs in their famous phrase, '
Ver motmalum allir'. 


The school had previously been known as  Lardiskolinn  (The Learned School),  Latinuskolinn  (The Latin School) or by the 

Latin
 title  Scholae Reykjavicensis , but received its present name in 1937.


Menntaskolinn i Reykjavik offers a four-year course of study. It usually ends with a degree (studentsprof) which gives the graduating student the right to advance to an 
Icelandic university.




Many Icelandic politicians, including former 








Prime Minister







 
David Oddsson and the current 

President of Iceland
, 
Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, attended MR.  Almost every Prime Minister of Iceland has been educated at the school apart from 
Halldor Asgrimsson, 
Olafur Johannesson and 
porsteinn Palsson. 

Geir H. Haarde
, David's successor as chairman of the 
Independence Party and the current Prime Minister, also took over from him as chairman of the student body ( 
inspector scholae ). The current President of Iceland, 
Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, was also the president of the other student body, the 
Framtidin.


Some notable Icelandic authors have also attended MR, amongst them 
Tomas Gudmundsson, 
Gudmundur G. Hagalin, and 
David Stefansson.  
Halldor Kiljan Laxness, a 
Nobel-prize winning author, also attended the school for some time but dropped out.  Another attendee, 

Niels Ryberg Finsen
 won the 

Nobel Prize
 in medicine.


Noted Icelandic scholar 
Sveinbjorn Egilsson served as the first 
rector of the school from its founding in Reykjavik in 1846.



Culture and traditions


Due to the high age and long history of the school, many traditions have evolved between the students. For example: The hall fight and singing of the Brevitate Vitae.



The Hall Fight


Every year at the end of spring semester the students of MR organize a fight in the halls of the main building. A bell is placed on the ground floor of the building and the seniors aim to reach that bell and ring it while other students try to fight them and prevent them from doing so. Should the seniors succeed their task, the younger students are to attend next class. During the fight, some or all senior students are covered in dirt.




The Freshmen Day


One day in the first weeks of school is a special day for newcomers (Icelandic: busadagur). The day starts with the seniors dressing up in white 
toga cloaks and painting their faces. The seniors then march around the school and gather the newcomers out to the school grounds where they are then thrown high into the air. The tradition of throwing newcomers into the air is old - but the part of dressing up in toga was added by seniors in 1991 (graduating in 1992). On this day (and the next few days after) students tend to sing the song  
De Brevitate Vitae.  The following night a freshmen ball is held.




The Fiddle Dance (Fidluballid)


The fiddle dance is by many described as a fancy promenade ball where live fiddle music is played and students wear their best garments while dancing elegantly.


The tradition was started in the 60's and was meant to be an iconoclasm to the hippie culture at the time. 
Reverend Geir Waage is rumored to have been the originator of the dance. It was only held once.


In 1992 it was resurrected by 








Dagur B. Eggertsson







, inspector scholae . It is now an annual event.




Published writings


The two student bodies maintain a number of periodic publications. Amongst them are: 



 The School Paper - Articles about the past year; published once a year. 


 
Loki Laufeyjarson - A newspaper about daily life and events in the school; published roughly once every month.


 
Skinfaxi - Similar to the school paper but with different writers and editors.


 
De Rerum Natura - A scientific magazine published by the science club every year.


 Yggdrasill   The Novelist News - Two magazines published by the Novelist club every year.


 Menntaskolatidindi - A bi-monthly newspaper.






Debating


The students of MR regularly hold debating competitions. These competitions are held very often and a lot of traditions have evolved around them.  Framtidin  is a debating society for MR students and it is also one of the oldest clubs in Iceland (founded in 1883). Solbjartur is an annual debating competition in which each class of MR is free to send one or more teams to debate. The winning team receives the title  Solbjartur  (Literally: Sun-bright) and the best debater of the winning team receives the title  Orator Scholae  (Latin: Spokesman of the school). Another annual competition is held, called  Orator Minor  (Latin: The next-best spokesman). Orator Minor is a competition where people debate about randomly selected subjects in one-on-one battles and only have ten minutes to prepare their speeches. However, Orator Minor, from the year 2007, is held more than once every year, even up to five times.




Quizzing


MR is greatly renowned for its excellent results in 

Gettu betur
, an annual quiz show for gymnasiums on the Icelandic national television. MR has won the quiz show 14 times out of 23, including an eleven-times winning streak 1993-2003. MR is the current holder of the trophy 
Hljodneminn (2008). An annual quiz competition is held, for which each class sends in one or more teams to compete against others. This competition is called  
Ratatoskur , named after the famous squirrel from Nordic mythology.





Housing


The number of students has grown rapidly since the founding of the school. This has led to the expanding of the school's housing. The flagship and main building of the school is still the front house, which was built in 1846. Several houses and additions have been built since. These buildings include:



ITaka is the library and study hall of MR.  It was built in the year 1867 as a gift to Icelanders from 
Charles Kelsall, a wealthy English merchant. The ground floor is a quiet room in which students find peace and comfort to read and study (as well as dictionaries and such). The upper floor is a library and a historical archive.


Fjosid (The Cowshed) is a small wooden house with two classrooms east of the main building. It was originally used to store fire-fighting equipment and later used to house the rector's cows.


ITrottahollin (The Sports-Palace) is the oldest sports hall in Iceland and for a long time it was the biggest, although it is thought to be very small by today's standards.


pralakistan (The Slave Chest) is a very small building connected to the Gym. It currently contains modern weight-lifting equipment but historically has contained fairly antiquated weight-lifting equipment. 


Casa Christi (Latin: House of Christ) is an old house with several classrooms. It is relatively big compared to other houses in the area. This building was once used by the Reykjavik 
YMCA, thus the name  Casa Christi . It has been noted by the students and faculty as smelling distinctly of 
chlorine. The building is due for demolishing in near future for a new and better building to be constructed


Casa Nova (Latin: New House) is a relatively new house and the largest one in the complex. It has many classrooms and is also the center for the students' social gatherings. A comfort lounge and a cafeteria is located in the basement of the building.


Villa Nova (Latin: New Apartment) is the groundskeeper's shed and a storage room for the school. It also used to house the offices of the student bodies before Amtmannsstigur 2 was taken into service.


Elisabetarhus (Elizabeth's House) also known as  Minni Elisabetar  (Memoirs of Elizabeth) is the latest addition to the school's housing. It has several classrooms, including perfect classrooms for vocational scientific training. Known as Casa Subuculae before it was fully taken into service.


Amtmannsstigur 2 is the teachers' lounge. It also houses a few offices and serves as a meeting place for the student bodies.

Sialkot Government Website




.Sialkot (

Urdu
/

Punjabi
:        ), the capital of 

Sialkot District
, is a city situated in the north-east of the 





Punjab




 province in 

Pakistan
 at the feet of the snow-covered peaks of 




Kashmir



 near the 
Chenab river. Formerly, Sialkot has been the winter-capital of the State of 




Kashmir



. The city is about 125 km (78 mi) north-west of 

Lahore
 and only a few kilometres from 
Jammu in 

India
.  , 



History


There are various sources tracing the origins of the city of Sialkot but the authenticity of many of these sources varies. The less-reliable historical sources about the origins of the city have been derived from oral traditions based on ancient local beliefs which, most historians concur, are full of inaccuracies, concocted legends and erroneous facts. These are, nonetheless, stated here. More reliable and validated historical references relating to the city date back to 327 BCE in which it has been stated that the city is of 

Persian
 and/or 

Greek
 origin. Excavations throughout the area have revealed large amounts of 






Greek coins





, ancient 
Zoroastrian temples and several 
Buddhist stupas. The antiquities of Sialkot have also been discussed by Sir 







Alexander Cunningham






 in his Archaeological Survey Reports, II, 21, 22, and XIV, 44 to 47. 


Vedic Era


Some of the more unreliable references to Sialkot are mentioned in ancient scriptures and oral traditions, these state that Sialkot is believed to have been founded by Raja Sul or (


Shalya

), emperor of Madradesa and brother of 


Madri

, second wife of emperor 


Pandu

 and mother to 
Nakul and 


Sahadeva

. He was the uncle of the 


Pandava

s, whose heroic deeds are recorded in the epic 
Mahabharta. After his death, some 5000 years ago, there is a tradition that the dynasty continued for some 1500 years. The seasonal stream, known as the Aik Nala, that still flows through the city, has been mentioned in the 
Upanishads. In the late 
Vedic period (c. 1500 - c. 200 B.C.E.), Sakala (Sialkot) was the capital of the 


Madra

s (
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad). Sakaladvipa (island of Sakala) was the name of the doab (land lying between two rivers) between Chandrabhaga (Chenab) and Iravati (Ravi). In those early days, Sakala was studded with thick forests and inhabited by a pastoral race called Yahars or Yirs.


Persian-Greek Era


According to the 
Greek historical texts which bring mention of the city of Sialkot dating back to 327 BCE when the city was known as 





Sagala




, it represented the eastern-most outpost and expansion of the 
Hellenic Empire created by 


Alexander the Great

 which has been cross-correlated to ancient Greek maps of the era and several monuments found in the Sialkot 





district




. The Greek historians state that the city was one of the most productive silk regions of the 




Achaemenid Empire



. Neverlessness, the 





Punjab




 had earned a reputation as being one of the poorest 
satrapy (province) beside Gandhara of the then Persian Empire. Sakala or 





Sagala




 was the capital, or one of the capitals, of the 


Indo-Greek Kingdom

 which broke-away from the 


Greco-Bactrian Kingdom

 during the 

Euthydemid Dynasty
, and the residence of 

Menander I
 (Milinda) during his reign between 160 and 135 BCE. Shun and Dall were two of the most powerful tribes in Sialkot. Then the country was flooded and remained one vast uninhabited region for about 1000 years.



the 
Indo-Greek king, 

Menander
, ruled in Sialkot during the 2nd century 



Scythian-Hun Era


According to Punjabi folk-lore, the early history of Sialkot is closely interwoven with the traditions of Raja Salivahan, his son, Raja Rasalu, and his foe, Raja Hudi. A popular belief is that the city was re-founded by Raja Salivahan or 
Salban when it became a part of 




Kashmir



 under King Sama Dutt. Raja Salivahan built a fort (







Sialkot Fort






)and the city and gave the place its present name. He was of Sia caste (a 

Jat
 clan of 
Scythian origins), and it is believed that the word  Sialkot  means the 'fort of the Sia'. Legend also says that Raja Salivahan had two sons: Puran and Rasalu. Puran got punished by his father, Raja Salivahan, due the to actions of a wicked stepmother and thrown into a well, still the resort of pilgrims near Sialkot, called  Puran di Khui , (Puran's Well). A mohalla (town) in the city is also named  Puran Nagar . The other son of Raja Salivahan, Rasalu, became Raja after the death of Raja Salivahan. Attacks from the neighbouring Raja of 
Jehlum ruined the city. Raja Rasalu got involved in wars with Raja Hudi, popularly stated to have been a 
Gakkhar chieftain. Being worsted in battle, Rasalu, as the price for peace, was forced to give his daughter in marriage to his conqueror, who gave the territory he had conquered to Rasalu's adopted son. After Rasalu s death in 400 AD, there are no significant accounts of Sialkot for the next 300 years in the known history except that, after the invasion of the 
Hunas (


Huns

 or 
Hephthalites) in the last quarter of the 5th century AD, it became the capital of 
Toramana and his son 




Mihirakula



 until he was defeated by a native Indian Prince, 









Yasodharman








.

Muslim-Mughal Era


Sialkot became a part of the 
Muslim 
Sultanate of Delhi when 











Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Ghauri










 conquered 


Punjab

 in 1185. He was unable to conquer 

Lahore
 but left a garrison in Sialkot. Later, Sultan Khusro Malik tried to capture the city but failed to do so. Sialkot then became a part of the 
Muslim 







Mughal Empire






. The Mughal commander, Usman Ghani Raza, advanced towards Delhi by way of Sialkot which capitulated to his armies. During the era of the Mughal Emperor, 
Jalal-ud-Din Muhammad Akbar, the present district of Sialkot formed a part of the Rachna-Bar Sarkar of the Lahore province. 
Baber also attacked Sialkot. In the Babur Nama, Babur records 



 

 '(29th December) We dismounted at Sialkot . If one goes into Hindustan , the 
Jats and 
Gujars always pour down in countless hordes from hill and plain for loot in bullock and buffalo . These ill-omened peoples are sensless oppressors ! Previously their deeds did notconcern us because the territory was an enemy's. But they did the same sensless deeds after we had captured it . When we reached Sialkot , they swooped on the poor and needy folk who were coming out of the town to our camp , and stripped them bare . I had thye witless brigands apprehended , and ordered a few of them to be cut to pieces  .1

 



Under the reign of the Mughal Emperor, 

Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Shah Jahan
, Ali Mardan Khan held the charge of Sialkot.


Afghan-Pashtun Era
At the end of the 







Mughal






 dynasty, the suburbs and the outlying districts and areas of Sialkot were left to themselves. Sialkot itself was appropriated by a powerful family of 
Pashtuns from 



Multan


 and 
Swat, the 




Kakazai



 and another family from 












Quetta











, and the sub-mountainous tracts were in the hands of Raja Ranjit Deo of 
Jammu. In 1748, the four districts of 
Gujrat, Sialkot, 








Pasrur







 and 








Daska







 were given to the Pashtun ruler, 
Ahmed Shah Durrani and the area was amalgamated into the Perso-Afghan empire. After 1751, Ahmed Shah Durrani left his son, Taimur, to rule Lahore and these districts. During that time, Raja Ranjit Deo of 
Jammu expanded his domination over the peripheral areas, but the city of Sialkot was not included in it. Afterwards, the city was held strongly by a 
Pashtun clans till the occupation of the 

Sikh
s who ruled for a period of about 40 years followed by the British. The Pashtun presence is still considerable to this day and continues to attract newer Pashtun migrants and workers from Pakistan's tribal areas.


Sikh-British Era



During the decline of the Durrani regime, Sialkot was occupied from the 
Pashtuns by the 

Sikh
s and thus began the rise of their short lived empire. Between 1797 to 1810, Maharaja 











Ranjit Singh










 occupied the Sialkot district. The 
Sikh Empire extended from Peshawer in the west, to Kashmir in the north (touching) the borders of Tibet, to the Indus River in the south near 



Multan


 and in the east to modern-day Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Ranjit Singh and his Sikh generals were capable of conquering such a great expanse of land for many reasons, varying from their European trained army, Sikh discipline, their modern European weaponry, modern British maps and the presence of ex-European mercernaries in his forces. After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the British officers were appointed in Sialkot. Sialkot was annexed by the 

British
 after the 








Second Anglo-Sikh War







 in 1849. The British laid the foundation of the Sialkot Cantonment in 1849 which was completed in 1852. For establishing the Sialkot Cantonment, the British Commander-in-Chief, 
Sir Lord Napier, surveyed and selected the area between the seasonal streams, Bher Nala and Palkhu Nala, from the point of view of defence. The Area Command laid its foundation in 1852 under the leadership of Major-General Angulas. During the 

Indian Rebellion of 1857
 it was the scene of heavy fighting, and the 







Sialkot Fort






 was used by the Europeans for protection. The native troops plundered the 
treasury and destroyed all the records.


Murray College
, Sialkot was established in 1889. The railway branch from 








Wazirabad







 to Sialkot was extended to 
Jammu in 1890. The Sialkot-Narowal railway line was opened in 1915.


Pakistan Movement Era


The city played an important role during the 
Pakistan Movement. The national poet of Pakistan who spearheaded the movement for an independent country, 
Dr. Muhammad Iqbal was born in Sialkot in 1877. In May 1944, the historic Sialkot Convention was held here. This convention is widely regarded as the landmark event which catapulted the 
All India Muslim League into prominence in the British-Indian 

Punjab
. This convention was host to such 
Muslim League luminaries as 


Muhammad Ali Jinnah

, 

Liaquat Ali Khan
, 





Chaudhry Naseer Ahmad Malhi




, 

Khawaja Nazim-ud-Din
, 









Sardar Abd-ur-Rab Nishtar








, Mumtaz Ahmad Khan Daultana, Nawab Iftikhar Hussain Khan of Mamdot and Maulvi Tamiz-ud-Din.


Modern Era





 

Battle of Chawinda
 was the biggest tank battle since the 

Battle of Kursk
 in 







World War II










After the independence of 

Pakistan
 from British rule in 1947, thousands of 
Muslims from 

Pathankot
 and 



Gurdaspur


 and from other parts of 


East Punjab

 came to Sialkot as refugees and settled here. Earlier, the 
Muslim residents of 

Gurdaspur
 had believed that the entire district, with a slight Muslim majority, was to be allocated to 

Pakistan
. However, at the time of 
partition of India, the British, in a highly controversial decision, allocated the district to 

India
, allegedly to grant it access to the land route to the 
Princely State of 




Kashmir



. Most of these refugees have since settled and intermarried into the local population. The large Hindu and Sikh populations of Sialkot and the adjoining 

Shakargarh
 (then called Shankargarh) tehsil of 



Gurdaspur district


, which was allocated to Pakistan and later merged with Sialkot, migrated to 


East Punjab

. Ever since, Sialkot has gradually become one of the major industrial centres of Pakistan and is well-known for its manufacture and export of surgical instruments, musical instruments, sports goods, leather goods, textile products and other light manufactures. Its people have built on their tradition of being hard working, entrepreneurial and progressive.


During the 
Second Kashmir War in 1965, the Lahore-Sialkot region was attacked by the 
Indian Army which, despite overwhelming numerical superiority managed only to capture some outlying areas in the sector. The people of 



Sialkot


 came out in full force to support the troops of the Pakistan Army to repel the invasion by India.2 In fact, the armoured battles in the Sialkot sector (especially, the 

Battle of Chawinda
), in 1965, were the most intense since the Second World War.3 In 1966, the Government of Pakistan awarded the 
Hilal-i-Istaqlal to the citizens of Sialkot, Lahore and Sargodha for their courage and bravery during the 1965 war between Pakistan and India. 


Again, during the 






Indo-Pakistani War of 1971





, the region witnessed bitter battles, most importantly, the 

Battle of Basantar
 in the Sialkot-Shakar Garh area. The major Indian 
counter-offensive came in this area where, two Pakistani tank regiments, equipped with the obsolete Patton tanks, confronted the Indian First Armoured Corps, which was equipped with the then more modern British Centurion tanks. Again, the Pakistan Army and the people of Sialkot earned a mark for their valour in defending against such numerical odds.




Geography and Climate


Lying between 32 30  North latitude and 74 31  East longitude at an altitude of 256 m above sea level, Sialkot is bounded on the north  by 
Jammu, north-west by 
Gujrat, on the west by 
Gujranwala and on the south by

Sialkot  is cold during winters and hot and humid during summers. May and June are the hottest months. The temperature during winter may drop to 0 C. The land is, generally, plain and fertile. Most of the rain falls during the 
Monsoon season in summer which often results in flooding.

Deputy Administrator who is also 





Speaker




 of the District 
Council. The District 
Administrator is elected by the 
Administrators of the 
Union Councils and 
Union Councillors who, themselves, are elected directly by the votes of the local public. There are 106 
Union Councils in District Sialkot. The District

 Economy and Industry 





Football Industry


 


Surgical Instruments made in Sialkot



Sialkot is the third largest economic hub in 





Punjab




 after 

Lahore
 and 



Faisalabad


. It is commercially linked with the 






Lahore Stock Exchange





 through its Sialkot branch, known as the 






Sialkot Trading Floor





 (STF). The 

State Bank of Pakistan
 and the 
Export Promotion Bureau of Pakistan have branch offices in Sialkot. After 

Karachi
, Sialkot is Pakistan's second largest source of foreign exchange earnings through its exports and remittances from overseas manpower. For the past several decades, the manufacturers and exporters of the city have been  awarded the annual national Exports award by the 
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Sialkot has an Industrial Estate and an 
Export Processing Zone. Another 
Export Processing Zone is planned along the 





Sialkot Lahore Motorway




. The per capita Income of Sialkot is ranked among the highest in Pakistan. 

Honda
 Motors is planning to establish its second car manufacturing plant in Sialkot. The UAE-based multinational Coastal Group International will also invest US $1 billion to set up a 

Mercedes
 car manufacturing plant near Sambrial, Sialkot.


The history of industralization of Sialkot is very old. The Damascene craftsmen of Sialkot (koftgars or koftars) were famous during the 
Mughal era for their fine swords and daggers. Papermaking in Sialkot dates back to the time of the 







Mughal






 Emperor 
Akbar which was famous all over the world. Brick making was another historic skill of the people of the Sialkot and those bricks were known as the  Sialkoti Bricks  throughout India. Most of the states in India relied on the slender but strong Sialkoti bricks for the erection of forts, castles, monuments, public buildings, infrastructure construction, etc. 


Nowadays, Sialkot is famous all over the world because of its 
Sports Equipment and 
Surgical Instruments manufacturing industry. According to a myth, the sport goods industry got its start in Sialkot when a British man broke his tennis racquet and, since an immediate replacement was not possible, he asked a local craftsman to repair it. The man did a perfect job and the sports goods manufacturing industry took root in Sialkot. The recorded history of the industry goes back to 1895 when the city started becoming famous for its tennis racquets. By 1903, cricket bats were being crafted from imported English willow and exported to different parts of 


South Asia

 and beyond. In 1922, a local manufacturer was awarded the British Empire Export Award for supplying 
footballs to the British Army. Over the years the industry grew to include a variety of wood and leather-based sports equipment, and diversified into related industries such as 
cricket balls, 
volleyballs, 
field hockey sticks, 
polo sticks, recreational fishing equipment, sports apparel and horse riding equipment and even the Scottish bagpipes. The most successful sports manufacturing firms now have international collaborations with the well-known sports brands like 

Adidas
 (Germany), 

Puma
 (Germany), 

Nike
 (USA), 
Dita (UK), 



Mikasa


 (Japan)  and 

Slazenger
 (UK). In the recent past, however, lack of modernisation and allegations of child labour usage have resulted in a loss of 
market share to the new entrants in the business like Thailand, Korea and China. The Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry has now almost controlled the incidents of child labour usage within the industry with the collaboration of the 
United Nations (


ILO

). Most of the companies have adopted the ISO standards.


As with the industrial clusters elsewhere in the world, the birth of Sialkot s surgical industry can partly be explained by what 



Paul Krugman


, a U.S. economist' calls an  historic accident .  In 1905, some broken surgical equipment at the American Mission Hospital in Sialkot afforded a chance for Sialkot craftsmen to adopt their skills. Encouraged by the hospital staff, they gradually started manufacturing replicas of originals. Orders were received from other mission hospitals in British India. By 1920, Sialkot was exporting to all parts of the British empire including 

Afghanistan
 and 

Egypt
 and was later selected for supplying surgical instruments for the 
Allied forces in 







World War II






. The Metal Industries Development Centre (MIDC) was established in 1942 to act as a supply and inspection agency for the 
Allied forces. Although the surgical instruments manufacturing factories were mostly owned by Hindus, the craftsmen were mostly Muslim and the industry was not affected by the partition of British India. At present, the surgical instruments manufacturing industry in Sialkot is one of the world's largest surgical instruments manufacturing industrial clusters second only to 

Tuttlingen
, 

Germany
. However, the quality of workmanship and raw materials are the issues that have been hindering the progress of this niche industry which is also likely to face increasing pressures from the rapid advances in the field of surgery. During last three decades, manufacture and export of veterinary instruments has also emerged very prominently here.  


Other important industries in Sialkot include 
Leather Tanneries, 
Leather Garments, 
Musical Instruments, 
Sportswear included 
Martial arts  wear , 
Gloves, 
Badges, Seat and Walking Sticks, 
Cutlery, 





Hunting Knives




, 
Air Guns and 
Shotguns. These are all export-oriented businesses and fetch billions of dollars every year in 
foreign exchange. There are several other allied industries which are working day and night as vendors of the 
automobile industry of Pakistan. Sialkot has a rich tradition of producing wooden and steel furniture, 
rubber products, cooking utensils, 
bicycles, their tyres and tubes and shoes

Ioan Gruffudd




Ioan Gruffudd (pronounced , ;  ( 


info


); born 
6 October 
1973) is a 


Welsh

 
actor.

Educated at the 



Royal Academy of Dramatic Art


, he came to international attention as Fifth Officer 


Harold Lowe

 in the film 

Titanic
 (1997), and as Lt. John Beales in 

Black Hawk Down
 (2001). However, he is probably best known for playing the role of 














Horatio Hornblower













 in 

Hornblower
, the British made-for-TV films (1998 2003) based on 
C.S. Forester's novels. 


Gruffudd's recent notable film roles include 







Lancelot






 in 

King Arthur
 (2004), 


Mister Fantastic

 (Reed Richards) in 

Fantastic Four
 (2005) and the sequel  (2007), and British 
slavery 
abolitionist 


William Wilberforce

 in 

Amazing Grace
 (2006). 



Family, early life and education


Gruffudd was born on 
6 October 
1973 in the village of 





Llwydcoed




 near the town of 

Aberdare
, in the 

county borough
 of 



Rhondda Cynon Taff


, 



Mid Glamorgan


, south 
Wales. His family later moved to 

Cardiff
.1 Gruffudd's parents, Peter and Gillian Griffiths, were teachers.2 His father was headmaster at two Welsh comprehensive schools in South Wales, first at 



Ysgol Gyfun Llanhari


 then later at 



Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen


.3 He has two siblings; a brother, Alun,4 who is two years younger, and a sister, Siwan, who is seven years younger than he is.1


The popular Welsh name  
Ioan  is an equivalent of  
John , and  Gruffudd  corresponds to the 





Anglicized




  
Griffith . He has been quoted as saying,  I'm determined not to lose my name. It's who I am. It has neither aided my progress nor hampered it. It's just who I am. My character... my make-up. My culture and heritage is a very rich one. So what if it's difficult for people to pronounce? We all learned how to say 





Schwarzenegger




. 5


Gruffudd attended Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Aberdar (Ynyslwyd) (now situated in 





Cwmdare




), Ysgol Gymraeg Melin Gruffydd, and 

Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf
, where he sat his 

















GCSEs
















 and 










A-Levels









. A natural musician, he was an accomplished 
oboist in his teens,6 attaining a Grade 8 level in the 
ABRSM music examinations7 and playing for the South Glamorgan Youth Orchestra for several years,8 but gave it up once acting took up most of his time.9 He also won prizes for his high 
baritone singing while at school, including one at the 
National Eisteddfod.7 He has said,  As a Welshman, I grew up in a culture of singing and performing with music, and I think it was through this performing that I got my confidence as an actor. 10


Gruffudd's parents are committed

A E
. Gruffudd has said:  It was quite something for an unknown actor to get the lead. So I will always be grateful to Hornblower. ... I would love to play this character through every stage of his life. I think it would be unique to have an actor playing him from the very early days as a midshipman, through till he's an Admiral. So, I would love to play this character till he perishes. 10 Since 
February 20, 
2007, Gruffudd has been making plans to obtain rights to the Horatio Hornblower novels in order to produce a film for the big screen.14

Personal life


Gruffudd lives with his wife, American-born British actress 

Alice Evans
, in 

Los Angeles, California
. The couple met during the production of 102 Dalmatians, and married on 
14 September 
2007 in 








Mexico







.20 One of Gruffudd's 
best men and speechmakers at the wedding was fellow Welsh actor 

Matthew Rhys
, his long-time friend and former flatmate of eight years.4


Gruffudd enjoys being in Los Angeles because  it's the easiest place in the world to drive, and it's a real pleasure to do that in my black 

Jag XK8
. I've gone all out. 6 He also admires the physicality and confidence of Americans, and enjoys being around them because he feels these qualities rub off on to him.21


In April 2007, Gruffudd removed his funding from his largest fan-site, 
Ioanonline.com, due to comments made about Evans on the site, and elsewhere on the Internet, which angered her. In March 2007, Gruffudd posted a message on Ioanonline.com that started with  Dear All , and expressed disappointment about the  small minority  of fans that had behaved in a  despicable manner  by levelling  unpleasant and sometimes vitriolic comments  at his wife.22 Despite the attempts of the site's owner to broker a solution, Gruffudd ceased funding, which resulted in the website's closure on 
30 April 
2007.23

I was utterly aghast and in a state of shock when I discovered the unpleasant and sometimes vitriolic comments that were being leveled at my fiancee Alice when I recently observed the community forum on 'ioanonline'. I find it hard to believe that people who have supported me so ardently over the years would behave in such a despicable manner. I have never been happier since meeting and falling in love with Alice and I am overwhelmed with excitement about getting married to the woman of my dreams. I am aware that it is always a small minority that gives the majority a bad name. I wish to thank those of you who continually support everything I do in such a positive and passionate manner, and I implore the few of you that sullies the good name of the majority to put an end to this practice that has brought such heartache to me personally.

Autosomal recessive inheritance

autorecessive.jpg

277610




Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome is an 
autosomal recessive 
genetic disorder, linked to 
mutations (955 
gly - gt; 
glu) in the 






COL11A2





 
gene (located on 
chromosomal position 6p21.3), which codes for the  alpha;2 strand of 
collagen type XI. 12

It is a 
collagenopathy, types II and XI disorder.



Presentation


It causes facial abnormalities, skeletal malformation and occasionally 
neural tube defects; the skeletal disfigurements resolve to a degree in the course of development. 


Mutations in different parts of the gene may lead to 
deafness or 
Stickler syndrome type III (eye problems: 
myopia, 
retinal detachment and skeletal abnormalities). 




Eponym


It was first characterized in 1964 by G. Weissenbacher and Ernst Zweymuller.34

Diane Edith Watson (born 
November 12 
1933), 








American







 politician, has been a member of the 

United States House of Representatives
 since 2001, representing the 33rd District of 

California
 (
map). Her district is located entirely in 
Los Angeles County and includes much of Central Los Angeles, including some wealthy neighborhoods such as 
Los Feliz. She recently ran unopposed in the 2006 Congressional mid-term elections.



Life before Congress


Born in 

Los Angeles, California
, She was born and raised Catholic. 1 Watson was educated at 




Los Angeles City College



, then transferred to the 


University of California, Los Angeles

, receiving her 
BA from the school in 1956.  Sh earned an 
MS from 

California State University, Los Angeles
 in 1987 and a 
PhD from 

Claremont Graduate University
 the same year.  She also attended the 
Kennedy School of Government at 

Harvard University
. Watson was a practicing psychologist, a faculty member at 

California State University
, and a health occupation specialist with the Bureau of Industrial Education of the California Department of Education before entering politics. 


Watson was a member of the 

California State Senate
 from 1978 to 1998 and was the longtime champ of the Health and Human Services Committee, where she gained a reputation as an advocate for healthcare for the poor and children.  She was appointed United States 
Ambassador to 

Micronesia
 under 



Bill Clinton


 in 1999 before entering the House. Watson is a member of 

Alpha Kappa Alpha





Committee Assignments





Foreign Affairs Committee


Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health


Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Environment


Oversight and Government Reform Committee


Subcommittee on Domestic Policy


Chair of the Congressional Entertainment Industries Caucus


Co-chair of the Congressional Korea Caucus


Co-chair of the U.S.-UK Caucus






Views in Congress


Congresswoman Watson supports military withdrawal from Iraq 2, opposes media consolidation 3, supports expanding welfare coverage 4 and opposes President Bush's plans for 
Social Security5.


Watson has opposed tax cuts by saying that they are unaffordable.


She was one of the 31 members of the House who voted not to count the 
electoral votes from 





Ohio




 in the 

United States presidential election, 2004
. 6


In 2006, the National Journal ranked Watson as the most liberal member of Congress.7


On the issue of Cherokee Freedmen membership in the Cherokee tribe, Watson notes that 20,000 Cherokee live in California.  She opposed the Cherokee Nation's March 2007 vote to amend its constitution to limit membership to only those descendants with at least one Indian ancestor on the Dawes Roll.  She notes that freedmen were granted citizenship in 1866 by a treaty which the tribe made with the US government, without restriction to those freedmen with Indian ancestry.  Appeals to the Cherokee Nation's position were pending, in part because they excluded descendants of Cherokee freedmen and intermarried whites from voting on the amendment.  She introduced a bill in June 2007 to sever US relations with the tribe and gaming privileges unless they granted descendants of Cherokee freedmen membership in the tribe.8
She stated in an interview on NPR that part of the reason she was doing this is because  I am a daughter of Pocahontas, but not the Pocahontas (word missing?) of Cherokee. 9



Support of Clinton over Obama


While Watson's district went overwhelmingly for Illinois Senator 


Barack Obama

 by a margin of 61-29 over New York Senator and former First Lady 


Hillary Rodham Clinton

 on the 
February 5, 
2008 Democratic Presidential Primaries, Watson, as a 
superdelegate, continued to support Clinton. 


Watson won against her challengers in the California June 3 primary and will face Republican David Crowley in the November 4 General Election.

Edward Drinker Cope


Philadelphia, Pennsylvania


Paleontology, 
zoology, 
herpetology




Edward Drinker Cope (July 28, 1840 April 12, 1897) was an 








American







 
paleontologist and 
comparative anatomist, as well as a noted 
herpetologist and 
ichthyologist.

Born to a wealthy Quaker family, Cope quickly distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science; he published his first scientific paper in 1859. Cope married his cousin and had several children, moving closer to the marl pits of Haddonfield New Jersey to be near fossil finds.


Cope is best known for his highly publicized 
Bone Wars with 
O. C. Marsh. A race to publish their findings, and thus prioritize their discoveries, consumed both Marsh s and Copes finances and lives. Cope traveled the American West searching for fossils.  His staunch resolve in his belief of 
Neo-Lamarckism was the subject of ridicule by of many of his peers at the 



American Philosophical Society


 and by his greatest enemy, O.C. Marsh. 


Along with his rival, Cope helped define the field of American paleontology. Cope's writing was prodigious, with a record 1,200 papers published over his lifetime. He named dozens of species of dinosaurs, and in total named more than 1,000 vertebrate species. His most established theories on the origin of mammalian 
molars and the 
Cope s Law on the gradual enlargement of mammalian species are considered his best generalized theories.



Biography



Early life


Edward Drinker Cope was born on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope.1 The death of his mother at the age of three seemed to have little effect on him, as he mentioned in his letters that he had no recollection of her. His stepmother Rebecca Biddle filled the motherly role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. His father was a philanthropist and gave money to the Advancement of Colored People, the 
Society of Friends, the education of Native Americans and the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens.


Edward was born and raised in a large stone house in present-day suburban 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania called  Fairfield .1 The eight acres of pristine and exotic gardens of the house offered a natural landscape that Edward was able to explore.2 The Copes began teaching their children to read and write at a very young age, and took Edward on trips across New England and to museums, zoos, and gardens. Cope's interest in animals became apparent at a young age, as did his natural artistic ability.3


Alfred intended to give his son the same education that he himself was brought up in. At nine, Edward was sent to a day school in Philadelphia and in 1853 at the age of twelve, Edward was sent to the 
Friends  Boarding School, near West Chester, Pennsylvania.4  The school was founded in 1799 with fundraising by members of the Society of Friends (Quakers), as was the site of much of the Cope family's education.5 The prestigious school was expensive, costing Alfred $500 tuition each year, and in his first year Edward studied Algebra, Chemistry, Scripture, Physiology, Grammar, Astronomy, and Latin.6 Edward's letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to manipulate his father, and that he was, according to author Jane Davidson,  a bit of a spoiled brat .7


Despite complaints about his schooling, Cope returned to Westtown in 1855, accompanied by two of his sisters. Biology began to interest him more, and he studied natural history texts in his spare time. While at the prestigious school Cope frequently visited the 


Academy of Natural Sciences

.  Cope frequently obtained bad marks for quarrelsome and bad conduct, and his letters to his father show that he chafed at farm work and betrayed flashes of the temper he would later become well known for.8 After sending Edward back to the farm for summer break in 1854 and 1855, Alfred did not return Edward to school after spring 1856. Instead Alfred attempted to turn his son into a gentleman farmer, a wholesome profession that would yield enough profit to lead a comfortable life. In his letters to his father, during this period till 1863, Edward continually yearned for more of a professional scientific career than that of a farmer, which he called,  dreadfully boring. 9  His father went so far as to actually buy Edward a 200-acre (0.81 km2) farm in 1860.


While working on farms, Edward continued his education. In 1858 he began working at the Academy of Natural Sciences part-time, reclassifying and cataloguing specimens, and published his first series of research results in January 1859. Cope also began taking French and German classes with a former Westtown teacher.10 Though Alfred resisted his son's acceptance of a science career, he also paid for his son's private studies.


Alfred finally gave into Edward s strong intellectual capabilities and paid for classes. Cope attended the 

University of Pennsylvania
 in the 1861 and/or 1862 academic years,11 studying comparative anatomy under 

Joseph Leidy
, one of the most influential anatomists and paleontologists at the time.12  Cope also asked his father to pay for a tutor in both German and French,  not so much for their own sake,  wrote Edward,  but as for their value in enabling me to read their books of a literary or scientific character. 13  He also had a job during this period recataloging the herpetological collection at the 


Academy of Natural Sciences

, in which he became a member at Leidy's urging.14 Edward's job lasted two years and he visited the 
Smithsonian Institute on occasion while working. At the Smithsonian he became acquainted 
Spencer Baird, who was an expert in the field of 
ornithology and ichthyology.15




 European travels 



In 1863-1864, Edward traveled through Europe, taking the opportunity to visit all the most esteemed museums and societies of the time. His sudden departure for Europe prevented him from being drafted into the 

American Civil War
; Edward was more concerned with helping the newly emancipated blacks in the south than the North s need for his services in a hospital.16 Another reason for the sudden departure was the failure of a love affair that deeply affected Edward, although 

Henry Fairfield Osborn
 s biography barely mentions it. Edward's journals and letters from the time period do not exist, for he burned them upon his return from his European travels. Cope did write to his father from London on Feb. 11, 1864 that,  I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this, as I know certain persons who would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe to avoid the war. 17  The letters that his family kept from Edward show a deeply depressed man from his failed love affair. He attempted to  keep my resolution of occupying  my mind constantly as to crowd out painful thoughts ..it is perhaps a great advantage that I have had the outside of my sensibilities scorched into a crust. 18  


Despite his torpor, Edward proceeded with his tour of Europe, and met with some of the most highly esteemed scientists of the world during his travels through France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Austria, Italy, and Eastern Europe, most likely with introductory letters from Joseph Leidy and 
Spencer Baird.19 In the winter of 1863, Edward met 

Othniel Charles Marsh
 while in 
Berlin, Germany. Marsh, aged thirty-two, was attending the 
University of Berlin. Though Marsh had two university degrees in comparison to Edward's lack of formal schooling past sixteen, Edward at the age of twenty-three had published 37 scientific papers in comparison to Marsh's two published works.20 The two men appeared to take a liking to each other; Marsh led Edward on a tour of the city, and they stayed together for several days. After Edward left Berlin the two maintained a correspondence, exchanging manuscripts, fossils, and photographs.20




Early career


Upon returning to Philadelphia in 1864 the Cope family made every effort to secure Edward a teaching post as the Professor of Zoology at 

Haverford College
, a small Quaker school that the family had ties to philanthropically.21 The college awarded him an honorary master s degree so he could have the position. Cope even began to think about marriage and consulted his father in the matter, telling him of the girl he would like to marry,  an amiable woman, not over sensitive, with considerable energy, and especially one inclined to be serious and not inclined to frivolity and display- the more Christian of course the better- seems to be the most practically the most suitable for me, though intellect and accomplishments have more charm. 21 Cope thought of Annie Pim, a member of the Society of Friends, as less a lover and was more inclined towards,  her amiability and domestic qualities generally, her capability of taking care of a house, etc., as well as her steady seriousness weigh far more with me than any of the traits which form the theme of poets! 22 In July 1865 at Mary Pim s hillside house in Chester County Pennsylvania, Edward married Annie Pim. On June 10, 1866 the union would be blessed with Edward s only child, Julia Biddle Cope.


Cope s personal life may have been progressing nicely but his professional one was not. Cope found enriching the minds of students at Haverford  a pleasure,  but  could not get any work done. 2324 Pleading with his father for money to pursue his career, he finally sold the farm in 1869 that his father had bought him.25  He resigned from his position at Haverford and moved his family to Haddonfield, in part to be closer to the fossil beds of western New Jersey.26




1870s





Cope's Pine Street residence



Upon the selling of his farm, moving to 
Haddonfield, and resigning from his position at Haverford, it was decided between Alfred Cope and his son that Edward would become a scientist. He began his professional fossil hunting career in the New Jersey marl pits, where he would find the carnivorous Laelaps, his first large nearly dinosaur skeleton, as well as many smaller dinosaurs, mammoths and other vertebrates of the Cretaceous era.27  His first synopsis at the Philadelphia Academy was on the extinct amphibia of the world and would begin his trips to the west in 1871.28  His first trip to Western Kansas amazed Cope. Here was an area in which complete skeletons could be found in the soft sand that was once the sea shore. In subsequent years Cope would journey to Wyoming and Colorado under the direction of the 
Hayden Survey, in which he discovered 96 new species. 


In 1874 Cope was employed with the 
Wheeler Survey to New Mexico, whose Puerco formations, he wrote to his father, provided  the most important find in geology I have ever made. 29  The New Mexico bluffs contained millions of years of formation and subsequent deformation. It was an area which had not been visited by either Leidy or Marsh. By being employed in government surveys it helped Cope by being able to draw on Fort commissaries and defraying the costs of publishing. His findings would instead be published in the annual reports that the surveys printed, but there was no actual salary involved. Cope did bring Annie and Julia along on the Hayden survey and rented a house for them at Fort Bridger, but he inherently spent more of his own money on these survey trips than he would have liked.30   However, the severe desert conditions and Cope s habit of overworking himself till he was bedridden caught up with him and in 1872 he broke down from over exhaustion. 31 The 







Agathaumas






 sylvestris, or  marvelous saurian of the forest, 32  was the crown jewel of this period and was discovered by one of Cope s collectors, F. B. Meek. He tried to be the first to publish on this dinosaur, knowing that it was something entirely new. So Cope telegrammed the message to the 



American Philosophical Society


, but the telegrapher jumbled the name. This mistake gave Marsh precedence on the naming of the dinosaur he named, 
Triceratops, which became a household name. 


In 1875 Alfred Cope died and left Edward with an inheritance of nearly a quarter of a million dollars. His father s death was a blow to Edward, who had always confided in him. In the same year he also published the massive volume, Vertebrata of the Cretaceous Formations of the West, nicknamed Cope s Bible.  Cope now had the finances to hire multiple teams to search for fossils for him year round and in 1876 he advised the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition on their fossil displays.  In 1877 Cope purchased half the rights to the 

American Naturalist
 in order to have an avenue in which to publish the many papers he was churning out at a rate so high that Marsh questioned their dating.33  In 1878 he went back to Europe for the second time and was treated as a celebrity, giving lectures to museums and scientific societies across the continent. He bought a large selection of fossils that had been unearthed in Argentina and were sold to the American Museum of Natural history in 1899 where they became known as the  Cope Pampean  collection. 34 


The 1870 s were the golden years of Cope s career, where his most prominent discoveries and when his most rapid flow of publications occurred. In the period of one year from 1879-1880 he published 76 papers when he was traveling through New Mexico and Colorado, and from the findings of his collectors in Texas, Kansas Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah.35  His greatest anatomical generalization was published in 1879, his principle on the tritubercular origin of the molar teeth of the mammals. Henry Osborn would in 1907 elaborate further on this theory. This prodigious output was spurred in part by competition from his old Berlin acquaintance, Othniel Marsh.




Bone Wars





Main article: 
Bone Wars

Cope's relations with Marsh led to a competition for bones between the two, known today as 
The Bone Wars, which lasted from about 1877 to 1892. The conflict began upon the men's return to the U.S. they wrote letters to each other and when Cope moved to his Haddonfield home, they visited the New Jersey marl pits together. Cope introduced Marsh to the owner of the pits, Albert Vorhees. This was the start of many problems the two would have over their careers. Marsh would go behind Cope s back and privately arrange for all the fossils that Vorhees s men found to be sent back to Marsh at New Haven.36   


In 1870 the two men had a falling out of sorts. Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope s fossil finds, the 




Elasmosaurus



, which was a complete skeleton of a large aquatic 
plesiosaur that had four flippers and a long neck. Marsh commented that the fossil s head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull at the end of the vertebra of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until the two agreed to have Joseph Leidy come examine the bones and see who was right. Leidy came and simply picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil that had the error in it at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back all the copies, but some remained floating around (Marsh kept his as did Leidy).37  The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover up at the next society meeting, not to in any way alienate Cope but only in response to Cope s brief retracted statement where he never admitted he was wrong. A few weeks later Cope paid a visit to the marl pits and found that men in Marsh s employment were busy collecting in an area that Cope had thought his own. The two would never talk to each other amicably again.



Cope funded Lucas' discoveries, including the bones 
Camarasaurus supremus, pictured.





Cope was described by all as a genius and what Marsh lacked in intelligence, he easily made up for in connections. Marsh s uncle was George Peabody, a rich banker who founded the Peabody Museum at Yale. He supported Marsh with money, as well as a secure position at the Peabody museum. His uncle s money allowed Marsh to pay off anyone, while the political connections, as high as Ulysses S. Grant. Marsh urged John Wesley Powell to request fossils Cope had collected during government surveys and attempted to persuade 
Ferdinand Hayden, to  muzzle  Cope s publishing.38   Both men tried their hardest to spy on the other s whereabouts and attempted to offer their collectors more money in the hopes of recruiting them to their own side. Cope was able to recruit David Baldwin in New Mexico and Frank Williston in Wyoming from Marsh.39  They were both extremely secretive as to where there fossils were coming from and when Henry Osborn, at the time a student at Princeton, visited Cope to ask where he and some of his classmates should travel to look for fossils in the West, Cope politely denied them access to the knowledge of where the fossil fields were in Kansas. 40 


When Cope arrived back in the United States after his tour of Europe in 1878, he had nearly two years of fossil findings from O.W. Lucas, a man digging for him in the Morrison Formation of Jurassic sandstone outside Canon City, Colorado. Among these dinosaurs would be the 







Camarasaurus






, a dinosaur that today is one of the most recognizable recreations of this time period.41   The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco and north to Oregon, where he was amazed at the rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean.42  In 1879 the United States congress consolidated the survey team into one, U.S. Geological Survey with 








Clarence King







 as its leader. This was discouraging because King immediately named his old college buddy and intimate friend, O.C. Marsh, as the chief paleontologist. Cope s intimate and cordial relationship with his own fossil collectors insured that they stayed loyal to him, no matter how much Marsh offered them to come to his service. 
Charles Sternberg, J.L. Wortman and David Baldwin were especially prolific, securing some of the finest fossils of the time. 




Later years


For 25 years the two greatest paleontologist of their time did not speak to each other and attempted at every turn to discredit each other s discoveries. Marsh continuously complained of Cope s rapid publishing pace and accused him of altering dates. Cope in turn accused Marsh of antedating his papers in order to get priority over contested discoveries. The ordeal became public to all those outside of the scientific community when, in response to Marsh s influence in having Powell pull Cope off of the government survey team, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Cope over the years had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had it all written down in a journal that he had kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. 43 William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell and Cope.44  Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government allocated funds.45  Marsh and Powell were each able to publish their own side of the story and in the end little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate the misallocation of funds by Powell and neither Cope nor Marsh was held responsible for any of their mistakes. Marsh was however quickly removed from his position as paleontologist for the government surveys, Cope s relations with the president of the University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.46 


Cope took the whole debacle in stride. In writing to Osborn about the articles he laughed at the outcome, telling Osborn,  It will now rest largely with you whether or not I am supposed to be a liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerus. 47  Both men ended their lives as two of the greatest paleontologists of the time period. They both died in relative obscurity and both spent their sizable inheritances in search of the fossils of the west. Cope was seen as the more intelligent but reckless of the two, while Marsh was better connected politically and more methodical with his work. As a final challenge, Cope dictated that his brain was to be taken out and weighed against Marsh s brain, to see whose was heavier upon their deaths. Marsh however did not rise to the challenge. Cope was well aware of all of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after his many enemies. The new species was a combination of two words: Cope and hater. This new species was called Anisonchus cophater. 48


Cope's search for mineral wealth from 1881-1889 took a disastrous toll on his finances, and in 1887 he had to sell whatever his stocks were still of worth among the various mining operations in which  he had invested. His mining operations went from bad to worse and he was no longer able to afford going to the West every summer for a span of ten years. Things only got worse as Cope was turned down again and again for curator and professorial positions across the U.S. Cope was then forced to rent out his second house on Pine Street and in 1886 his family was forced to move to a small house on the property formerly built for the servants of their grand townhouses. The American Naturalist publishers went bankrupt, the problem being that the review never made any money. Normally Cope would have taken money out of his own pocket to pay the difference, but he was no longer capable of doing so. Cope also had to deal with the thought of losing his enormous fossil collection. John Wesley Powell, the new head of the U.S. Geological Survey team, at the urging of Marsh continued to deny the money to publish his works from the Hayden surveys. This time however Powell pushed for Cope to give back all the specimens that he had unearthed during his employment under the auspices of the U.S. government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, who in all fairness had used over 75,000 dollars of his own money in the 1870 s when he was working with the survey teams. Cope s response after continued hearings before congress members was to simply take the case to the newspapers. Nothing eventually happened to Cope, or his collection but Powell was forced to ask Marsh, who had intervened in the debacle, to resign from his position as the chief paleontologist for the survey teams. 49 


Through his years of financial hardship he was still somehow able to continue publishing papers and in 1889 received a position at the 

University of Pennsylvania
 as the professor of zoology. 50 It was a small yearly stipend but it was enough for the family to move back into one of the townhouses so that Cope could resume some of his works again. Not until the 
Texas Geological Survey offered Cope a position in their expeditions in the summers of 1892 was he able to get back into the field once again. His finances having improved, he was able to publish a massive work on the Batrachians of North America, which was the most detailed analysis and organization of the continent's frogs and amphibians ever mastered.51  Then he would publish an equally daunting book with 1,115 pages, The Crocodilians Lizards and Snakes of North America. These two books along with his short essays on amphibians and reptiles would place Cope as one of the pillars of scientists in these fields. The 

Copeia
,the foremost journal for ichthyologists and herpetologists, was named in Cope s honor in 1915 because of his work in the field.  In the 1890 s his publication rate went back up to an average of 43 articles a year until his death in 1897.52




Death



After many years of working in hostile and extreme conditions, Cope s overexertion over the years finally caught up with him. Cope was confined for a time to bed as his gastrointestinal problems became worse in 1897. His self medication of formalin, a substance based of formaldehyde, used to preserve specimens only made the sickness worse and on April 12, 1897 Cope passed away in his Pine Street home. His brain was removed and given to the 


Wistar Institute

 at the 

University of Pennsylvania
. His ashes were placed at the institute with his friends Joseph Leidy and Dr. Ryder. His bones were to be extracted and kept in a locked drawer, not to be put up on exhibit, but to be studied by anatomy students at the University. 53  Many believed Cope had died of syphilis that he had contracted in his travels from the many women he fraternized with. However this theory was laid to rest when Jane Davidson, author of the Bone Sharp, was able to gain permission to have the skeleton examined by a medical doctor at the university. Dr. Morrie Kricun a professor of radiology in 1995 came to the conclusion that there was absolutely no evidence of bony syphilis on Cope s skeleton. 54 


His wife Annie was given all his possessions,  showing  that although the two had divorced, they stayed quite close. His fossil collections were to be donated to various museums, with the bulk going to the American Museum of Natural History. In 1939 Julia donated all his memoirs and surviving letters to the museum as well. Whatever could be sold off was, enabling Julia to have a more comfortable life. Cope also paid credit to his longtime collectors and employees by setting aside money for them as well.	


Julia would not comment on the name of the woman in whom her father had had the love affair with in Washington D.C. prior to his first European travel. It is believed that Julia burned any of the  scandalous letters and journals that Cope had kept but many of his friends were able to give their recollections of the scandalous nature of some of Cope s unpublished routines. 
Charles Knight, a former friend called,  Cope s mouth the filthiest, from hearsay that in his heyday [Copes s] no woman was safe within five miles (8 km) of him. 55 Julia was the major financer behind Henry Osborn s Cope: The Master Naturalist, and therefore wanted to keep her father s name in good standing and refused to comment on any misdeeds her father may have committed.





Personal beliefs


His views on human evolution would today be considered racist, but for the time were used by many scientists as an excuse for imperialism. He believed that if,  a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like. 56  However he was not opposed to blacks because of the color of their skin but to their  degrading vices,  believing that the  inferior Negro should go back to Africa. 57  He did not blame blacks for their bad vices, but wrote that,  A vulture will always eat carrion when surrounded on all hands by every kind of cleaner food. It is the nature of the bird. 58  Cope was against women s rights, believing in the husband s role as protector. He published papers on the marriage problem, noting that women were muscularly inferior to men because they did not have the jobs that required them to have muscles. Strangely enough he believed in education for women and people of all races, in order to make oneself a better individual and to better contribute to society. 


Cope was raised as a Quaker, and was taught that the bible was literal truth. Though he never confronted his family about their religious views, Osborn writes that Cope was at least aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes:  If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the bible ... he did not express them in his letters to his family but there can be little question ... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period. 59
Biographer Jane Davidson writes that Osborn seems to have overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. Davidson ascribes Cope's deference to his father's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father's financial support.60



Scientific theories


Cope was a staunch 
Neo-Lamarkian.61 He read 


Charles Darwin

 s Voyage of a Naturalist and Schiller s Thirty Years War, the former having little effect in the young Cope. The only comment recorded by Cope was that Darwin had discussed,  too much geology,  from the account of his voyage.62 


In 1887, Cope published his own Origin of the Fittest: Essays in Evolution. 63 Cope was one on the strongest American supporters of the Neo-Lamarckism school of evolution, he believed in evolution, but not in Darwin s theory of natural selection as a means to that end. Cope was a strong believer in the law of use and disuse, that an individual will slowly, over time, favor an anatomical part of its body so much that it will become stronger and larger as time progresses down the generations. The giraffe, for example, stretched its neck to reach taller trees and passed this acquired characteristics to its offspring in the new developmental phase that is added on to the fetus in the womb. This new stage of sharing of genetics would be added on after all gestation is completed and the offspring is ready to be conceived. 64 	





Legacy


In less than 40 years as a scientist Cope published over 1,200 scientific papers, a record that still stands to this day.65  These include three major volumes: On the Origin of Genera (1867), The Vertebrata of the Tertiary Formations of the West (1884:  Cope's bible ) and The Origin of the Fittest: Essays in Evolution (1887). His greatest anatomical generalization on the origin of mammalian molars and  Cope s Law  on the gradual enlargement of a population lineage tends to increase body size over geological time,66 are testaments to the brilliance and attention to detail that Cope commanded. He was an outspoken proponent for Neo-Lamarckism and although he loved his own theories,  he was never blind to the possibility of them being disproved. 67  During his career he discovered and described over 1,000 species of fossil vertebrates and published 600 separate titles.68  The most prolific journal on amphibians and reptiles, Copeia, is named after him, as well as many other species that he discovered or was named in his honor, such as the Gambelia copeii. He was an active member of many different scientific societies, most notably the American Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical society. His childhood home at  Fairfield  and his Pine Street homes are recognized as national landmarks.69  A plaque honoring Cope stands outside the Academy of Natural Sciences and countless other memorials across the U.S. have been erected in Cope s name.

Beer organisations




The Beer Judge Certification Program or BJCP is a 
non-profit organization formed in 
1985  to promote beer literacy and the appreciation of real beer, and to recognize beer tasting and evaluation skills.  It has been described in the press as  a systematic, academic and hands-on ... study program designed to teach aspiring beer enthusiasts about the essence of any kind of beer . 1 The BJCP certifies and ranks beer judges through an examination and monitoring process. Membership is limited to beer judges who have taken the BJCP exam. 
As of 2005, the BJCP has over 2000 active members, primarily in the 
United States of America.


Purpose



The BJCP has three functions within the 
US beer community.  First, it provides a standards-based organization supplying qualified judges to both amateur and commercial brewing competitions designed to promote the appreciation of 
beer styles and their accurate production by brewers.  The BJCP tracks members' participation as judges, organizers, or stewards in BJCP-sanctioned brewing competitions and awards 
continuing education units for participation.


The BJCP also publishes 
style guidelines categorizing 
beer, 
cider, and 
mead into twenty-eight style categories. These guidelines are used in both the examination of beer judges by the BJCP and, voluntarily, by brewing competition organizers; the BJCP also encourages prospective test-takers to study the available literature on styles and brewing. The most recent revision of the style guidelines was published in February 2008, a relatively minor revision to the 2004 style guidelines.2


Finally, the BJCP organizes a program of beer examinations wherein test-takers complete a series of written questions regarding 
brewing, 
beer styles and judging and then perform four beer judging exercises.




Organization



Through accumulation of participation credits (called experience points) and high performance on the exam, members may rise through the BJCP ranks:



 Recognized


 Certified


 National


 Master


 Grand Master (with additional awards of Level I, Level II, etc.)


The BJCP also awards the special ranks of  
Apprentice  and  Honorary Master .




Influence



In its early years, BJCP judges and the BJCP style guidelines were used almost exclusively by 
homebrewers, but the demand for experienced and credentialed beer judges in competitions among commercial breweries has grown substantially in recent years. Judges are not normally compensated for their service at a competition, although incidental expenses may be reimbursed. Its standards for beers have been cited by the Wall Street Journal3 and by Zymurgy, the journal of home beer brewing.45678910


The BJCP is largely a North American organization, with a few members living in other parts of the world.2 Membership in other countries, including Australia11 and South Africa, has been increasing, and the organization has attracted interest from England12 and Scotland.




History



The BJCP was founded in 1985, when the first exam was given at the 




American Homebrewers Association



 (AHA) annual conference in 
Estes Park, 





Colorado




. During its formative years, the program was jointly sponsored by the AHA and the 
Home Wine and Beer Trade Association (HWBTA). Both organizations sanctioned local homebrew competitions, and each had a national competition. Consequently, both were interested in fostering the improvement of judging skills and building up a pool of experienced beer judges. The program was administered at the AHA offices, and there were two Co-Directors, one from each association. Jim Homer was the AHA Co-Director, and Pat Baker served the same role for the HWBTA.13


In August, 1995, after a successful ten year history, support was withdrawn by the AHA, which had intentions of starting its own beer judging program. The HWBTA was unable to continue operating the program by itself, so the BJCP was expected to simply fade away. However, a considerable number of judges had been built up by this time, and many of them were quite active. A small number of these activists decided that the program could be operated solely by volunteers from among themselves, and decided to attempt the continuation of the BJCP as an independent entity.


The effort was coordinated in a haphazard fashion, mainly through 
e-mail, but a consensus gradually emerged and the program was able to continue its vigorous growth. A Board of Directors was established to guide the program, comprised of six (currently seven) Regional Representatives elected by members from each of seven geographical regions throughout 



North America


. The U.S. was divided into geographic regions, and an election for the Board of Directors was held by mailing ballots to members.14


Assisting the Board was program administrator Russ Wigglesworth, who remained in his post and assumed the duties of maintaining the database of members, sending program materials to competition organizers, providing certificates and pins to new and newly promoted judges, and performing other essential administrative tasks. Wigglesworth remains in his position, but began to transfer his duties to other members in 2004 and 
as of 2006 this transfer is nearly complete.


In the early years, there were regional elections for the Board, conducted entirely by postal ballot, and a newsletter was published for several years to inform the membership. An annual letter was also sent by the Program Administrator to each member, listing the experience points earned from judging in various competitions. These activities are now done electronically, with the BJCP website serving as the repository of information including a password-protected section where members can check their personal record, and website voting, competition registration, and point reporting.

Cinema of Taiwan










 
East Asian cinema






 



Cinema of China





 
Cinema of Hong Kong


 
Cinema of Taiwan


 
Cinema of Japan


 
Cinema of Korea


 
Cinema of Mongolia





The history of 

Chinese-language
 
cinema has three separate threads of development: 
Cinema of Hong Kong, 



Cinema of China


 and Cinema of Taiwan. 

Taiwan
ese cinema grew up outside of the 

Hong Kong
 mainstream and the censorship of the 

People's Republic of China
.

Taiwanese cinema is deeply rooted in the island's 
unique and rapidly changing history. Since its introduction to Taiwan in 1901, cinema has developed in Taiwan through several distinct stages.



Early cinema, 1900   1970s 


From 1900 to 1937, Taiwanese cinema was strongly influenced by the Japanese. This was during the Japanese colonial era, and many conventions in Japanese films were adopted by the Taiwanese filmmakers. For example, the use of a 
benshi (narrator of silent films), which was a very important component of the film-going experience in Japan, was adopted and renamed benzi by the Taiwanese. This narrator was very different from its equivalent in the Western world. It rapidly evolved into a star system. In fact, people would go to see the very same film narrated by different 
benshi, to hear the other benshi's interpretation. A romance could become a comedy or a drama, depending on the narrator's style and skills. Lu, a famous actor and 
benshi in Taiwan wrote the best reference book on Taiwan cinema. 


The first Taiwanese benshi master was a musician and composer named Wang Yung-feng, who had played on a regular basis for the orchestra at the Fang Nai Ting Theatre in Taipei. He was also the composer of the music for the Chinese film Tao hua qi xue ji (China, Peach girl, 1921) in Shanghai.  


Other famous Taiwanese benshi masters were Lu Su-Shang and Zhan Tian-Ma. Lu Su-shang, is not primarily remembered for his benshi performances, but mainly because he wrote the inestimable history of cinema and drama in Taiwan, the bible of Taiwanese film history. The most famous of all was Zhan Tian-ma, whose story is told in a recent Taiwanese biographical film, March of Happiness (Taiwan, 1999, dir: Lin Sheng-shing).


Benshi masters were intellectuals: they spoke Japanese, often travelled to Japan and/or China, and were poets writing their own libretto for each film. Since 1910, films had been distributed with a script, but these poets of the darkness would rather explore their personal style. Notable films during this period include The Eyes of Buddha (1922) and Whose Fault Is It (1925). 


Then, with the 

Second Sino-Japanese War
 came the Japanization era and Taiwan was restricted to playing Japanese repertoire only. The Japanese strove to transform the locals into Japanese citizens, giving them Japanese names, a Japanese education, encouraging them to wear Japanese clothes and asking the men to cut their long hair.


Hou Hsiao-Hsien
's film,  The Puppetmaster  (1993), witnesses vividly this moment of history. 


In 1937, the 

Second Sino-Japanese War
 interrupted the movie industry, and virtually nothing was produced until after the 

National government
 took over Taiwan in 1945.


To read more concerning the Japanese rule period, see:  Dancing shadows of film exhibition: Taiwan and the Japanese influence , by Jeanne Deslandes : .


Taiwanese cinema grew again after 1949, when the end of the 
Chinese civil war brought many filmmakers sympathetic to the 
Nationalists to Taiwan. During this era, the primary films produced were 

Mandarin
 films officially sanctioned by the government. As the government was attempting to unify the country by declaring Mandarin as the official language, the use of other dialects was controlled, and non-Mandarin films (e.g. 

Taiwanese
 language films) gradually declined.


The 1960s marked the beginning of Taiwan's rapid modernization. The government focused strongly on the economy, industrial development, and education, and in 1963 the Central Motion Picture Corporation (CMPC) introduced the  Health Realism  melodrama. This film genre was proposed to help build traditional moral values, which were deemed important during the rapid transformation of the nation's socioeconomic structure. During this time, traditional 
kung-fu films as well as romantic melodramas were also quite popular. The author 
Qiong Yao is especially famous for the movies made in this time period which were based on her widely-read romantic novels.


Taiwanese cinema of this period is related to  
censorship in the Republic of China and 
Propaganda in the Republic of China.




New Wave Cinema, 1982   1990



By the early 1980s, the popularity of home video made film-watching a wide-spread activity for the Taiwanese. However, the Taiwanese film industry was under serious challenges, such as the entry of Hong Kong films, well-known for their entertainment quality, into the Taiwanese market. In order to compete with Hong Kong films, the CMPC began an initiative to support several fresh, young directors. In 1982, the film 
In Our Time (1982), which featured four young talented directors (

Edward Yang
, 
Tao De-chen, 
Ke I-jheng, and 
Jhang Yi), began what would be known as the rejuvenation of Taiwanese cinema: the 
New Wave Cinema.


In contrast to the melodrama or kung-fu action films of the earlier decades, New Wave films are known for their realistic, down-to-earth, and sympathetic portrayals of Taiwanese life. These films sought to portray genuine stories of people living either in urban or rural Taiwan, and are often compared stylistically to the films of the 












Italian neorealism











 movement. This emphasis on realism was further enhanced by innovative narrative techniques. For example, the conventional narrative structure which builds the drama to a climax was abandoned. Rather, the story progressed at the pace as it would in real life.  


Due to its honest portrayal of life, New Wave films examined many of the important issues facing Taiwan society at this time, such as urbanization, the struggle against poverty, and conflicts with political authority. For instance, 

Hou Hsiao-Hsien
's 

A City of Sadness
 portrays the tensions and the conflicts between the local Taiwanese and the newly arrived Chinese Nationalist government after the end of the Japanese occupation. Edward Yang's 
Taipei Story (1985) and 
A Confucian Confusion (1994) talk about the confusion of traditional values and modern materialism among young urbanites in the 1980s and 1990s. The New Wave Cinema films are, therefore, a fascinating chronicle of Taiwan's socio-economic and political transformation in modern times.




Second New Wave, 1990   present


The New Wave gradually gave way to what could be informally called the Second New Wave, which are slightly less serious and more amenable to the populace, although just as committed to portraying the Taiwanese perspective. 


For example, 

Tsai Ming-liang
's 

Vive L'Amour
, which won the Golden Lion at the 1994 

Venice Film Festival
, portrays the isolation, despair, and love of young adults living in the upscale apartments of Taipei. 









Stan Lai








's 
The Peach Blossom Land (1992) is a tragi-comedy involving two groups of actors rehearsing different plays on the same stage; the masterful juxtaposition and the depth of the play's political and psychological meanings helped it win recognition at festivals in Tokyo and Berlin. 




Ang Lee
 is perhaps the most well-known of the Second New Wave director. His early films Pushing Hands (1991), The Wedding Banquet (1993), and 

Eat Drink Man Woman
 (1994) focus on the generational and cultural conflicts confronting so many modern families. 
His 

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
 (2000) revived the 
wuxia genre successfully.  Although not in the tradition of New Wave or Second New Wave, it is a commercial success which placed Asian films firmly in the international domain.

Arthur Holly Compton (September 10, 1892   March 15, 1962) was an American physicist and 










Nobel laureate









 in physics for his discovery of the 
Compton effect. He served as Chancellor of 

Washington University in St. Louis
 from 1945 to 1953.



Biography



Early years


Arthur Holly Compton was born in 

Wooster, Ohio
 in 1892 to 
Elias and 
Otelia Compton. They were an academic family; his father Elias Compton was dean of The University of Wooster (later 

The College of Wooster
), which Arthur attended. His eldest brother 














Karl Taylor Compton













 also attended The University of Wooster, became a physicist, and was later president of 
MIT; his second brother 
Wilson M. Compton became a diplomat and president of the State College of Washington, later 

Washington State University
. Around 1913, Compton devised a demonstration method for the 
Earth's 
rotation. 


In 1918, Compton began studying 
X-ray scattering. In 1922, Compton found that X-ray wavelengths increase due to scattering of the 
radiant energy by  
free electrons . The scattered 
quanta have less energy than the quanta of the original ray. This discovery, known as the  Compton effect,  or  
Compton scattering  demonstrates the  
particle  concept of 
electromagnetic radiation and earned Compton the 

Nobel Prize
 in physics in 1927. Compton developed the method for observing at the same instant individual scattered 
X-ray 
photons and the 
recoil 
electrons (developed with 
Alfred W. Simon). In Germany, 

Walther Bothe
 and 

Hans Geiger
 independently developed a similar method.




Wartime activities


In 1941, along with 


Vannevar Bush

, head of the wartime 
Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), and 

Ernest Lawrence
, the inventor of the 
cyclotron, Compton helped to take over the then-stagnant American program to develop an 
atomic bomb. Compton was placed in charge of the OSRD's 
S-1 Committee charged with investigating the properties and manufacture of 
uranium. In 1942, Compton appointed 


Robert Oppenheimer

 as the Committee's top 
theorist. When the Committee's work was taken over by the 
Army in the summer of 1942, it became the 











Manhattan Project










. 


Immediately after the 
Japanese attack on 


Pearl Harbor

 on December 7, 1941, Compton gained support for consolidating 
plutonium research at the 

University of Chicago
 and for an ambitious schedule that called for producing the first atomic bomb in January 1945, a goal that was missed by only six months.  
Metallurgical Laboratory  or  Met Lab  was the  cover  name given to Compton's facility. Its objectives were to produce 
chain-reacting  piles  of uranium to convert to plutonium, find ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to design a bomb. In December 1942, underneath 

Chicago
's 





Stagg Field




, a team of Met Lab scientists directed by 


Enrico Fermi

 achieved a sustained chain reaction in the world's first 
nuclear reactor. Throughout the war, Compton would remain a prominent scientific adviser and administrator.




Washington University in St. Louis


Compton returned to 

Washington University in St. Louis
, where he had served as Head of the Department of Physics from 1920 to 1923, when he was inaugurated as the university's ninth Chancellor in 1946.


During Compton's time as Chancellor, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions in 1952, named its first female full professor, and enrolled a record number of students as wartime veterans returned to the United States. His reputation and connections in national scientific circles allowed him to recruit many nationally renowned scientific researchers to the university. Despite Compton's accomplishments, he was criticized then, and subsequently by historians, for moving slowly toward full 
racial integration, making Washington University the last major institution of higher learning in 

St. Louis
 to open its doors to 



African American


s.1


Compton resigned as Chancellor in 1953, but remained on the faculty until his retirement from the full-time faculty in 1961.




 Personal details 


Along with being an academic his father was a Presbyterian clergyman. At least for a time Arthur Compton was a deacon at a Baptist Church. He also played the mandolin and was a scientific glassblower.2





Legacy


Compton is buried in the Wooster Cemetery in Wooster, Ohio. 


Compton crater

 on the 
Moon is co-named for Arthur Compton and his brother 














Karl













. The physics research building at Washington University in St Louis is named in his honor.  The University of Chicago Residence Halls remembered Compton and his achievements by dedicating 
Compton House in his honor. Compton also has a star on the 









St. Louis Walk of Fame








.  


The 








Arthur H. Compton House







 in 

Chicago
 is listed as a 



National Historic Landmark


.


Compton also invented a more gentle, elongated, and ramped version of the 
speed bump called a  Holly hump,  many of which are on the roads of the 

Washington University in St. Louis
 campus.




NASA
's 







Compton Gamma Ray Observatory






 was named in honor of Compton. The Compton effect is central to the 
gamma ray detection instruments aboard the observatory.

FX (for Fox eXtended) is the name of a number of related subscription TV channels owned by 

News Corporation
's 

Fox Entertainment Group
.  The network's most popular original shows are  


The Shield

, 

Nip/Tuck
, 

Rescue Me
 and 
Damages, as well as the comedy 
It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. The networks mainly broadcast original programming aired on 
FOX in the 1990s and 2000s.

 History 



1994 1997





fX logo used from 
June 1, 
1994 to mid-1997



The first fX channel was launched in the 








United States







 on 
June 1, 
1994. Broadcasting from a large  apartment  in 

Manhattan
's 





Flatiron District




, fX ushered in a new era of interactive television, but did not exist long enough to see the eventual success of such interactivity. The network centered around original programming, broadcast live every day from the  fX Apartment , and rebroadcasts of kitschy shows from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. 


fX had two taglines:  TV Made Fresh Daily  and  The World's First Living Television Network .1 The  f  was lower-case to portray a type of relaxed friendliness. The stylized  X  represented the network's roots: the crossing spotlights of the 

20th Century Fox
 logo.


The live shows were mostly focused one topic. Shows included Personal fX (collectibles), The Pet Department (pets), Under Scrutiny with Jane Wallace (news), and Sound fX (music). The network's flagship show, Breakfast Time(hosted by Laurie Hibberd and 
Tom Bergeron), was formatted like an informal magazine show, and was an Americanized version of Great Britain's 

The Big Breakfast
. Breakfast Time and Personal fX would regularly feature the network's  roving reporters  visiting unique places around America. 






Suzanne Whang





 (now of 
HGTV), 

John Burke
 (now of 

E!
) and 













Phil Keoghan












 (now of 

CBS
's 
The Amazing Race) were some of the roving reporters.


The network prided itself on its interactivity with viewers. fX, in 
1994, was the first television network to openly embrace 
e-mail and the 

World Wide Web
 as methods of feedback. Most of the shows would feature instant responses to e-mailed questions, and one show, 
Backchat (hosted by 
Survivor host 




Jeff Probst



), was exclusively devoted to responding to viewer mail, whether e-mailed or mailed traditionally. Select viewers were allowed to spend a day at the  apartment  and take part in all of the network's shows. 


fX's viewer base was very loyal, but the budget was simply too high for the clearance the network was receiving. Ironically, the first incarnation of fX was not even available on the local cable system in New York City, where programming originated. During the time the network launched in the mid-1990s, cable systems around the United States were upgrading their infrastructures to increase channel capacity and were not regularly adding channels until these upgrades were complete. The same problem plagued 

Fox News Channel
 around its early 1996 launch. 


The live shows were cancelled one-by-one until only Personal fX remained. Breakfast Time was moved to the 

FOX network
 and renamed FOX After Breakfast in mid-
1996. It never found a substantial audience and was cancelled less than a year later. Eventually, all live programming with the exception of Personal fX was dropped and the network focused entirely on its classic television shows until its relaunch in mid-
1997. Personal fX remained on the refocused FX until 
May 1, 
1998.


FX vacated the  apartment  in the summer of 1998 and the network's operations were streamlined with the other Fox-owned cable networks.




1997 2001





FX logo used from mid-1997 until 
December 18, 
2007. The lime green coloring was added in 2004 during an image campaign. The logo was recently seen as of April 13, 2008 when the network interrupted scheduled programming for a baseball game.





fX was relaunched as 'FX: Fox Gone Cable'2 in early 
1997, targeting men aged 18 to 49. The network is known for original drama 
series and 

NASCAR
 programming. 


During the first few years after its relaunch, FX was known for little else than airing reruns of such 

Fox
 shows as 

The X-Files
 and 
Married... with Children, as well as 

20th Century Fox
 shows such as 

M*A*S*H
 and 

Buffy the Vampire Slayer
. Soon after its relaunch, the tagline  Fox Gone Cable  was dropped.  When the cable reruns of 

Ally McBeal
 and 

The Practice
 fumbled in primetime, FX predominantly ran movies in their more high-profile time periods.


After obtaining the spring broadcast rights to NASCAR, 
Fox Sports announced that for their inaugural 2001 season, FX would serve as their cable partner. This meant that FX would cover several races in the series then known as the 

Busch Series
 and 
Winston Cup (including the 










All-Star Race









), as well as select qualifying and final practice sessions. The move was meant to promote the network and cause NASCAR fans to contact their cable providers to add the channel to their line-up. In 2002, network president Peter Liguori praised NASCAR from moving the number of available homes from 58.5 million to 76.6 million.3


fX aired numerous 

Major League Baseball
 on Saturday Nights in 2001, including 

Cal Ripken, Jr.
's final game at 
Camden Yards.




2002 2007


In recent years, however, the network has emerged as a major force in original cable programming, gaining both acclaim and notoriety for edgy dramas. This began in 
2002 with the release of its breakout hit, police drama 


The Shield

.  This trend continued the following year with 

Nip/Tuck
, which chronicles the world of plastic surgery, and the 

Denis Leary
-helmed 

Rescue Me
, about 
FDNY firemen and their lives and in 2007 with 

Dirt
, a show starring 

Courteney Cox
 about a ruthless tabloid editor who seeks out the truth. Unlike many broadcast networks, FX is willing to take risks with their programming and push the envelope of what can be shown on television, having high, 
TV-MA ratings. Opinions on these shows are mixed.  Some organizations, like the 



Parents Television Council


 and 












American Family Association











, have asked advertisers to 
boycott these shows due to their graphic content.45  However, the shows are also critically acclaimed for their strong storylines and characters. 


Capitalizing on the success of the hit documentary 

Super Size Me
, creator 




Morgan Spurlock



 launched a new series, 

30 Days
, on FX in June 2005. The series puts its subjects in situations uncomfortable to them for 30 days, such as making millionaires work for minimum wage, and having Christians live in a Muslim community.


In the summer of 
2005, FX debuted two new comedy series, 

Starved
, about the daily lives of four friends with eating disorders who live in New York, and 

It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
, about four people who own a bar in the titular city and somehow always wind up having comic misadventures, usually very un-
PC. Both of these shows feature frank sexual dialogue and strong language, pitched as  The Dark Side of Comedy . While Starved gained low ratings and was derided by groups that sought to publicize eating disorders, being canceled after its first season, Sunny quickly became a critics' darling, consistently achieved high ratings and was picked up for a second season within days of its first season finale. An edited version of Sunny was aired by 

Fox
 for a three-episode run in the summer of 
2006, in an effort to promote it on FX.


In 2006, FX debuted two new series, the 
reality television show 












Black. White.











 and the drama 

Thief
 but neither were picked up for a second season. After 2006, FX also no longer broadcast NASCAR, as sister network 
Speed Channel became the new cable partner for 
NASCAR on Fox.


Throughout 
2007, FX inroduced three new dramas, 

Dirt
 starring 

Courteney Cox
, 

The Riches
 starring 


Eddie Izzard

 and 



Minnie Driver


, and 

Damages
 starring 


Glenn Close

 and 

Ted Danson
. All three did well in the ratings and were renewed for second seasons. 


On October 15, 2007 a high definition feed was launched on DirecTV and recently on few select Comcast markets.


As of 
2008, the channel was available in 90.6 million U.S. homes.




2008-present



In 2008, the network launched a new branding campaign built around the theme There Is No Box, which was influenced by the phrase  
outside the box  and refers to how the network's programming goes beyond the box concept, as well as a pun on the network competing against premium channels such as HBO, with its original programming. The network's logo changed on 
December 18, 
2007 and uses only the FX letters for branding by removing the 
klieg light logo box to the left. As of 
August 21, 
2008, on-screen graphics are being updated to match the new logo. The new branding includes an advertising campaign, featuring a post-game ad for the network during Fox's coverage of 






Super Bowl XLII

Over the last year, competition between other cable networks has increased, evident in the second season ratings for less successful series, Dirt and The Riches, which have had ratings decrease significantly since their first seasons last year. Some weeks viewers were barely over 1 million. 


John Landgraff told 

Entertainment Weekly
 that things are slow at the network because  It's a combination of the strike having us scrambling, and trying to figure out what shows are compatible where.  He also said that Damages will debut its second season in January the earliest and the next season of Rescue Me will premiere in the spring with minisodes airing during summer 2008 to hold fans over.


In 2008, the network picked up 

Sons of Anarchy
, about a notorious 
outlaw motorcycle club bent on protecting their sheltered California town from corporate developers and drug dealers. It is from The Shield executive producer, 



Kurt Sutter


 and premiered in September, coinciding with The Shield's final season Sons of Anarchy airs Wednesdays. Sons of Anarchy stars 

Charlie Hunnam
, 


Katey Sagal

 and 


Ron Perlman

.


On 
May 19, 
2008, FX president John Landgraff signed a contract to be head of the network for at least three more years. He intends to expand the lineup to include more comedies in addition to their award-winning dramas as well as the launch of a new website. He also announced that FX would start airing 
Two and a Half Men starting next year and that they have enough episodes of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia to start syndicating it.


On 
June 8, 
2008, Courteney Cox announced herself that FX has chosen not to renew Dirt for a third season and that it had been canceled. 


In July 2008, several announcements were made regarding FX's series. It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia has been picked up for an additional 39 episodes, giving it 3 more seasons. Nip/Tuck will end after it's sixth season. The 8 episodes will act as the remainder of season five and will air in 2009 while 19 more episodes will be split in half for season six. It will possibly go into syndication after ending with a total of 100 episodes. Also announced was a new comedy called Testees about two friends who act as test subjects. 


In July 2008, they removed 
Dharma and Greg, 
Buffy the Vampire Slayer and 
Married... with Children from the schedule.


The Riches experiences a major hit in ratings this year. The second season wrapped up on April 29, 2008 and while fans expected an answer on season three quickly, FX couldn't make a decision. Landgraff said  We're really struggling with the decision. On the one hand, I love the show. I'm tremendously proud of it. It's a very challenging tone to take on. We felt it wobbled in the beginning, but I think we really stuck the landing finally and it developed into something terrific..It's always a little bit of a question, do you hold onto the past or strive for the future.  FX tried to shop The Riches to DirecTV. Unfortunately, it seemed that DirecTV did not pick it up because it costs too much to produce and even with a budget cut, it wouldn't work out because of low ratings.8 According to Todd Stashwick, the show was canceled on September 25, 2008, almost five months after season two ended and without an appropriate conclusion. On October 7, 2008, FX officially confirmed the show's demise.9


In late August 2008, FX launched a new website. They mention that full episodes of FX shows will soon be made available for viewing on the website. As of October 2008, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, 30 Days, and Sons of Anarchy are available for viewing through the official FX site.


The new FX comedy, Testees is set to premiere October 9, 2008.


Sons of Anarchy was renewed for a second season on October 6, 2008.10

Dumplings
German cuisine








Pickerts from Lippe



A Pickert is a flat, fried or baked potato 
dish from 
Westphalia, 

Germany
. It can be considered a kind of flattened 
dumpling or very nourishing 
pancake. It comes as a round Pfannenpickert the size of a pan, a rectangular Kastenpickert or palm-sized regular Pickert. The name is derived from 

Low German
 picken, pecken ( to stick something onto something else ).


The principal ingredients are grated potatoes, flour, milk, eggs, and (usually) raisins, with a little yeast, salt and sugar, and oil for the baking. Three big potatoes produce 10-15 palm-sized pickerts, enough for 4-5 people. If one is not very hungry, a single Pfannenpickert may well make a satisfying meal.


Pickerts are a specialty of the district of 

Lippe
, where they developed from a traditional meal for the poorer people. In former times, Pickert was eaten as breakfast or lunch by poor farmers, being a cheap and very nourishing dish, as would be required of food for a day's work in the fields. They are now served spread with 
sugar beet syrup, butter or (plum) jam, or even 
leberwurst.


A related dish, Lappenpickert, is found in the regions west of Lippe, towards 
Munster and the 
Ruhr Area. It does not usually contain raisins and yeast, but may have a dash of 
sweet cream added. Lappenpickert is usually baked in rather thin pancakes on a 
griddle greased with a side of 
lard, and eaten with the same spreads as Pickerts from Lippe, or with smoked fish or 
cold cuts.

Ocean's Eleven

2004


 sequel, 


Ocean's Twelve

I never thought for a second that people were really going to think that s what I was like. I think that people will know that I was faking it in those movies,  he told Flaunt magazine in 2007.11 He planned to cameo in 

Ocean's Thirteen

Jack Greenberg










, opposite 

Terrence Howard
, who will play 

Thurgood Marshall
.13

Species



Cupressus   leylandii
also:
Cupressus   notabilis
Cupressus   ovensii''




The Leyland Cypress, X Cupressocyparis leylandii (syn. Callitropsis   leylandii), is often referred to as just Leylandii. It is a fast-growing 
evergreen tree much used in 
horticulture, primarily for hedges and screens. Its name originates from C.J. Leyland, a sea captain, whom commanded a ship known as the I.S.S. Enterprise, who grew some of the first hybrids on his property, 










Haggerston Castle









, in Northumbria, in 1888.


The Leyland Cypress is a 
hybrid between the 
Monterey Cypress, Cupressus macrocarpa (
syn. Callitropsis macrocarpa), and the 
Nootka Cypress, Cupressus nootkatensis (syn. Callitropsis nootkatensis), family 
Cupressaceae, both are natives of the mountains of the North American west coast. The hybrid has arisen on nearly 20 separate occasions, always by open pollination, showing the two species are readily compatible and closely related. Two other similar hybrids have also been raised, both involving Nootka Cypress with other Cupressus species:


Cupressus arizonica var. glabra   Cupressus nootkatensis (Cupressus   notabilis)

:Cupressus lusitanica   Cupressus nootkatensis (Cupressus   ovensii)


The taxonomic status of Nootka Cypress is disputed; in the past, it was widely regarded as belonging in the genus 
Chamaecyparis, and in 
2002 it was classified in a new genus Xanthocyparis. The most recent treatments (
2004), however, transfer it to 
Callitropsis.  In any of these treatments, the hybrids become very unusual in being intergeneric hybrids, the only ones ever reported among the 
Gymnosperms. In fact the very existence of these hybrids, and their ease of formation, is a further strong pointer (in addition to genetic and morphological evidence) for the treatment of Nootka cypress in 
Cupressus. Little (2006) has proposed an another alternative by transferring all the North American species of 
Cupressus, including the Monterey Cypress, to 
Callitropsis1. It may be added that attempts to cross Nootka cypress with other Chamaecyparis species have been universally unsuccessful.


Where Nootka Cypress is treated in Chamaecyparis, the name of the hybrid becomes   Cupressocyparis leylandii, and where treated in Xanthocyparis, it becomes   Cuprocyparis leylandii.


Leyland Cypresses are commonly planted in gardens to provide a quick boundary or shelter hedge, because of their rapid growth.





Leylandii foliage in place on the tree





It is poorly adapted to areas with hot summers, such as the southern half of the 
U.S.A., and in these areas becomes very prone to the 
disease cypress 
canker caused by the 
fungus Seridium cardinale. This causes extensive dieback and ultimately death of the tree. In 

California
's 












Central Valley











, they rarely live more than ten years before succumbing, and not much longer in southern states like 





Alabama




. In these areas, the canker-resistant 
Arizona Cypress is much more successful.


In Northern areas where heavy snows occur, this plant is also susceptible to broken branches and even uprooting in wet, heavy snow. 


Note: Caution should be exercised when handling tree clippings - after trimming, for example.  The sap can cause skin irritation in susceptible individuals.



Legal aspects


The Cypress' rapid growth (up to a metre per year), heavy shade and great potential height (often over 20 m tall in garden conditions, they can reach at least 35 m) can make them a problem. In 
Britain they have been the source of a number of high profile disputes between neighbours, even leading to violence (and in one recent case, 
murder), because of their capacity to cut out light.  Part VIII of the 
Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 introduced a way for people affected by high hedges (usually, but not necessarily, of leylandii) to ask their local authority to investigate complaints about the hedges, and gave the authorities power to have the hedges reduced in height2.


In May 2008, a UK woman, Christine Wright, won a 24 year legal battle to have her neighbor's Leylandii trees cut down for blocking sunlight to her garden.

Motto:




USS Hawkbill (SSN-666), a 



Sturgeon-class


 
submarine, was the second ship of the 






United States Navy





 to be named for the 
hawksbill, a large 
sea turtle. (The name perpetuated the inadvertent misspelling in the naming of 



USS Hawkbill''


 (SS-366).)

The contract to build her was awarded to the 


Mare Island

 Division of 

San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard
 in 

Vallejo, California
 on 
18 December 
1964 and her keel was laid down on 
12 September 
1966.  She was 
launched on 
12 April 
1969 sponsored by Mrs. Bernard F. Roeder, and 
commissioned on 
4 February 
1971, with Commander Christopher H. Brown in command.


Hawkbill was sometimes called  The Devil Boat  or the Devilfish because of chapter 13 of the 
Revelation of Saint John the Divine, which begins  And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea....  and ends  Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.   The Michael DiMercurio novel Voyage of the Devilfish features the vessel renamed as such.


1980-1984


In 1980, the USS Hawkbill (SSN-666) completed a scheduled overhaul of the reactor core in Bremerton, Washington with the crew berthed at the Bangor, WA Submarine base. After 
sea trials and sound trials and port visits to Nanaimo, BC; Alameda, CA; and San Diego, CA the Hawkbill surfaced off Waikiki Beach at her new homeport Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. (She actually was returning since Pearl Harbor was from whence she came). The Captain was Fredric Crawford.


In 1982, the USS Hawkbill participated in weekly ops, and a Western Pacific cruise with multiple stops in Yokosuka, Japan; Subic Bay, Philippines; Hong Kong, and Guam. In early 1984, the Hawkbill undertook an under the ice excursion of 87 days with a visit to Chin Hae, South Korea at the end. The Captain on these voyages was George Roletter. There were dependent cruises for the weekend to Lahaina, Maui during the year.


Hawkbill was the last of the short-hull 



Sturgeons


 to be decommissioned. She entered the Navy's Nuclear Powered 
Ship and Submarine Recycling Program on 
1 October 
1999. She was stricken from the 
Naval Vessel Register on 
15 March 
2000 and ceased to exist on 
1 December 
2000.  Her sail is exhibited in the 
Idaho Science Center in 

Arco, Idaho
.

Cherwell School is a state secondary school on the 





Marston Ferry Road




 in 

Oxford
, 

England
. The current school site was built in 1963 as a 
Secondary Modern School, later becoming the main 
Comprehensive School for 



North Oxford


. Along with later expansions, in 2003, and as part of a city-wide reorganisation, it merged with the Frideswide Middle School, and is now a split site school of 1,700 students aged between 11 and 19. Cherwell School's headteacher is Mrs Jill Judson.


The school has no official student newspaper.



Recent changes


The North site is currently undergoing construction work, with the extension of the Sixth form common room. Originally designed to accommodate the 100 students in years 12 and 13, it has become inadequate in recent years for the 300+ students currently in the sixth form.
The main building work is construction of a new building alongside the existing block, and then removing the internal wall to create a much larger space. On the second floor of the structure, the school library is being extended to include quiet study areas, each with computer and desk facilities.
During construction work, the common room remains open for restricted use during break times.
The building work began in the Summer of 2007, and is expected to be completed early 2008. Currently there are limited funds available for the furnishing of this new block, and an appeal has been launched on the school website for donations.

Educational Institute of Scotland





The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) is the oldest 
teachers' 
trade union in the world, having been founded in 
1847 when 
dominies became concerned about the effect of changes to the system of 
education in Scotland on their professional status.


The EIS is currently the largest teaching union in 

Scotland
, and since being granted a 
royal charter by 
Queen Victoria, it is the only union able to award 
degrees.1



References





 1851 Queen Victoria granted a Royal Charter to the EIS. Membership at the time: over 1,800. Among the powers conferred on the EIS was the power to award a degree of  Fellow of the Institute . In 2007, the EIS remains the only trade union which awards degrees.

Mountains of Georgia (U.S. state)
Cobb County, Georgia




Little Kennesaw Mountain is a 
mountain in 

Cobb County, Georgia
, northwest of 

Marietta
 and south of 

Kennesaw
.  Located at 
33 58 14 N 84 35 13 W  /  33.97056, -84.58694, its 
summit stands at 1600 
feet or 488 
meters 
above mean sea level.

It is the diminutive counterpart of (and actually attached to) 

Kennesaw Mountain
, the site of the 

Battle of Kennesaw Mountain
 in the 
1864 

Atlanta Campaign
 of the 

American Civil War
.  


The defensive-minded 

Confederate
 general 


Joseph E. Johnston

 constructed a series of trenches from Kennesaw Mountain to 
Kolb Farm to prevent or delay Union general 
William T. Sherman's approach towards 
Atlanta, Georgia.  For the purpose of defending the Confederate line, the Confederates constructed Fort McBride here, but Little Kennesaw Mountain experienced only skirmishes, with most of the fighting occurring to the south.  Now a part of 

Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park
, the mountain is part of a popular trail that strings from Burnt Hickory Road to the park 
visitor center, traversing Pigeon Hill and both mountains.

A human chain is a form of 
demonstration in which people link their arms as a show of 
political solidarity.


The number of demonstrators involved in a human chain is often disputed; the organizers of the human chain often report higher numbers than 
governmental authorities.

Drakengard, known in Japan as Drag-On Dragoon (           , Doragguon Dorag n), is a 

PlayStation 2
 
role playing game game developed by 
cavia and published by 

Square Enix
 and 
Take Two Interactive. It was released on 
September 11, 
2003 in Japan, on 
March 5, 
2004 in North America and on 
May 21, 
2004 in PAL territories.  It was originally developed by cavia in the 

Enix
 name. Drakengard was 
scored by 
Takayuki Aihara and 
Nobuyoshi Sano.


The game's sequel, 





Drakengard 2




, was released in Japan on 
June 16, 
2005. It takes place 18 years after the events of the original game. 



Gameplay


Drakengard features ground missions, aerial missions, and Free Expedition Mode. It also has two difficulty modes, which are Easy and Normal. The player does not need to erase the game and start over for any reason whatsoever. It is optional to go back to an earlier chapter or verse if the player has missed something. In Drakengard the dragon gains greater attack power as it gains experience and levels up. At certain points of the story the dragon evolves into a different, more powerful form, which enhances the dragons attack powers, magical attacks and allows to lock on to more enemies.


Drakengard is divided into chapters and subdivided into verses. Missions numbered with 
Roman numerals lead to endings other than the one merited in Chapter 8, and can only be played if the player meets certain requirements. The Game has four additional alternate endings. Each of these endings, along with the canonical ending, are achieved by certain events in the game. The first ending deals with Furiae resurrected by Inuart using a Seed of Destruction, and then the second has Angelus revoking her pact with Caim and fighting him to the death. The last two deal with the Grotesqueries revealing themselves and the  world of the gods , Tokyo, is shown in one of them. These last two are used in the sequel to explain the true nature of the world of Drakengard and the Grotesqueries themselves.




Plot



Setting


The game's protagonists are Caim, his best friend Inuart, and their companions.  The plot revolves around a war between the Union and the Empire.  Every 
playable character makes a pact with a powerful beast, and pays a price for joining the pact.  This concept in the Drakengard series is called  pact pricing.  In the process of forging such a pact, humans are branded with a mark called a  pact emblem,  which appears on a part of their body associated with the price they pay - They either lose use of a physical attribute (Voice, Sight, etc), or can lose 'intangible' attributes, such as one's joy, or ability to age. However, the bonds that tie a human with the magical creature he/she made the pact with in life, also binds them both in death as long as the creature allows it so.




Characters



Playable





Caim: Son of the Royal family, Caim was forced to witness the brutal murder of his parents by an Imperial black dragon. Since then, he swore vengeance on the Empire and Dragons, fighting as a soldier in the army of the Union. Mortally wounded, he encountered the red dragon Angelus, who was near death as well. Though he hated dragons, Caim demanded Angelus to accept his offer of a pact that would save both of them. Since then, Caim lost his voice in the exchange, marked on his tongue, and thus the only human Angelus revealed her name out of their new-found respect for each other to before becoming the new seal. Age 24.







 Angelus: A Red 
Dragon that is over 10,000 years old, Caim forced a pact with her in order to live that she reluctantly accepts. Being of a kind revered by others as masters of the natural world, Angelus comes off as arrogant, seeing humans as inferior, careless and defiant. But in time, Angelus made an exception in Caim whom she revealed her name to.


Note: Angelus's name in the Japanese version of Drakengard is  Angel .







Arioch: Arioch was a loving 
elf mother and wife until she was driven mad by the murder of her family at the hands of the Empire. Since then, she has become an insatiable murderess, only a pure joy as her young prey fall victim to her insanity. Formed a pact with 
Undine and 




Salamander



 in exchange for her fertility, marked on her waist. As an ally, Arioch is a threat to herself and others. Age 24.







Seere: Manah's twin brother, he felt it was his fault Manah was neglected/abused by their mother who loved him. Though he shares his sister's magical abilities, he possessed the gift of prophecy. After his village was destroyed, Seere formed a pact with his new found  friend , 
Golem, in exchange for his  time  (the ability to age), marked all over his body, thus can never grow up. He joins Caim's party to search for his lost sister, only to feel more guilt seeing what became of her. Age 6.







Leonard: A kind-hearted man who distasted the horrors of war. But he was constantly tormented by the knowledge of his faults and past mistakes; blaming himself for the deaths of his brothers enough to attempt suicide upon seeing them dead, but couldn't do it. By then, 
Faerie appeared and took advantage of Leonard's instability at the time to force a pact upon him, robbing him of his sight that is marked on his eyes. He befriended Seere, who seemed to remind him of his brothers. Age 32.






Non-playable





Furiae: Caim's younger sister. Raised as a royal princess, she struggled to come to terms with her appointed role as the goddess at the time of her parents' death. As her cursed fate unfolded, Furiae began to despair. Living in her brother's castle, sitting quietly and offer silent prayers. She was abducted by Inuart, as she is the Final Seal that keeps the Grotesqueries when appearing in their world. Age 19.







Hierarch Verdelet: The hierarch whose duty allows him to speak directly with the goddess, Verdelet is a pious man who is always careful of his words and of doing the right thing, but places himself first should the situation becomes dire. When young, he made a pact with a dragon that is now in a petrified state that left a mark on his head, losing his hair and ability to grow more in exchange. In the end of the game, Verdelet performed the sealing ceremony over Angelus. Age 72.







Inuart: Caim's former friend and son of a noble of the kingdom once ruled by Caim's family. Inuart possessed a beautiful singing voice and master of the harp. Though sincere and honest, his heart is weak and relies on his former betrothed, Furiae. But Inuart was taken by the Empire and tortured by them until he swore allegiance to them. He then made a pact with the very Imperial dragon that killed Caim's parents, sacrificing his talent for singing to cement the pact with a mark on his neck. He did this to fulfill his desire to protect Furiae instead of Caim, who was the object of Inuart's jealousy. He battles his former friend, taking Furiae to the Empire where he believed she will be safe. Age 20.







Manah: A mysterious young girl who commands the empire as high priestess of the Cult of Watchers. But the truth, Manah was driven insane by outerworldly entities that she refers to as  the Watchers , who are using her body as a means to direct the Empire in the goal to destroy the world by removing the seals that prevent chaos from ensuring. Prior to it, Manah suffered abuse from her mother, which led to her current state of mind. Though released from her benefactors' control, Manah still dared Caim to kill her so she can find peace. But when Angelus revealed that there is no peace for her, Manah soon realized what she had done and was taken off by Caim and shown the suffering that she had caused so she would  never forget.  Age 6.







The  Grotesqueries : A mysterious otherworldly race that are tied to Manah's possession and would appeared once the seals that keep them out of the world are no more. Though they failed to achieve their goal in the canonical ending, they did in the two alternate endings which revealed them to resemble giant human infants with teeth. They are in turn led by a more human adult-like queen. Their true identity is revealed in Drakengard 2.







Story


Prior to the beginning of the game, Caim's parents were killed by a black 
dragon sent by the Empire, breeding a hatred in him toward both the Empire and dragons. During the war against the Empire, Caim is mortally wounded, but comes across a red dragon imprisoned by the Empire. Although neither Caim nor the dragon are fond of each other, they cannot deny that they need each other's help to survive and become pact partners. The price Caim paid to enter the pact was his voice, rendering him mute and causing a pact emblem to appear on his tongue.


Together, Caim and the dragon fight against the Empire with the help of allies they meet along the way, including other humans, elves, and other pact creatures. Together, they eventually discover that the Empire is led by a six-year-old girl named Manah, high priestess of the Cult of Watchers. Having been driven insane, the young girl has been possessed by otherworldly entities that desire the Goddess and the seals that prevent chaos from overwhelming the world and destroying it. In the end, Caim and the dragon manage to stop them, though the dragon, whose name is revealed to be Angelus at the game's end, volunteers to become the new seal and disappears. This is one of five endings and is the one which leads to the events of Drakengard 2.


The second ending involves Inuart and Furiae after she is killed. Inuart takes Furiae and tries to resurrect her through evil. Although she is revived she is a monster, now having godly powers and wings. She kills Inuart and Caim must now kill his own sister. After doing so you see that although he has killed his own sister, the world is now filled with these creatures that look like Furiae and all is lost.


The third ending contains Caim and Angelus. After Manah sees that things are lost for the empire she tries to summon a dragon but the dragon eats her. All her evil power goes into Angelus, and she now becomes the Chaos Dragon. After becoming this new dragon the pact between Caim and Angelus is broken. But Angelus, although still having respect and love towards Caim feels that if he is not killed all of humanity will be lost. After this fight Caim pulls through and defeats her but after killing her he hears more dragons coming his way. Happy for more killing and fighting you see Caim run outside full speed to battle until his final breath.


The fourth ending consists of Caim, Angelus and Seere. After Seere had to kill his own sister, Manah, the world comes crashing down and all order is lost. Giant babies, also called Grotesqueries, come falling from the sky. They are eating and destroying everything in sight. Arioch sees all these children and becomes obsessed with them. She run towards them and they eat her. Then Leonard sacrifices himself by blowing himself up to clear a path for Angelus, Caim and Seere. After doing this, the Queen Grotesqueries, which looks like a giant woman with no hair, comes up from the ground. Angelus and Caim know that their world is lost without a miracle when they realize what to do. Seere, whose sacrifice for a pact was time, has the ability to freeze time, but he must sacrifice himself. Caim, Angelus and Seere fly towards the Queen Grotesqueries and let Seere drop on top of her. Angelus is then bitten by the Grotesqueries and you see Caim's sword fly through the air as if to say they are both dead. Seere asks for Manah to forgive him and send bursts of light out from him. You then see that the area with the Queen Grotesqueries and all her children are covered in a thick, black fume and time is frozen in the black gas.


In the fifth ending, Caim and Angelus travel across the dimensional boundary to fight the grotesqueries, and in a surprising twist end up flying over modern Tokyo. After defeating the grotesqueries, they are both killed by a fighter pilot that shoots them out of the sky.





Development


Jun Iwasaki, president and 
chief executive officer of Square Enix USA, described Drakengard as a  perfect hybrid of genres  due to its blend of action, character growth influenced by role-playing games, and a  solid story that binds it all together . According to him, the game is intended to appeal to gamers looking for a  deeper action game .1


The Japanese version of Drakengard, Drag-On Dragoon, featured such taboo plot points as incest and pedophilia. However, this was toned down or outright removed from all western versions, but not completely (Angelus: Because you are brother and sister? What manner of excuse is that?).




 Audio 



 Soundtrack 





The Drakengard soundtrack was edited as a twin album, under the names Drag-on Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.1 and Drag-on Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.2. The disc were released in Japan only, and use the game's Japanese title, but they are sometimes referred to in English as  First Attack  and  Second Attack 2. They were released on October 22, 2003 and November 21, 2003, under the catalog numbers MJCG-80125 and MJCG-80137.


The soundtrack were composed by 
Nobuyoshi Sano (    , 
Nobuyoshi Sano)   
Takayuki Aihara (    , 
Takayuki Aihara). Although each track on the album is credited to one artist only, they were said to have worked together on multiple tracks. The music is usually described by critics as experimental and that it wouldn't please everyone. Most of the tracks present repetitive 2 second sounds/samples, that repeat during the entire song, as would an old scratched vinyl disc. During the course of these tracks, those sounds may vary sightly and/or others may be added or removed. The overall result, while not being praised for its musical quality, was highly appreciated for its integration within the game, and its overall corrupt and broken atmosphere.34






 Chapter 10 - In the Sky 






noicon



An especially sound heavy part of the soundtrack. It has no less than 4 different samples playing at in loop simultaneously.Problems listening to the file? See .




 Tracklist 


The titles to the songs are unusually straightforward, merely being the name of the chapter in which they appear. If a chapter has more than two songs, then they are just referred to as 1 and 2. The game's main theme, which is present on the game's trailers is  Route B Staff Roll 'Exhausted' . It is interpreted by 
Eriko Hatsune. Vol.2 Features two songs which were not present in game.

Square Enix
 and 
Macrospace. The game is available in 

English

German
,

 and 

Spanish
.10 It features four different locations and two battle modes: a side-scrolling ground mode and an aerial dragon-riding mode. Achieving high scores unlocks hints and tips for the PlayStation 2 version of the game.11




Reception


Drakengard sold more than 122,000 units in its first week of release in Japan, taking 's place at the top of the sales charts.12




 Censorship 


The Japanese version of the game featured several very adult oriented themes, and many characters had more than questionable sexual orientations and/or perversion. Leonard, in the Japanese version, is actually a pedophile, and Furiae feels sexual desire for her brother. Arioch, who has lost her womb from her pact and gone mad, enjoys killing children. While all of this isn't reflected in the actual game play, it is inside cut scenes and conversations between characters. Most of these were removed in the American version of the game, making certain cut scenes very difficult to understand. For example, when partly possessed by  The Watchers , Furiae chooses to kill herself, rather than reveal her feelings for her brother, but the censorship makes the reasons for her actions very unclear.
